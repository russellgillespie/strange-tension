<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-0"><p>"Bella, Benna, this seems like your area of expertise. What do you make of this glowing toadstool?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look but come up confused.  "These...  are not known to us.  They must be only found in the Feywild.  Did you want us to investigate them further?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yes, let's do. I will inspect it for magical properties."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets about exploring the mushroom in more detail, trying to sense what magic might be emanating from it. He takes a few  spore samples as he does and stows them for later investigation as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>For the purple one...</i>  (Arcana check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't really tell what it is, or what it does, but he gets a sense that it might be hostile if he tries to harm it in any way.  (Con save to get near the yellow ones, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard can get closer enough to a group of yellow fungi without harmful effects of the airborne spores.  That being said, they're still pretty strange looking.  Maouelue doesn't get the sense that they're magical, though.  They might have some interesting properties, but further examination would need to be done.  (An alchemist would have proficiency on investigation checks for this, fyi.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue gets closer into the area, he sees that getting past these mushrooms without touching them might be a tricky business.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"On second thought...let me take a slightly different vantage on these...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves back and directs his familiar to harvest some of the species and return them to a  piece of parchment he lays out for the purpose.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard familiar is able to get a good quantity of yellow mushroom.  And, for good measure, was able to take a chunk out of the purple one, too.  Just as it flew in and out for the last time, a spore cloud caught it and he flew straight through.  (Con save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok, well...now I’ve got these mushrooms...  Now...Where the <i>hell</i> are we?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just past the mushroom cavern, the group sees carved stone walls with a hall moving off to the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“In for another shroom, in for another room I always say... Let’s head on!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They move to the hall....on the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the quartet moves through the mushroom minefield, they enter the carved room structure, looking as if it were either constructed by someone or something, or possibly transposed into this mountain somehow.  The hall, beautifully carved stone throughout, carries on for about 25 feet then opens into another small room.  Halfway down the hall is another offshoot to the right (leading W).</p><p>(Roll20 is updated, btw.)</p></div>
