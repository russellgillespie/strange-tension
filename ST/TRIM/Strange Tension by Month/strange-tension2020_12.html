<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Need to ask about Dieter's condition/recovery, i.e. did any of that count as restful SR or LR?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(He's pretty beat up, he's at half his hit points and wounds are prevalent on his body.  He's probably recovered all of his spell slots, too, but something seems off about his magic.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ok interesting. how about his wildshape?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first thing Dieter does is try to use his powers to turn into an animal.  He focuses...  and it's strange. Normally he can feel the warp and weave of the natural magic around him.  Now, he just feels the cold emptiness of dank, damp air.  He shivers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Shit. Shit shit shit! What am I going to do. Where the hell is Maouelue?... Shit. What a mess back there. And the henchmen! Uuuuugh. The hallucination, the battle, now this? Dear me...no magic...what is this foul darkness. After so long underground, a breath of light and air and trees....but now this. Sigh. Time to get down to it Dieter. We've got to figure a way out of this mess. Yes. Yes we do.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter quickly shuts his eyes, but leaves one half cracked open. He lies there trying to get his bearings without being noticed awake.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Switching out of italics for main so I can actually use them for thoughts now.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter blinks several times as his vision comes to. He takes in the carving main's appearance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume stares back at you, whittling but not watching what he is doing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A pall permeates Dieter's face. His core seems to turn to an anvil. There's no avoiding this now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"So we meet again."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Was wondering when you'd be waking, laddie.  Howse the body?  Anything broken?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Does <i>spirit</i> count?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He frowns, shrugs, thinks.  "No.  I suppose you thought you'd win that fight.  Hells be true, I thought you would as well.  Came through everything else.  Was hoping to have this conversation with the both of you boys, too, but here we are.  Don't think of it as a knock on your talents, lad.  That magus friend of yourn is...  he's a wily one!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume stops carving, stands and stows the knife and wood.  He squats on his haunches next to you, like he's ready for a quiet conversation.   He motions to the shackles.  "May I?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks at him cautiously, questioningly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Just what is your role in all this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles.  "At the moment?  Just trying to get these off'n ye."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter nods in assent</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man smiles, reaches into his mouth, scratching the inside of his cheek with a thumb.  He pulls out a small jagged metal bit, and proceeds to unlock Dieter's bonds.  Once they're off, he sets them quietly on the floor, with a finger pressed against his lips in a, <i>Shhh</i> motion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The continuously re-bewildered druid sets his bare feet down silently on the cold hard ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So, when you boys didn't come quietly, the boss...  he didn't like that very much.  Sent me to keep old Culver company here.  He's been unconscious for awhile now, nothing I can do to wake him.  Funny thing about these old places," he steps to a dark corner of the cell.  He studies it a moment, then kicks out with a dirty boot.  A small section of the wall moves in, a flicker of light can be seen below.  "Secrets abound."  He smiles again at you. </p><p></p><p>"Here's the thing.  There's going to be a guard coming down the way in a few.  They check up on us, but not always consistently.  My guess, if we wait for the next pass, then leave right after, we should get a good head start, eh?"</p><p></p><p>"Plus...  leaves us time to catch up."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye. But...how do I know I can trust you? You say 'The Boss' like a joiner. Pardon my wariness, but...as you can imagine..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"...my instinct to trust is a bit...riven."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"To be expected, to be expected for sure.  And you can't trust me.  Shouldn't trust me, I should say.  I don't work at causes, but I 'join' where the money is.  Or power.  Truthfully," he leans in, "I'm in it for the loot, lad!  I'd rather rob a thousand houses, crawl through a million forgotten dungeons, if I can find a lost artifact or ancient text.  Not that I can use any of that shite.  But they do fetch a pretty sum, to the right buyers."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"In an effort to be a bit more trustworthy, I should say <i>that's</i> the real reason I was down in those caves.  I'd been looking for that tomb for some time, now.  Got what we could, but I didn't find all of what the boss was after.  He's pissed about that, too.  Oh well.   What are ye gonna do, am I right?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Mercenaries...<i>Fight for a cause, but don't die for it...</i> That's how the saying goes, right?," He considers a moment. "Well, I'm no stranger to a bit of loot lust either, but I won't forsake my companions." His eyes turn to Culver. "We must do something about him. What's his part in all this. That's where it all started for Maouelue and me. I would see our rescue completed if such a cause be just."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks over at the lump on the bed.  He sucks his teeth, considering.  "The old man has taken a beating, that's for sure.  But don't you worry yourself about it, he wasn't taken on your account.  Word around the water barrel is that he owed the boss some money, decided to renege on his side of the bargain.  Him meeting you boys was incidental at best.  The boss decided to use his disappearance to lure you both, that's about all.  He'll come around soon, hopefully.  You good with leaving him here if we have to?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter agonizes over this a moment. "I suppose we've gotten in enough trouble on his account already. Aye, we'll leave him if needs be. But, it sounds like this Boss has a comeuppance in his future...I'll make sure of that."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume shrugs and sits back down on his dingy cot.  The mildew smell is quite strong and he coughs, spits into an empty corner of the room.  "So, did you find out more about that bastard Muhlen?  Any more tricks up his sleeve in that goblin infested hovel he called a vault?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"More than a few tricks indeed. I'm not sure if we found more of his after you...did you run or were you taken?...I suppose it matters little at this point. We forged a bit of our own fortune down there, then sought sanctuary above. Only to find...well, I guess you know that part now."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I have a question though...what in the bloody hells happened to my power down here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah, right.  To be true, I was...  recalled.  Had to leave you boys, didn't want to, but when you're compelled...  Nothing much you can do, eh?  As for the magics down here.  We're in some sort of prison complex.  It's pretty vast, but it has a lot of secrets, as I showed you there."  Points at the exit.  "Well, it seems that this prison was set up for spell casters and magic users of all types.  My guess, we're in an anti-magic shell.  Or maybe there's a mythallar somewhere around, but you best pray that's not the case!  We'll all get blown to smithereens if that thing goes wonky!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You say <i>recalled</i>...<i>compelled</i>...By what means? I'd rather not fall into any unavoidable traps on account of...whatever mechanism that is if you take my meaning."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He scratches his stubble.  "Let's just say...  the boss keeps a close grasp on what's dearest to me.  Sometimes I find it hard to say no, if you catch my drift.  He's a magic user, he can speak to me whenever he wants.  So, yeah, anyone with me would be at danger from him scrying or spying or whatever the Hells he does.  We can split this place and then part ways, if you're happier with that.  I just thought...  well.  I thought I at least owed you a conversation before I took off, if that makes sense.  No honor among thieves, as it were, but...  just seemed the right thing to do.  You and your mage friend are good people.  Owed you as much."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Understood. I suppose we'll cross that chasm when we come to it. Let's keep an ear for the guard and get ready to make our escape."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye." His look bores into Dieter, trying to gain some insight into his bearing.  After a few moments, he says, "One last thing.  Did you happen to find anything about a red crystal, 'bout yea big?"  He holds up his fist.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for a bit, be back soon!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Can’t recall seeing anything like that...Mind’s a bit hazy though, i suppose.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
He looks deep into your eyes.  After an uncomfortably long time, metal clanks down the hallway outside of the cell.  A humanoid comes into view, he's armored in a variety of garments: a plate helm that doesn't fit, a studded leather cuirass, dark metal pattens, and a kilt-like chain skirt/pant.  The man walks up to the bars, looks through.  After a few moments, apparently satisfied, they nod and walk back down the hall, out of sight.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Now?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume gets up, waits at the barred window for a beat.  "Can't hear or see 'em, let's go."  He heads to the corner, pushes the moveable wall, and, little by little, an opening appears.  Torchlight flickers on a wooden ladder leaning against a wall.  Looking down the opening, it's only about an eight foot drop.  Frume offers for Dieter to go first.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sure, what the hell."</p><p>He squeezes in and slides down.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a rather tight fit, and when Dieter gets to the bottom, the tunnel that stretches before him is only five feet tall.  They'll both have to hunch while they're walking.   A lit torch is illuminating the hall as well as a intersection opening to the left and right 10-15 feet ahead.  (Roll20 is live!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The dilapidated Druid moves to and peeks around the corners.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another hallway.  Going left there's an opening to t he right, opposite on the right side.  The hall looks like it was carved hurriedly with shoddy tools; there are gashes and marks on the walls like blade cuts.  The floor is loose, dried clay.  Walking normally, Dieter and Frume slip on the scree and are probably going to be fighting with their footing all the way through.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They slyly slink...left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another long hallway ending in what looks like a mold-infested wall.  Two openings are on the left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is also getting dim down the hallways, now.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of light farther in the tunnels.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to move back and take the torch from the wall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The torch comes off easily, and you sense that it is magically lit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Sensing the magic in the torch, Dieter looks for any loose pebbles on the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How many do you want?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(3 to start)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter spies a few pebbles which would work well with his plans. (😁)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He...tries his stony cantrip.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A crackling comes from the druid's hands.  (Give me an arcana check, then a dex save.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The magic goes through, but not without consequences.  A sharp pain slices through Dieter's mind, sending him to his knees.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter rubs his temples, each of which just felt a short sharp shock. “Well, these will come in handy at least. Might need to wait a bit longer before trying that again. And surely I shouldn’t go all firestarter anytime soon.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"We need to get us some weaponry.  Who knows what's down here.  I've heard some strange stories."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Do you know where they took our things?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, back at the head of that hall.  We might be able to find a way up, but it might be better to beg off that stuff.  You have anything you can't part with in your pack?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...a great. many. things.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But let us not needlessly throw ourselves into the lions den. I’ll search with you down here for some means to recover what was stolen.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye.  Lets make our way...  west.  Should be that way, might be able to find a way up.  Still think the best way out is through these catacombs."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Frume. Let us continue on cautiously. Stand back and if I am apprehended, you flee.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pushes up to the next corner and peeks around.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Like hell I will.  No one gets outta here alive on their own.  Least that's what I heard.  Nothing down here we can't handle, right?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Right. Let’s do this.” Dieter stops himself a moment. “You think there’s equipment in the catacombs?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I think there might be.  Could be rusted all to shite, but it'll be better than anything we got at the moment."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the pair peer left, they see a wall at the end of a very short hall.  (Perception check, please!  Also, afk for kiddos bedtimes.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool. me too soon.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter senses that there's something off about the wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks for a non-magical stone to throw at it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter tosses a rock at the wall...  and it passes through.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Sheeeiiiiiit. Let’s go!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You might be too excited about this, let me head in first.  If there is someone over there, they might recognize me."  He pushes by and steps through the barrier.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Now what is this guy up to?...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume picks his head back through. </p><p>"You're...  You're gonna wanna see this.  Put something over your nose, first, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter finds two lesser pebbles with which to snuff his snout, then follows Frume.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Great visual!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What in the buddy Bahamut is this!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You walk into a nightmare.  Bloody implements are hanging on the wall and strewn about tables.  Blood is staining the walls and floor, some dried, some still very wet.  A trail is coming from a wooden door in the N wall.  On the table against the W wall, a dissected body is displayed.  Parts of the man's body and sections of skin have been completely removed.  (Perception check or Investigation if you want something specific.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter walks over to the body and tries to remember the rituals depicted in the vault. Was this akin to any of them? Was there a pattern to this...vivisection? <i>And just what kind of implements do we have here?</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume...do you know about any of this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I knew they were doing experiments down here, but I just thought it was of the arcane persuasion.  Trying to break the anti-magic barrier, that sort of thing.  This..."  He looks like he's going to be sick.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks over the body.  It does look familiar to what you've seen before in the vault, more depraved though.  Not a specific pattern that he can tell.  There are all sorts of torture, butchering, and slicing equipment.  If you wanted to grab something as a weapon, you'll have a selection to choose from.  (Investigation check for weaponry.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(fml lol)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Guess we'll have to do this with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find 3 rusted daggers, caked in blood.  You also find one <i>very</i> sharp sickle.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Guess these'll have to do." He takes a sickle and a dagger and hands the other two to Frume.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Been a while since I used one of these, but...it's just like riding a dolphin."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume also finds a rusted dagger and a makeshift club.</p><p>"Thank ye, friend.  Ne'er had a chance to ride a dolphin.  Gods willing, I'll be able to try when I get back to the sea!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah the sea...Someday Frume. And I haven't forgotten about our promise either..." He looks meaningfully at the crippled man and then blushes at handing him two daggers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well anyway...you can throw them too...Never can have...enough...daggers."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You notice as you hand him the daggers...   his has both of his hands.</p><p>"Aye, true!"  He flips the two with both hands, then pockets them.  He's got the dagger in his left hand, the club in his right.  "To the door, then?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter blinks in amazement. "Well...I guess...now I know why I forgot! What in the nine– How?!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"How, what?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Your–Your handS!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the hand, yeah!  Had a good healer in camp.  And someone willing to lend me a...  hand!  Eh?  Eh?  All right, lets go through the door.  You checking it for traps, or should I?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A javelin emerges from the floor and spears the thief in the foot.  He hops through the door, slips on more blood on the floor, and falls prone.  In front of a pile of dead bodies, all in various states of decay.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are two alternative exits to this room, wooden doors the same as the one Frume just went through.  Both are closed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You ok?”, Dieter asks as he gingerly steps over the trap and peers around the room, instinctively turning left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Sure, I'll be okay.  What the fuck is this?!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Percep or Investigation, if you want.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I’m glad Maouelue isn’t here to see this...”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are many species and types of bodies in the pile.  As Dieter takes a closer look, he realizes that these bodies are missing skin and other parts as well.  There is a table in the far NW corner of the room.  Things are growing from several dishes and bowls.  The smell is awful; gag-inducing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter reluctantly takes a closer look at the table, holding his breath best he can.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>At another time, Dieter would normally have spent hours pouring over the contents of this table.  It looks like experiments are being done with bodily fluids and different funguses and molds.  (Insight or Investigation for more.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Whomever put this together was trying to grow certain foods and cultures from mixing bodily fluids with blood and water.  A couple are doing okay, but the rest have gone into putrescence.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leaves the abominable table and heads to the south door checking it for traps.</p>

<p>When Dieter approaches the door, a sparkle of blue-green catches his eye.  There is a gem in the middle of the door, catching the light of their torch at odd angles.  Dieter can also sense Frume picking over the bodies, searching them.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(Arcana check on the stone, please!)</p>

<p>It's tough to pinpoint, but you know it has something to do with conjuration magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, have you seen anything like this from the Runemark before?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No.  No idea what that is.  Want me to try to pick it out?"  He waggles a dagger.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm... let's test it out first before you lose that hand again. Dieter goes to grab a bit of something from the pile and throws it at the mark."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>That really hits Frume's funny bone and he starts giggling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What would you like to throw at the gem?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(A stray bit of body part from the pile)</p>

<p>Dieter grabs a spare foot, it <i>pops</i> off with a <i>squelch</i>.  He tosses the foot at the door.  It hits the gem.  A gross splotch is left on the gem and the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm...well I didn't really expect that to work." Dieter takes a Magic Stone and throws it at the gem.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stone hits the gem and vanishes.  You hear a <i>clack</i> coming from the room you just came from.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, can you see what that was?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He heads back, brings Dieter his stone seconds later.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How strange. Here, go watch again while I throw."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The pair make to do just that.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stone hits the gem square on, it disappears.  The <i>clack</i> comes from the other room again. </p><p>"Shite, it just appeared out of nowhere!  That's amazing!"  He brings Dieter back his stone again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ok one more time. Stand back and see where it comes from."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Dieter slightly inserts his dagger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger slides off the gem to the edge where it meets the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, bewildered, tries at the handle to open the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You disappear and reappear in the middle of the butcher room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"..."  Frume stares at you, eyebrows raised.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well would you look at that! Maybe do try and pull that gem Frume. We could use something like that surely, if it will come out that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"On it!"  Frume sticks the dagger in the edge and pries.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah.  This is sticking more than I thought.  You wanna give it a go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sure thing. Let's see how sharp this sickle is. Maybe if we each take a side..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The two each take a blade and begin worrying away at the facets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with adv!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gross)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yikes!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume kicks the door in frustration.  He disappears and reappears in the butcher room.  Dieter hears a muffled, "Fuck!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah the hell with it. Let's just move on." They head North, it being the leftmost remaining route.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens with a squeak and squeal.  The musty room is filled with sacks, crates, and a few small barrels.  One is leaking in the back of the room, a puddle pooling beneath it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They two give the provisions(?) a once-over.</p>

<p>Most of the bags are beans or grains, their freshness is in question.  Plus, all of the foodstuffs in here have been around the ill-smelling table maybe too long.  Dieter finds some jerky that might be okay.  Just as he turns to give some to Frume, he hears a skittering from the ceiling...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume wipes the last few spiders away from himself and Dieter, and with a deft swipe of his dagger and stamp of his boot, the swarm is no more.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What's the chance that's the worst living thing we see down here?"</p>

<p>(afk a bit.)</p>

<p>Dieter checks the far wall of the corridor for any more shenanigans.</p>

<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't tell if there are any more shenanigans or not.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gives it up and head back south to the other hallway.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Now just what do we have here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, brother, been overly busy today.  Trying to cram all my honey-do stuff into one day!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries man. I was out most of the day anyway.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter moves from the pantry and through the rooms to one of the main halls, Frume follows, giving a longing look at the gem-door.  Dieter moves to the end of the hall.  There the hall turns left, ending ten feet away with a door on the N end.  Several holes are cut into the clay wall.  Inset in the holes are several skulls, lit candles in the center.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Before the left turn, the N wall is covered with green mold, almost like algae.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(where are those rolls when i’m pulling a dope magical gem out of the wall eh? 😆)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll try it again, I'm sure!  Not to be too big of a buzzkill, but I'm going to call it a night, sir.  I'll be back at it asap tomorrow.  Sorry Russ.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(me too dude! fancy dinner with the fam tonight. hope your weekend is good!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no apologies!!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Dieter braves the muck, wipes the slime away from a revealed iron door.  There are strange runes on it, one of which he can read.  It says: *column*.  The door is either stuck or locked.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength or slight of hand check to try and open the door!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume comes over to help. He places a dagger at where he believes the hinges to be, working the corner while Dieter tries again.  (Another, with advantage.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Thanks Frume.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger slips, the door creaks a bit.  But it remains shut.  "For the love of all that's holy, why are the doors down here impossible to get through?  It's almost like they don't want anything moving around down here, eh?"  He gives Dieter a dark look.</p><p>"Fuck it, lets try this."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door hits a low note, <i>bong</i>, but does not yield.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Worth a shot, I guess.  Looks like there's a door at the end of the hall."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm... Maybe we’ll find a means of opening it elsewhere.”</p><p>Dieter inspects the door for a locking mechanism.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is feeling exceptionally mediocre today.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Apparently so is Frume!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two look over the door.  Is doesn't have a keyhole, however there is a gem inset in the center.  This one is a dull brown.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“How’s that loot lust of your doing there eh Frume? Wanna give this one a go together?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, always a lustful man, Dieter, don't ever think otherwise!  We breaking down the door or trying to remove the gem?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The gem friend. The gem.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with adv!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gem <i>pop</i> comes out in Dieter's hand.  The door <i>creaks</i> open.  The light shines on an unadorned room.  Rough clay all over, but there are a few piles of dust or ash on the ground.  In the middle of the room stands a stone column.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Crap, I should have had you do a Constitution save when you did your last Arcana check, but we'll say you passed, that was my fault.  Anything magic related down here will have that save attached, at least for the moment.  If you want to check on the gems properties, Arcana check, then a Con save.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Damn, well... okay then!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gem is imbued heavily with conjuration magic.  When inset into a wooden object like a door or a chest, it acts as a magical lock of sorts.  When the person trying to unlock fails their check, the wooden object grows a mouth with sharp teeth and attacks said person.  To set it into a wooden object takes an arcana check DC 13, with subsequent tries going up by DC 1.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I suppose we should inspect this here pedestal, eh?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter beckons Frume over to the stone structure. He kneels down and looks around it’s base and searches for any markings that might betray its secrets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Intelligence and history checks, please!  Also, throw a perception with adv on there too, for fun!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume enter the cubic room, the torchlight illuminating further in.  There is a wooden door at the E end of the N wall.  The dust doesn't stir much as they walk about.  The column is made of stone, not clay.  All four sides have fine ornamentation on them, intricate writing seems to scroll within the ornamentation.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have a keen sense that I’m being really obtuse about this obelisk.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter has never seen anything quite like this, nor has Frume.  You both get the feeling, looking over the script, that not many alive have ever seen anything like this, either.  As you pour over the intricate tracing, Frume pokes Dieter on the shoulder and says, "Look at that!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
On the north wall, script comes into view, burning red-orange against the dirty brown clay.  It is graciously in common, and it reads:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>You can kiss me, but never on my cheek</i></p><p><i>You can see me face to face, but never shall we meet</i></p><p><i>We look alike, but not the same</i></p><p><i>When I go away, it is not I to blame</i></p><p><i>In water, glass, or steel, we can touch but never feel</i></p><p><i>We were born on the same day; all the same habits, act the same way</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You are my reflection.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On the closest side towards Dieter, the stone turns to liquid, then resolves to a mirror sheen.  First, Dieter can see his own reflection.  Then, the image shimmers and a woman is standing there.  She is human, average height, into her later years.   Her graying brunette hair is held back by a kerchief, and the clothes she wears are vibrant and heavily patterned.  She smiles.  Then a kindly voice enters your head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You may ask me any one question."  She waits expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“How is my destiny intertwined with these dark serpents, a shadow of the light cast by my miraculous companion?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman cocks her head.  Her eyes sparkle in the torchlight, which seems to not only illuminate the room you're in, but hers as well.  "There are many roads you may travel, however each will lead you to your dark serpents.  The World Devourer waits for you and your companions.  The shadows are not the opposite to Bahamut's Chosen, but an aspect of the Great Dragon's duality, Tiamat.  While the races of elves stem from the various gods, all serpent races, including the Ancients, stem from the Great World Serpent.  At this time, there are those who are trying to open a rift in the material plane for the Great World Serpent.  Yet, there are those who are twisting their minds in order to bring Bahamut's nemesis to Faerun.  If this happens, all may be lost."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles kindly at you.  "Do not lose hope, dear Druid.  You may not have the strength now.  Follow your heart and trust in your friends.  The road will lead you to where you need to go.  Be sure you're learning to be ready for the battle when the time comes."  Smiling, she fades into Dieter's reflection.  Then the stone façade returns to the surface, and the words disappear.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That was a really good question!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(great answer!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stares transfixed at the spot where his oracle has just disappeared, his mind transfixed on what he has just heard. He stares, motionless, ruminating, stoic.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What happened there?  You see something I'm missing?"  Frume in going all over the column, unable to understand why Dieter's been staring at it intently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter’s attention is wrested from the column by Frume’s voice. </p><p>“Whoowha???”</p><p>“Oh! Frume. Ahhh, yes um. There was a...sort of vision? I can’t explain. Anyway, it won’t do to dally here. Onward my good man.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That's okay, that's just fine.  Didn't want you completely disappearing on me.  Hey, whatdya say we go try that blue gem again?  If we need to get your gear, we're kinda going the wrong way."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I suppose it can't hurt, now we've figured out how to pry them out. Let's do it!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leads back to the gemmed door.</p>

<p>"Agh! This fucking thing! Frume, I don't know if it's going to budge..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume gets an crazy look in his eye.  He looks to the door.  Then to the noxious table.  Then back to the door.  He gets down on his hands and knees, checking the bottom of the door.  He says, "Wanna try something?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I checked. It was the same. 1/400 chance for that shit)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's like when you guys were pummeling the knight!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I can see you're not going to let this go easily. Aye, I'll follow your lead."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Well now I have to know)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Standing and heading toward the pile of bodies.  He tears some strips of cloth and brings them to the table, ushering Dieter over.  "If this doesn't work, or it takes too long, we'll search more."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(looks like the first several were no adv, then Mao took two adv at the end that also missed.)</p>

<p>The first few, nothing happens.   On the fourth, a small explosion lights up the table and the smell of ozone fills the air.  Frume smiles at Dieter.  "That's a winner!  Remember that one."  He continues.  Another does something similar.  Unfortunately, his enthusiasm reaches a bit too far.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He reaches a small red vial, the contents are thick and it looks almost like a solid mass instead of a liquid.  Frume drops the flaming bit of cloth into it.  Nothing happens for a second, two... three.   Then, the inside of the vial turns a bright orange, the vial balloons out...</p>

<p>He is able to find the first beaker of putrescence and he sets it under the door.  "Just set it on fire, laddie!  I remember from some of my sailing days, we found some dead bodies on a beach.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(<i>muffled</i>) "You good to go?  Let's get it!"  Frume runs at the flaming door.  He hits the door with his shoulder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter follows, with a shake of the head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door comes down and Frume pats down his clothes, checking for fire.  "Fun, right?!"  He smiles widely at Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall is short and it turns sharply to the right.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You know what?!? That <i>was</i> fucking fun!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter likes this bit of reckless indifference. It's an interesting change of pace.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ha!"  He thumps you on the shoulder, then heads to the break in the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The subsequent hallway goes north and south.  The light illuminates the whole length.  There's a dead-end to the N, to the S it takes a sharp turn E.  There, unfortunately, is a heavy stench of urine that is starting to be covered by the smoke stench.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I can't fucking breathe in here for much longer. Let's hurry!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter runs to the South corner.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another short hall.  A hall to the N, then another at the far end to the S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter scopes out both turns.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short hallway on the N ends in a locked door.  The door to the S button-hooks around to head W.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Druid dives on forward S and W.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall curves north and ends in a locked door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Work is kicking my ass right now, dude, sorry.  Gonna be a bit until I can rev it up here.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How do you want to take care of this door?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Same. we can catch up later.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, I've always wanted to kick down a door. You with me?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Let's do this, boyo!"</p><p>(Strength check with adv, or attack roll - if you have unarmed attack - with adv.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door buckles, shakes.  Dust rains down from the cavern hall ceiling and comes back at the two from the shaking door.  A crack sounds, but the door still stands strong in the doorway.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is moaning coming from beyond the door.  Sounds like a handful of entities, all groaning loudly and approaching.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Uhhh, on second though, maybe we try the other door?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, shaking his head at the door.  "Woulda been interesting if we knocked it down in one, eh?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye. Aye aye aye."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Why do I get the feeling you're enjoying this?" <i>He winks.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Could be me smile!" He smiles wide.  "Ahoy, lets see what else is gonna try and kill us down here!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed. Maybe we listen a bit more closely <i>prior</i> to kicking this one in, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, then shakes his head, chuckling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leans his ear up to the seam in the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh dieter...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seems fine.  You should totally go in.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ok, this one's all clear. Let's do this!!!"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door is unlocked and swings wildly in, banging against the interior wall.  The room is dimly lit by a small forge sitting against the north wall.   Various packs and belongings are scattered here and there, giving this room a look of being lived in, opposed to some of the other rooms you've visited.  There is a large tapestry on the E wall.  (Religion check for more info.)  There is also a ladder in the NW corner leading to a wooden trapdoor.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(HA!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume is still very interested in whatever is behind you guys, so he is wandering off back down the corridor.  Dieter senses a whirring, whoosing sound, but can't seem to see where the sound is coming from.  Doesn't seem like this room would have a draft...</p><p></p><p>As Dieter looks at the tapestry further, it is beautifully made, but very old.  Soot stains the majority of the fabric, but a simple decoration of a castle on a hill with various villagers and houses dotting the landscape can be seen.  Dieter looks closer, though, and through the simple weavings, he can see something else unfolding.  He puts his face almost right against it, staining his nose black with soot.  This might be the <i>back</i> of the original tapestry...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(There really is magic in the rolls)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes note of the whirring but decides to take a look at the back of the tapestry first.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The druid throws the tapestry off of the wooden pegs holding it to the wall.  It falls in the middle of the floor.  There a picture unfurls.  A five-headed dragon stands on a hillside, overlooking rows and rows of soldiers.  The five heads each unleash their own special attack, and the soldiers are decimated under the might of this beast.  There is a scroll in the bottom of the tapestry, apparently setting the title of the piece: "*The Victory of Our Dragon Queen*".

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume hears the commotion and comes in, looking at the picture as well.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(work meeting)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Good lord!" He notices Frume entering, "Have you ever seen anything like <i>this?</i>"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Never.  Looks like a good knit, too.  Must be one of the Cult pieces, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I suppose so." Dieter takes a few minutes to commit the scene to memory, then goes in search of the noise, pressing his ears to the various wall whence the whirring is emanating.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks, searches, strains to hear and see what he was missing initially.  Nothing shows.  The small, hot fire crackles near the forge, that's all he hears now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Still bewildered, he begins knocking on the walls to try an hear any echoes beyond.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No sounds emanate from the knocking, the walls are solid clay.  Scree falls here and there, but other than that, nothing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(can i see the room in r20 pls?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, shit, my bad!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(NP!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Frustrated at his seeming hallucination, Dieter makes his way to the SW door and checks for signs of traps mechanisms before checking whether it is locked.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation for traps and locked-ness... 😀)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter, wary of these doors down here, searches for traps.  Finding none, he checks the door.  It turns easily in his hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank goodness." He enters cautiously and casts glances around.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short hall awaits beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He proceeds to the end and looks...left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>...and again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid looks upon the end of the hall to a storage area, of sorts.  An armor stand is visible, holding a fine chain shirt.  There is a weapon rack attached to the E wall with two gleaming short swords.  A long sword is leaning against the NE corner.  At the base of the armor stand, a small chest is opened, revealing two standard potions of healing, and a third potion which Dieter is unable to identify on sight.</p><p>(I couldn't get the items set up visually in Roll20, sorry!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, ever cautious in this never-ending maze, peers over the items as it it's too good to be true. He looks again for any traplike shennanigans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No traps, everything looks legit.  Nothing yells out at being magical at first glance, but everything looks very well made.  Maybe even elven in make.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Maouelue would love to see these...I hope he gets to some day..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I was looking at some rules for checking potions.  If you want to test it by tasting a bit, you would have to do a Constitution save, or your could roll an Arcana check as well, depending on whether or not you think it would hurt you.  Depending on the type or poison it could be, the effect would probably be minimal if you were just to take a droplet to see what the effect of the potion is.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Thinking fondly of his friend and the forge they made together, he swallows his misgivings about the metal armor in deference to practicality, then dons the rest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I would try arcana first)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The chain shirt is exceptionally lightweight, fitting well to you.  The weapons seem light in your grip as well.  </p><p>(Roll arcana - at your own risk!   Mwahahaha!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Eh Frume...I know my stuff is up there, but do you think we had better clear this place before heading up? You never know what we might find and that just might be the advantage we need up there, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"True, true.  But who knows how big this place is.  It's all over the place, I can't get a read on it.  Not to mention whoever was dissecting those bodies.  Rather not meet them without a bunch o' fighters at my back, I'll tell you true."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Frume doesn't pass out, but he puts his hand back on the ladder to steady himself.</p>

<p>"Time for me to help <i>you</i> friend. Let's head back to where we found the chest and take a moment to recover before we go further."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter offers a shoulder to lean on and helps support Frume back down the corridor to the secluded space by the small chest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He tries to close the door behind them and find a way to secure it from opening. He considers a moment, then reaches in his pocket and pulls out the latent gem. He smirks, then pushes it into the door.</p>

<p>"Whoa, whoa, lad.  Here, looks like we're both feeling low.  Let's just rest here."  He sits propped up on the nearest wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agreed. Go on and head up and I'll be right behind you."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods to you, looking determined.  He climbs the ladder, each rung clasp echoing raspingly in the clay room.  As he gets to the hatch, he whispers down to Dieter, "There's a catch here, I'm going to slide it quiet and try to peek through."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Without any sounds, even to Dieter, Frume undoes the clasp and opens the hatch.  Then, quicker than a snake bite, he clambers up through the opening and opens the trapdoor completely.  He offers you a hand.  "We gotta be quick about this.  No one's here but there's bound to be someone soon.  Les go!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter follows quickly, astounded at the silent lightning that is his companion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two enter in a roughly 30x30ft room, cluttered with desks and parchment.  A table is pushed into a corner, where four chairs surround it, a card game interrupted lay on it's top.  No one is in the room, but you both can hear sounds of talking coming from down a hallway to the <s>N</s>  South.  You both come up into what is essentially the center of the room.  (I don't really have this up in Roll20, did you want a board or is theatre of the mind okay?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Heading into a meeting Back in an hour or so)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Theatre of the mind is just fine! Can we distinguish the emotional candor of the voices in conversation?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yeah, I think so.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room also has a hallway going off to the W.   There are no sounds coming from that direction.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check to see if you can hear what they're saying.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(the ones Dieter! The ones!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They seem pretty garbled.  Unlike the underground rooms, these up here are all made of fitted stone, and poorly kept, so the echoes are furious.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I think one of 'em is saying something about a lost prisoner...  Shite.  I think we make a run for it, but we need to be stealthy."  He looks around the room.  "Where in the bloody blazes did they put that trunk?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter examines the parchment and takes the playing cards for himself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is looking for names, places, plans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They're a deck of Three Dragon Ante, a very popular game in Faerun.  The parchment are various edicts and dictates about the law and how the questioning of prisoners should go.   Several are signed, they all look relatively official.  They've been strewn about the room, though, as if they're been gone over for information.  (Investigation if you want more info.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to perceive who is signing off on these papers and who might be the authorities involved, as well as whether the Runemark are for or against whomever has signed these.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The papers look old, and it's almost as if they've been magically protected against age, too.  The dates on some of them are outrageous, nowhere near where Dieter knows the date to be.  (Dieter sees the year 3129 on them, with a strange month tag that he doesn't recognize.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is nothing within the papers that he recognizes as belonging to the Runemark.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Do you keep looking through the papers?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes 3 of the more interesting looking ones and begins to usher Frume out of the room quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(North or West?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They move West out of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the duo heads out of the room, moving down the westward corridor, the sounds of talking start getting louder from the northern passage.  The two exit just as a pair of voices enter the room behind them.  (Stealth checks, with advantage, please!)</p>

<p>"Oughta get hazard pay for this shit, can't believe they're having us mount to look for these assholes.  They're probably still in the fucking castle.  I say, take every floor, search every room.  But no, no one listens to me."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oy, aren't you the one that said they're probably in the catacombs?  You're fulla horseshit!  I think Rock is right, they're way off'a the grounds.  Someone helped 'em escape, probably someone close to that Bander guy, and they're making a run for it.  Gonna be their surprise, nowhere to run to, aye?"  </p><p></p><p>The first voice is gruff, hardened, frustrated.  A man looking to take out some repressed emotions in the form of extreme physical violence.  The other has a rather rat-like sound to his voice.  Nasally, with words spat quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two sound like they're rummaging around the room for something.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume head further down the hall, into an area with rows of cell doors.  Some are bars on hinges where you can see into the cell.  Others are like the door Dieter and Frume were behind, heavy oak with banded iron bracings.  The latter are at the end of the hallway.  The very last one is standing ajar, an arm flopped outside of the opening.  As Dieter takes a few steps, Frume catches his arm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cell door to their immediate right is lined with several chests.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gives a muffled start and looks at where Frume is beckoning. He checks the door as if to open it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens...  (Sleight of hand check, let's see if it squeaks 😟)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter takes his time, knowing the two thugs are basically right behind them.  Ever so slowly, he checks the handle.  It comes open with no sound, no resistance.  He looks around and with the caution born of survival, and the patience born of being a child of nature, he opens the door enough to let both he and Frume in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are three chests in this cell, the first one is wide open, nothing of importance is inside.  The second and third are against the remaining walls, both are closed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Frume, stay by the door for now and keep watch while I check these out.”, Dieter whispers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He makes his way over.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, draws his sword, and waits by the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check for locks/traps - for each - please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first closed chest is unlocked and un-trapped.  There Dieter finds his clothes and incidentals.  The second chest is locked.  (Sleight of hand or strength to break it.  Or, if you have another idea...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sizes up the chest and tests it’s weight.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Does incidentals mean everything or just some of his stuff like all but weapons/armor in this context?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Everything but the weapons.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tumbler gets caught.  Dieter tugs on the barb he's using and the lock <i>clicks</i> very audibly.  Luckily, or maybe not, at the same exact time, a bellow comes from the other room...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Who the FUCK took my cards!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter slips his ring of invisibility on quickly and feels a deep precious relief come over him. He raises a shushing finger to Frume as he does so and beckons him to stand back against the wall as out of sight as possible.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter vanishes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

As the men breach the hall, you see a lumbering, ugly brute with a heavily pock-marked face and baggy clothes trudge out in front of a weaselly looking guy that has missed a good number of meals.  He's gaunt and his eyes have a seriously haunted look.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a worry, just saw it.)</p><p>The guy had one gold, five silver, and a note of writ, mentioning a ransom for the escaped druid, Dieter Deleter.  The seal of the Runemark is marked in wax at the bottom of the parchment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter’s teeth look a bit like fangs as he snarls at the ransom note. He gives the thief’s corpse a swift kick before leading Frume down the hall. He takes the lead an invisibly scouts out the upcoming turns, listening for any significant movement or sound.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair move W, throwing the door at the end wide.  It was their former cell, the remains of what they could only assume is Culver is strewn about the room.  There is now a hole in the wall where the two escaped from.  The room is covered in blood, but something else seems off, too.  (Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Suppressing a retch, the disoriented Druid turns and beckons onward.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We need to get out of this hell trap. I need air. Did they say this was a castle? perhaps we can find a parapet and repel. Anything to get out of here!”</p>

<p>"Les go back to the main room.  Thought I saw some doors in there.  There might be something across from that chest cell, too.  See about those areas first, I'll be on the lookout for any ladders up."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Upon further investigation, across from the chest cell, a smaller room had the look of just a standard cell.  Hidden in the shadows, a decrepit door stands.  The original room (with the tables and card game) has a door to the S, where you had heard the voices coming from.  (Investigation check for more!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a door across from the cell with the chests in it, a door in the S wall of the trap door room.  (Retconned the direction of that one because of the new map!)</p>

<p>Dieter tries to open the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens to a dark room.  Sparse cobwebs linger in the corners, moldy and tattered hempen bags are scattered on the floor, mostly congregating in the corners.  There is another wooden door on the W side of the room.</p>

<p>On a quick glance, there's nothing there.  Rotted grains, decrepit cloth.  The next door is slightly ajar.  It opens into a strange storage room.  It's narrow and ends in bags of grain piled up to the ceiling.  There is light coming through several open places throughout the makeshift wall, leading you both to believe there is something beyond it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They begin baling the bags over to block up the door they just came in as they try to reveal what’s behind.</p>

<p>It takes a couple hours, the bags are heavier than they look, and the two are tired.  After the majority of them are moved off to the side, an alcove is presented.  Fresher (although not by much) bags and crates of vegetables and barley are packed into the W side of the room.  A handful of dried herbs hangs from the ceiling.  A barrel sits off to the side, a symbol of a boar's head emblazoned on it.  (Perception check, please, for general info.  Investigation for anything specific.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Also, there is a door leading to the E.</p>

<p>Dieter considers the Boar’s Head symbol. Had he seen it somewhere before? He can’t be sure.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The two eat a bit of the fresh food while they take a moment to consider.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(History check on the symbol.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter opens the boar barrel, he happens upon salted pork jerky.  This also seems fairly fresh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There also seems to be a slight breeze coming through the room.  The source might be coming from behind the crates and barrels.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>While chewing on a guilty pleasure, Dieter tries to sniff out the source of the draft. He beckons to Frume to help him move the obstructions about to aid in the search.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Looks like this is from the Dwarves!  Could be them up at Mithril Hall, or maybe up north in Ten-Towns, up Icewind Dale way.  Either way, the Dwarves know their salted meats!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The heavy items are moved out of the way, and a trap door 3ft by 3ft, is at the base of the wall.  It's locked with a hefty padlock.  A dank, fetid smell comes through the rotted knots.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter checks the sturdiness of the door itself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He plies at the wood of the trap door with the edge of a shortsword.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The whole thing just crumbles, the wood is wet and pills in Dieter's hands.  As the wood falls away, red streaks are left on Dieter's fingers.  A furnace blast of decay and iron hit both noses, and bile immediately rises in their throats.  (Con save, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh not this again....)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume turns quickly so the pork doesn't come up, but Dieter... isn't so lucky.  The corner gets splashes while the smell seems to permeate everything.   A snarl comes from the newly uncovered tunnel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Putting the kids to bed, be back in just a few!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume bends down to see if his torch can light up the length of the tunnel at all.  It only goes a few feet in.  Dried blood cakes the inside, giving the tunnel the look like the interior of some infernal beast.  Frume has a kerchief pulled over his nose and mouth, offers another to Dieter.  </p><p>"What say we board this damned portal up?"  A moaning comes from the other end in an ominous answer.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What new devilry...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pulls his blades out and lets out a low growl.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Whoa, friend."  Frume starts looking for things to block up the tunnel.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gathers himself and moves a barrel over on top of the trap.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods and helps him.  "That should do it.  I think."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He runs over to the door and rushes through it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hallway ends 20ft ahead, a small entrance to another room is on the right.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(passed out hard last night. sry)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They bolt down the hallway away from the wretched retch and inspect the next room.</p>

<p>The duo heads down the hall, Frume pausing to slam the door closed.  He rushes after Dieter, the two turn the corner and are greeted with a very interesting sight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mucus looks sickly, and the body is sluggish, the eye stalks droop heavily.  It does not respond to your noise from the hallway.   The shell on it's back shimmers a rainbow of colors, even in the dim light of the room.  Even in it's somewhat emaciated condition, it's huge, and takes up the entire room.  Beyond it, the two adventurers can see another makeshift wall of grain bags.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter studies the <i>beast's</i> form. He draws on his acute learnings of history and nature and melds them with his natural affinity to the amphibious. He feels something wild within him growing. What is the name of this new wonder of the shell?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check, with advantage!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter taps into his druidic nature and comes up with the name "Flail Snail".  He knows that this creature can emit very bright light from it's shell, which it isn't doing at the moment.  The shell also emits an anti-magic shield, and some also have a bit of wild magic imbued.  Some sects of paladins strictly use shields made from the flail snail's shell because of the anti-magic properties it exhibits.  Dieter also gets a sense that this snail might be sick, all the signs point to either extreme exhaustion or illness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check too, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Damn, it's not a beast after all 😛 )</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter feels the pain of this sick snail and searches the room for signs of manipulation and abuse of the poor being.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He assumes a preliminary bedside manner and attempts to show the snail he means no harm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Medicine check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, go grab some of those herbs if you can. This one looks like as much of a captive as us."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks at Dieter.  "You, uh...  You want me to go back... in there?"  He points to the room down the hallway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Now that Frume mentions it, you do hear a kind of scratching coming from down that hallway.  Like nails on wood...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agh, I guess not." He turns back to the sickly snail and tries to catch its eyes, raising his hands in a non-threatening way. He pulls out his water skin and sprays a few ounces down in front of the snail's visage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A little pool of water forms at he snails front, a couple long, droopy stalks find their way to it and lap it up greedily.  A small bit of color comes into the grey flesh of the animal, giving Dieter some hope for it's survival.  From the druid's cursory medical check of the creature, the biggest takeaway is that the animal hasn't eaten for quite some time.  And, upon further inspection of the shell, it feels to Dieter as if some of the anti-magic power is being siphoned off somehow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pulls out a hunk of snake meat from his pack that he hopes has survived well enough for his purpose. He sets it in front of the snail and backs away deferentially.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Guard the rear," Dieter whispers to Frume.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The meat looks blackened and partially rotted.  The snails eye stalks shoot up, stare at the meat, then a maw opens wide from the bottom of the greyish flesh, a wide toothless mouth, and it scarfs the morsel in one bite.  Eyes stalks close as it devours the decaying snake meat.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sounds of heavy pawing at the door behind you can be heard.  The low moan that was heard from the darkened tunnel starts again from the previous room now.  Frume takes a few more steps towards it to investigate.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The smell becomes too much for him and he retreats.  "I'm going to get these bags down, help me cover this doorway with them, aye?"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks back and sees his struggling companion. He takes his remaining three hunks of snake meat and lays them out for the snail before joining and helping barricade the door.</p>

The thing on the other side of the door is going to roll a d20-5.  This is going to be how long it will take the boys to block up the hall vs. the thing to break down it's door.)</p>

<p>The men get to work hauling bag after bag.  Sweat pours from their faces.  Occasionally an eye stalk pokes out and relieves them of their perspiration.  Another bag goes on the top, the clawing from the other side starts to beat frantically on the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall is blocked about three-quarters of the way up.  Dieter hauls another bag over, Frume is just about to heave it atop the pile when <i>bang</i>!  The two hear the door flung wide and crash against the stone wall, probably shattering it to pieces.  A lumbering, unnatural sound comes down the hall.  Frume just finishes throwing the last bag up when a pale appendage comes over the top of the barrier, searching frantically.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stench that follows is beyond nauseating, and the snail even seems affected.  It starts to batter against the bags in front of it, knocking a few out of the way, opening that clearance a bit more.  The appendage that hangs over the barrier is...  odd.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It looks as if...  it was a leg.  But that can't be right, because the end is clearly an arm.  A hand?  But the hand looks odd, too.  Like it has too many digits...</p>

The room beyond the former grain-bag wall is covered in straw, or maybe what remains of an old rug.  There is a lazy brazier in the corner, not doing much to give out heat or warmth.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter checks both doors, opening them quickly and surveying the rooms beyond.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 updated!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The W door opens to another corridor, roughly 35ft long.  It ends in stone double doors to the S, while a wooden door on the W side looks slightly ajar.  The S door opens to another storage room, various sundry items and foodstuff abound.  More of the pork jerky and cheese can be found here, along with eggs, herbs, and a strange box with what looks to be a stylized fish on it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hey Shelli, you still hungry girl?” He proffers the inventory to his new pet, then inspects one of the fish boxes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The box is very well sealed, and a very familiar, fishy aroma greets Dieter when he opens it.  A waxed cloth encloses some of the finest black caviar Dieter has ever seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm, this might trade for a fair penny, if we ever get the chance...” He stows the caviar then eats a few hunks of cheese, forgoing the pork and looking for some mint to settle his stomach.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Not only do you find some hanging peppermint and spearmint, you also find basil, oregano, and a plethora of fancier herbs for cooking and herbalism.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh these will make the road life much more bearable.” He stows a healthy amount then beckons for the duo to follow him down to the stone doors.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume finds a pack and starts stuffing food in, particularly the cheese and pork.  He follows with a piece of jerky hanging out of his mouth.  He tosses a very moldy cheese wheel towards Shelli, who snatches it out of the air.  Her shell shimmers gratefully.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is snarling coming from behind the stone doors.  Ripping and tearing of something as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, there is a MASSIVE <b><i>BOOM</i></b>!  Stone, grain, dust, and other debris rockets out from the door at the N end of the hall, smashing into the wall opposite the door.  An inhuman <i>screech</i> is heard from the former room as flames pour out of the former doorway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume turn to look as a charred abomination clambers out through the newly made hole in the wall.  It walks like a crab or scorpion, smaller appendages in the front, getting bigger the farther up the body they go.  Six appendages in all.  They seem to be an amalgamation of leg and arm bones, ending in a perverse mashup of feet, hands, and claws.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The body, despite being charred, is the torso of a human, but everything is stitched together backwards.  The shoulders and head are at an angle as to let the thing crawl, but still be able to look around at its environment.  Like a scorpion mixed with a centaur, the thing rears up on its hind legs when it sees you and the snail.  To more appendages flick out from it's back, a mixture between a tentacle and a scorpions stinging tail.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What now Frume?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter enters the side room, another strange sight greets him.  For no apparent reason, there is a goblin tent set up in here.  A small, greasy fire is burnt into the stone floor.  Three barrels of foul smelling liquid are seeping through broken slats in the corner, dampening the floor.  Inside the tent, three dead goblins can be seen.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume just stares at Dieter, as if to say, 'What the hell is this?'</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Not sparing a moment, Dieter says, “Help me with these Barrels!” He has Frume help him move the barrels into their growing booby trap in front of the dragon door.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to determine what is in the barrels. “Back up Frume”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume backs up.  Dieter prepares, but just as he's about to make a move, the double doors start opening towards the heroes...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter taps his ring, instinctively going invisible.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume flops into the other room.  The snail stays put.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gets busy uncorking a barrel and seeing whether he can tip it over in time.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The doors swing wide open, banging against the stone walls.  A regal man steps in.  Coarse, curly black hair sits atop a stern looking, young man's face.  Even though he is young, his face is battle-scarred; a long, thin wound, partially healed, carved his face from left temple to right jaw.   He's covered in plate mail that looked hale but battered.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He strides into the room as if he owns the air people breath.  His frown looks ironed on, as if its a permanent fixture.</p>

He sets his flame in the center of the neckband and begins to ritually line up his vials of poison around the outside of the makeshift shrine. He finishes with the Neogi venom at the 12 O’clock position in front of the amulet. </p><p>“Tiamat, take these gifts that our minds might connect.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(SO CLOSE!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Well, at least the religion wasn't a one...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(level up at next LR yeah?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon pops its front paws on the closest upright barrel.  He begins sniffing the air, completely ignoring the makeshift altar.  The huge maw opens, the tongue lolls out.  Dieter notices, now, that this is very close to a baby dragon, maybe a few years old at most.  And it is extremely hungry.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tongue laps at the sharp teeth, the two men back away.  Shelli shakes in her shell.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon turns its head to the remnants of the fire in the other room.  Sniffs again. Then pops down from the barrel and trundles over to Shelli's former prison and starts snacking on what's left of the pantry items.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, slightly embarrassed considering, picks up the altar pieces and stows them back in their various locations. He takes a moment to spread the contents of one of his poison vials over his armaments.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Twas a good idea, lad.  Maybe we can take a look in the cave before we bust outta this place?"</p><p>(Probably best.  If you were to level up and update now, you'd get all your spell slots and such back.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Question about the bladestaff. Could we play it like each end of it is a light weapon allowing for two handed fighting like mechanics for it, so instead of attacking with two short swords, i just take an attack action with one end, then a bonus action to attack with the second? Limit both to 1-handed damage?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I dig that, sure!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Nice, feels good to make that change at the level up too, like he has mastered the weapon that much more.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>Combat ended.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The experience with the dragon and Shelli have struck a chord deep in the spirit of the developing Druid. He feels the pull back to the coast embodied by Shelli, whose amphibious nature and steadfast presence remind him of the sea and of home. The dragon, the fleeting, yet acquiescent power, the stoic serpentine stature, key him into the deep mystery at play here and the opaque stakes, the depths of which he is sure he has not even begun to plumb. </p><p></p><p>Dieter leads away into a quiet corner and beckons the Bandersnatch to stand guard a moment while he recovers himself and meditates on all that is new.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Sure, no problem lad."  Frume splits his attention between the seemingly illusory goblin tent and the hallway from whence the small battalion just came.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok, I'm all leveled. This does not count as a long rest though, right?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Short rest if you're just meditating.  If you want to take a long rest, you should probably find more stable ground.  The Captain's probably not knocked out for long...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ok, but from leveling i'd at least get my spell slots and hp right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was thinking about prepping new spells too, but think that might only be after LR as well. I do at least get one new  spell to prepare, but just wanted your ruling on how that works here)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Usually you can't use any of the new spell slots or spells unless you prepare them and have the spell slots for them.  It's getting on a pretty full day.  Let's see if you, Frume, and Shelli can get to a 'save point'!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool cool)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's move! I need more time to do this properly. Frume, take the rearguard, Shelli, well...follow as quickly as you can!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leads them through the room of Dragon carnage and stops short to take a closer look at the place now the dragon has moved on.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Everyone, get in here and let's bar these doors."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume begins to do so, ushering Shelli in as fast as they both can.  Besides the skeleton-cide that happened in here, it looks like it was once nicely furnished as a trophy room.  Various stuffed animal heads, including a small red dragon, are mounted on the stone walls.  Interesting creatures abound in here.  You also take notice, through every room you've passed, you haven't seen any windows...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around for any valuables, then asks of Frume, "Just how did you disappear with the Captain? And what of that strange Goblin hut?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a door, stone, on the E wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter meanders over to the Red Dragon head to give it a thorough inspection.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah, now that's a story!  So, I'm running into the room, really I was falling into it, trying to get away from whatever was coming through those doors.  Thought I would hide in the goblin's tent and surprise him, like.  Only, when I take a step in, there are these stairs, and everything is pitch black.   I stumble a bit, fall, catch meself on the dirt floor, a few feet down.  I'm totally thrown but I have enough wits about me to get the hell outta the way, in case something else comes clambering down like I did.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, as I move off the dirt path, I see the oval shapes all around me.  Black upon black they were, almost couldn't make 'em out.  My torch went kaput, so I had to feel my way around.  These things were hot to the touch, so I put two an two together, came up with four, and realized they were dragons eggs!  Then this big bloke comes in, searching for something.  Snuck up and gave him a whack on the back o' the noggin.  Then I ran out as fast as I could.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If you ask me, looks like they're making a dragon army with all those eggs in there.  Or feeding something humongous."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"By the breath of the sea mother...A DRAGON ARMY?!?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"This bears careful thought. Did you get a sense of...how heavy those eggs are? How long do you think he'll be out?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, maybe?  Who knows what these... crazies do or why.  I bet he'll be out for a few minutes, but frankly he could be coming too any minute.  The door's shut, if we can wedge it closed somehow, that should buy us some more time."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed...though I hate to think what foul deeds might become of those dragon eggs one way or another. Do we not have a responsibility to do something about it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Though, might better to get out alive and maybe do aught on the other side of the wall as well..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter grimaces, but steels his mind. "Right. We flee East."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Before he turns, he looks back to the Red Dragon and considers taking a little memento.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume takes an antelope head from the wall and wedges it under the doors.  The scraping grates on the ear.</p><p>The mounted dragon head is bulky and, in all sense of taste and class, abhorrent.  The look it's giving, the size of it, the actual taxidermy...  Not well done at all.  But it could work as a memento or a specific buyer might pay a good sum for it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I am in seventh heaven right now!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, is looking at the horns and teeth, presumably the eyes have been replaced by something or other as surely a Dragons real eyes would not sustain in this way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door E grates on the stone floor, crumbling pebbles acting as pumice to the floor beneath.  The heroes look through and see a long room, bedecked with gadrooned columns and torches lit irregularly on the rough stone walls.  There is an air to this room, a somber, creepy feel.  A breeze blows through, rustling tapestries attached to several columns.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The floor also tracks downward toward the end of the hall approximately 60 feet away, dropping in all about 15 feet.  There are three doors on that end of the room, one on each side, W, S, and E.  There is something carved in them, but you can't tell from this vantage point.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ffs)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>From the far end of the room, Dieter can tell there are four separate banners.  All different colors, they look to have different insignias on them as well.  The doors, although still hard to make out, have an odd type of lock on them, which is what is carved into them.  There are no handles on the W and S doors, but the door to the E has one.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You also hear the wind stir, but you can't make out what's creating the draft.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Taking what he can of the dragon bone, Dieter hurries the crew into the East room. Ever cautious, they close the large doors behind them again. He works with Frume to closer identify the insignias and lock patterns on each door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You take the mounted dragon apart?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Trying to pry out its teeth and horns as crafting components.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Athletics check with adv, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter starts dissecting this mounted dragon, it falls apart in his hands.  The skin, brittle as paper, flakes away.  The musculature wasn't treated properly and turns to dust in his hands.  The teeth and horns, however, and decently intact.  You get two horns and ten teeth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(History check on the tapestries, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(thaaaaanks 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
You both bounce ideas off each other on what they could be.  The first one is black and gold, a picture of a wyvern or dragon falling:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The second is a beautiful dark purple, on which a set of eyes is emblazoned on a crest above talons:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The third is a blackish purple background, the foreground is a strange diamond crest.  It looks to be made of gold, with silver waves cresting the middle:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The last is a pure black tapestry, and it is threadbare and hanging on by a prayer.  The image can just be seen:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first is a symbol of the Zhentarim, a cabal of merchants, thugs, and assassins bent on cornering every market and town for themselves.  They have no scruples and care for nothing save money and power.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The second is the mark of the Cult of the Dragon.  There are many off-shoots, but this is  the main symbol created by lich Sammaster.  Their ultimate goal is to raise the dragons and dragon-kin to their rightful place in the world - above all.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The third is the mark of the Arcane Brotherhood.  Frume pipes in about this one, as he mentions he has dealings with the city of Luskan<s>, or which it is now known as, the City of Anarchy.</s>  They are a fringe society, but what they lack in notoriety, they make up for in pure ambition and magical prowess.  There are a set number of seats in the brotherhood, one has to die in order for another to be raised into the sect.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The last...  eludes even Frume.  He scratches his head.  "Looks like a death cult of some kind, but I'm damned if I know.  You feel that chill, by the way?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Follow the air. It will guide us out." <i>I hope...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter goes over to the East door and checks the handle while feeling around for the draft.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Feeling a draconic irony overcome him, Dieter hands Frume a bottle of Gold Dragon Ale and pulls one for himself as well. His third and final, he proffers to Shelli, seeking any sign of interest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Animal handling check!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The snail sticks her... nose (?) up at the brew, but Frume taps your bottle and says, "Fucking cheers to that!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
***Gold Draconic Ale**: Infused with cinnamon, little gold flakes can be seen floating within. Causes the drinker to belch small harmless flames for the next 5 minutes.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The E door is closed, but not locked.  The carvings read oddly, a few have been scratched away.  Frume meanders to the S door, burping small flames every now and again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Whatcha make of these carvings, Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stows the third ale, knowing what it does now, he hopes to see the look on Maouelue's face when he gets the chance to quaff this last.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He traipses over to Frume all the while keeping a nose out for the source of the wind.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Druid's eyes flick back and forth over the distressed carvings.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The breeze feels like it's coming from different directions at different times.  (Arcana check for the doors, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's tough because these look like they're legible, but the language is either very ancient, or set up to trick your eyes when you read it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter turns back to his search for the wind. He produces a flame to help guide him in the direction of the draft, watching as the flames are pushed this way and that.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The flame in his hand flutters, dives.  Corrects and becomes still.  Then violently wavers again.  It becomes like bubbling, boiling water.  It grows in size, double, now treble the size it once was.  In shadows above, gliding down, is a shadow spectre, wrapped in grey smoke and floating down directly at the druid!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter releases the flame and steps backward, assessing his options.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>With what time he has, he takes note of the spectre’s shape and form trying to perceive its alignment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's ethereal, swathed in smoke.  It is not being aggressive, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Greetings, dark spirit.” Dieter coughs in his best abyssal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The smoke roils and expands.  A hoarse scream comes from the center of the entity.  Dieter looks and Frume and the spectre are holding their heads in their hands.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume hits the floor, a line of blood running from his nose.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The spectre stays hovering, but is backed further away.  There is a soft blue light illuminating the smoke now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Dieter slowly approaches the light making no vocalization. He walks steadily and reaches out for the blue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is feeling the dark pull. The thirst for knowledge. The thirst for the power to drive his own destiny....</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes a deep breath of smoke.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid is engulfed in smoke.  Frume gasps and reaches out for his friend, but his hand encloses on nothing.  Dieter is transformed...  And the two beings.  Vanish.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few minutes later, Daran creeps back into the area looking frustrated.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(making sure he hasn’t taken it)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Who hasn't taken it?  Daran?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What did you spy there Daran.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah in case i needed to make us invisible etc)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Not a damn thing.  Which worries me."  To the woman, "Who is after you?  Or is it the letter someone is after?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Messenger: "I don't know why someone would be after me!  The letter was given to me with a dire urgency to deliver it.  I've been making haste to Oakhurst.  The bolt hit me and I fell off my horse, who bolted farther down the path.  It was rented, so it'll probably go back to it's owner, I don't suppose I'll be able to even retrieve my gear less I go back."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We will deliver this message with all haste. May we lead the pursuant away.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, we must hurry!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If we leave this woman, and she doesn't have the letter, she dies.  Do you have anything that can help her?  Or magics that can spirit her away?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue places the amulet of health around the maid’s neck and whispers a prayer to the lord to send forth its healing and to aid them in their mission.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods, following Ouelue's direction.  He roots around in his pack, pulls out a strip of leather that could be a belt or strap.  "Put this in your mouth and bite down," he tells her.  She does, and he grips the bolt.  "Why don't you try to pull that out one more time, this time you'll have my help."  He braces the leg and the woman, motioning Ouelue to remove the barb.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Ouelue lends all her empathy into feeling how the bolt is lodged and reaches out with her feelings...</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The bolt pops out of the messengers leg, she moans, but Daran quickly staunches the blood and casts:

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
"Sorry, lady.  Not much extra help, I'm afraid, but enough to get you on your feet."  He pulls out a cloak from his pack, drapes it around the woman, and helps her up.  Lastly, as he walks the group to the main road, he casts:

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"This should work, but let us keep to the edge of the road, and let us move quickly."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ready to run?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let’s make for Oakhurst in a hurry.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Might be ridiculous, but let's say you're about three hours out.  Let's both roll 3 stealth checks - remember to add the +10.  At DC 10 there'll be something bad, but other than that, all three should be able to get there fine.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(FYI, for that format, !c stealth -rr 3 -dc 10)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crew travels lightly, all three moving with amazing stealth and precision.  Only once does Daran think he sees something following them, and backtracks a bit.  After a few minutes, he rejoins the group and pushes them on.  As the clouds open up, the trio emerges from a group of trees and the village of Oakhurst is visible on the horizon.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to pause there for tonight, but I have to work tomorrow so I can pick it up early.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(good good! good to be back in full swing!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hell yes!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A wave of emotion overcomes Ouelue as (s)he sees the town for the first time in what feels like weeks underground. Anxious to determine Dieter’s dilemma, (s)he pushes forth with haste.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage enters a surreal town, one he knows and doesn't at the same time.  Burned buildings, few children and families are in the streets.  The dead lay with rain pattering them, only those they left behind to carry them to their graves.  </p><p></p><p>There are a handful of buildings still upright and somewhat intact.  The inn, the tavern, a few homes, Vam's ranch...   These all, at least from first glance, seem okay.  The three enter the crossroads proper and scan in all directions.  The Runemark's men didn't raze everything, but the town is still only a shell of it's former self.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stands speechless. he cannot fathom what kind of evil soul would do such a thing. </p><p>“Those bastards will pay for this...”</p><p>He leads the group onward toward the ranch, hoping to get a word in with Vam and potentially Heston before heading into the wreckage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group turns W, led by Ouelue, they see a rough-and-tumble man, early thirties, dusty blonde hair tied into a tight bun at the back of his head, stubble darkening his weather-beaten face.  He leads a big brown gelding NW through the town.  He wears normal rancher's clothes, but atop them, a set of emerald green snakeskin chaps, a vest, and bracers indicate him as Heston, the tailor/ranch-hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"That's a fine bit of snakeskin work there...Reminds me of a time I loaned out summat around these parts."</p><p>Ouelue winks meaningfully at Heston. </p><p>"I have desire to speak to Vam and hit Leatherworker as well. We bring tidings from the Manor..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranch-hand gives the group a strange, suspicious look.  "Aye, head over yon.  Vam's a bit beat up, but he'll see ya.  It's a bad time to be comin' inta town, just to let y'all know.  I'd be headin' out as soon as ye can.  Just some friendly advice."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman grabs Ouelue by the arm.  "Excuse me, miss.  If I could have that letter back, I must deliver it right away to the Pig and Falcon.  I appreciate all your help.  Both of you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes yes, of course. Here. And your pin as well.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue waits for her to be out of earshot, then leans closer to Heston.</p><p>He whispers,</p><p>“It is I...Maouelue. Prithee take a moment to catch me up with Vam...”</p><p>“...That is some fine snakeskin.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman nods, and leaves quickly, making for the tavern.  Looking at it, the Pig and Falcon is surprisingly free of burn marks...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston does a double take, then looks Ouelue deep in her eyes.  He drops the reins and gives the mage a hug, saying, "I knew you'd come back.  The others...  they said you'd abandoned us to those monsters, but Vam and I...  we'd knew you'd come back to help."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue surprises himself with how passionately he returns the embrace. He is <i>relieved</i> to be back in town regardless of its state. There are wrongs here that need to be righted, and the return of Heston to his sight instills the vigor of purpose and direction.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, this is my good man Heston. He is a friend in this. Come Heston, let us away with these tidings to Vam.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A bit embarrassed, but still a hardened cattle-man, breaks away from Maouelue/Ouelue.  He then shakes the rangers hand.  Surprisingly it is Daran that looks sheepish.  (Insight check for more!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man reminds Daran of someone. Mao can tell that, but no more.</p><p>Heston motions the two to follow him.  They head towards the ranch, which looks very battered indeed.  The farmland around it has been burned, part of the horse barn is collapsed, most of it has black soot marks all over.  The street in front still show the cracks from the serpent attacks.  The trio move quickly up the front steps and into the small ranch.  Heston waves at a couple women doing chores in the main room.  He leads the ranger and the druid to the back room on the first floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Opening the door slowly, quietly, he shows the others Vam.  Lying still in a bed, thin covers down to his waist, the man is bandaged over most of the top of his body.  Wet cloths hide the misery and pain beneath.  The skin that is visible is red, raw.  Vam is looking out the window opposite the group that just entered.  He doesn't turn his head when he says, "Knew you'd come.  Heston wouldn't've brought anyone else in here."  He turns his head to look at the trio.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Half of his face is covered in red, splotchy bandages.  The other side is wet with perspiration.  The black skin is cracked, distressed.  Like his eyes.  He tries to make sense of what he's seeing; a woman, an elf, and Heston.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Forgive my glamour, it is I, Maouleue. My poor soul, what has happened here?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Cleric Mage immediately falls to his knees aside the flayed man and begins praying with bowed head and radiant spirit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His eye becomes calmer, more... hopeful.  He beckons Maouelue in.  He tries to reach for the woman's shoulder, to comfort her, but is too weak to even find it.  After a few flailing attempts, his arm flops down and he takes a shuddering sigh.  His voice comes out as smoke and gravel.  "I appreciate you coming back.   But you shouldn't have.  The glamour is a good idea.  They came looking for you.  Pretty much right after you took off for those snakes."  He coughs.  "Seems like ten years ago, now.  Damn.  They came in the middle of the night, fires blazing.  Took down pretty much everyone.  Dragged the rest away.  Put a few to the question, then lit 'em up in the middle of town.  Like a fuckin' funeral pyre."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He coughs again, it wracks his body and he double over, causing more spasms.  Daran heads to the other side of him and commences with his magics.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Nine Devils.....I will suffer their filth  <i>NO LONGER!</i>”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam's body rises above the bed, then the spells his.  Immediately, the coughing abates.  The three watch as skin knits together.  Red welts of burn damage close.  The man takes a deeper breath, then starts to laugh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You boys treat me too well, you know that.  By the gods, I'm tired."  He chuckles again and settles back in the bed.  "Shit was horrible before you go blaming yourself.  Three of the council being Muhlen's, no one knowing a damned thing about it...  Yeah, shit was done before you broke it open.  Hell, if you boys hadn't, we probably would have still be tripping along to their merry little melody.  This town owes you a debt it won't be able to fulfil.  Maybe that's what happened here.  The fates taking theirs."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shifts to look at Maouelue.  "Either way, they're looking for you and unless you've got an army behind you, I'd say steer clear.  At least for the time being."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A woman's voice comes softly from the doorway.  "Were my ministrations too rigorous for you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue raises an eye at the intrusion and puts on an air of welcome into the clerical fold, while remaining vigilant under the mask and taking in every inch of the newcomer.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A raven-haired woman stands meekly in the doorway.  Bits of dirt and moss slightly mar her stark white skin.  She is a beauty to behold, though.  Bellatrix's head is bowed at the woman before her, waiting for either a reprimand on her work, or to be run out of town.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bellatrix! Do mine eyes deceive me?!...Alas, I’ve made sure yours do you! My dear, fellow healer, please ignore my glamorous appearance. It is I, Maouleue. I am here to finish what I no doubt didn’t start, but sure as hell raked up!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Maouelue?!  Well, that is good news!"  She goes to shake, but decides to curtsy instead.  "And this must be Dieter, welcome back goodsirs."  She curtsies again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(dinner afk)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Ouelue chuckles.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah no, hehe...yes, I suppose that one’s on me. This here is my acquaintance and well, savior of a sort, Daran. He has shown me good faith and broken bread with me of his own accord. He helped me in a time of great need as did you that one...fateful day...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, meet Bellatrix, a healer, friend, and if I dare say, a longer sufferer of these machinations than myself. Heston and Vam can vouch as well.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But pardon the pleasantries, pray can we pull up by the hearth and take on some warm vittles? We need to make a plan and fast. We would have news of what moves in these parts, if you can give them.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranger stands and folds his arm across his chest, bows to the woman.  Bellatrix is taken aback for a moment by the show of chivalry, then smiles at Ouelue.  "Handsome <i>and</i> good with formalities.  I'm impressed with the company you keep, good wizard."  She curtsies back to Daran.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam sits up, waves a hand to say he's okay to do so, and starts to rise.  "Let's head to the fire.  I'd like some... vittles, too."  He smirks at Ouelue.  Softly, to the wizard, he says, "Pardon me saying, you make a comely lass, friend."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hah! You should have known him when his name was Truth-or-Daran!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Aye, and I make a lassie come!</i>” <i>He winks privately to Vam.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam busts out laughing.  He puts an arm around Ouelue, partially to help lead him out, partially because he might fall over for laughing too hard.  Daran, almost imperceptibly, blushes and follows the group out, careful to make sure everyone goes before him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The discipline of Bahamut is one of Life after all. And what’s more lively than making more life?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Bahamut's been known to sew some seeds every now and again...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No Sow. No Reap.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(damn messed it up lol)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I liked 'now sow'!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The fire crackles as the five sit around it.  The two women helpers get Vam comfortable and Heston brings bowls of thick venison stew and fresh bread.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ma)ouelue is in high spirits right now, not jubilant, but excited, envigorated with purpose and comradely. (S)he gathers everyone around the hearth and begins to speak to the group in a dramatic and hushed whisper. Speech becomes a song of love and devotion. A condemnation for the masses who have, for honesty, been asked for apology by those who enjoy the silence. Those who wear guilt like shackles on their feet. A halo in reverse.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(S)he proffers a blank page of her spellbook-cum-tome of faith.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here, I stand, with the book in my hand, truth on my side. I will not substitute blindness for kindness. If anyone can smell a lie, let the accusations fly, but time after time I feel elation...hiiiigh...at the personal faith that I can feel reach out from each of you. Never again is what we swore the time before this madness happened again. Let us not be hos to these pimpfs! Reach out! Touch faith! Arise warriors of the light!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>(Ma)ouelue’s transformation has elicited a sped-up style.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They all are on fire with the words.  Heston is physically on the edge of his seat, legs bouncing in anticipation of a fight.  Daran, calmer, shows it in his eyes.  Although outwardly calm and resolute, Ouelue sees a spark in the elf's eyes that probably hasn't been there for quite some time.  Vam is impressed, too, but he is more subdued.  Their host sits forward and wipes his mouth with a checked cloth.  "Those are some powerful, powerful words.  And we are all proud and excited to be behind you and yours, friend.  The thing is...  we just don't have the numbers.  Not here, at least.  The way I see it, we can call these fuckers out, storm the castle, ride in on white steeds, the whole fucking deal.  But they've got things I've only seen in my nightmares.  And by the wagon load, to boot.  Might be best to take the word on the road, see what help we can drum up in, say, Neverwinter?  Or even Waterdeep?  Hell, Silverymoon might even have a hundred strong to ride with us, wipe the shits out in one go?  Unless you have a different idea already?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We’ve a man on the inside.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam studies the wizards face for a long moment.  The others look tensely at each other.  Vam says, "Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. He is within.” (S)he looks long in Vam’s eyes. </p><p>“How many are loyal to us in Oakhurst?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He swallows, wipes his mouth again, shakes his head.  "I don't think you understand, son.  There is no more Oakhurst."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm gonna pause there, seems like a fun place to stop!  You have a good evening sir!  I'm home all day tomorrow, we can rev it up any time!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Kirra, Denson, Saynea?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(GGz! Always a pleasure)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Always, sir.  I appreciate you sticking around for my crazy ramblings!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Having a blast. Fun to write in a free low-stakes yet deep way. Great to just have the imagination flowing.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Surely they are not <i>all</i> gone!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam lowers his eyes, looking simultaneously very sad and very old.  "I didn't see what happened to Kirra.  Denson fell.  Saynea was taken back to their camp, wherever that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Only two buildings are fully intact from the burnings - the tavern and the shrine."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ilmater...I wonder what became of the healer.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry dude, got a bit sidetracked tonight.  Pick it up again tomorrow morning?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no prob!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't know that I ever saw what happened to her in all the craziness.  Just noticed the place was untouched.  Must have suffered enough, eh?"  He chuckles, somberly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell you what, though... if I get another round of healing, I might be able to walk through what's left with you, see what we're working with?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye Vam. All together now?” He looks at the other two healers in the eyes.</p>

<p>Maouelue and Daran hover around the man, while Bellatrix kneels at his feet.  They all lay hands and a golden glow surrounds Vam.  As the glow fades, the two women helpers gasp as a whole and hale Vam stands amidst his co-horts.</p><p>He looks at his arms and body.  Then he removes the bandage from his face.  Scars are still there, creasing his dark brown skin.  And the eye is still cloudy, not fully healed.  Maybe it never will be.  But the man standing in front of Ouelue and Daran smiles.</p><p>"Now...  well, then."  Wetness lines the bottom of his eyes as he looks to his friends with pure thanks.  "Much obliged.  All of you.  Thank you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Vam...I am only repaying a debt that was already owed. You helped me and my <i>missing</i> friend Dieter in a time of need. We formed an alliance that day, and <i>one that I aim to keep alive!</i>"</p>

<p>"Who here will swear fealty to the cause of righteousness and the pursuit of a new valor in these lands!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston steps forward, but then looks awkward.  "I... uh...  I will.  I don't have any weapons or anything.  Not sure how exactly to swear fealty.  But I'm with you guys!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"As am I," says Vam, smiling at the young ranch-hand.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I believe your cause is just, wizard.  As long as you will have me by your sides, I will fight."  Bellatrix's eyes sheen over quickly with a green flash.</p>

<p>The elf's illusion fades as he sits there in the warmth of the ranch. He comes out of his short reverie and walks out the back door and over to the nearest paddock, seeing what has become of the animals under Vam's care.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He cast his gaze around for Vam as he strolls over the lands, hoping to have a private word.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The lands are sparse now.  The rain has abated enough to show a muddy tract of land devoid of crops, a strange sight to be sure as last you saw it was flush and growing well.   Vam and Heston are in the barn's hayloft, you heard some muffled noises and talking.  There are couple horses, one of which you do recognize as the one Dieter took along on the start of the trek.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The elven reverie has tempered some of the flame that had run so hot at the past meeting and Maouelue pauses at the door to the barn and knocks on the doorframe deferentially.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I beg your pardon, friends."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I came to check on the horses. I see one of those you lent us has returned...what news of its mate?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam peeks his head down.  "Unfortunately only this one came back.  Heston's got something interesting up here, if you want to check it out.  Not sure what to make of it, but you might."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. A thousand apologies for the loss. She was a good steed for her part. We did not...intend to be underground so long..."</p>

<p><i>Maouelue ascends into the hayloft to investigate.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, don't worry about it," he offers you a hand up to the loft.  "Most of the horses we have here are wild, or were at one point.  Heston here is a wizard with calming them, tempering them for farm work.  Other things happening right now, though."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the Dragon Mage steps up into the loft, he sees Heston sitting on a small stool next to an old chest.  Vam follows over and says, "Hes says it's an old family heirloom.  Haven't seen any heirloom like this, though.  What do you make of it?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston holds out a shaped, twisted piece of metal.  Long cylinders connect and protrude from a steel body.  The end curves down into a handle of sorts, on which some sort of bone or horn has been layered.  Heston says, "Was my pa's.  Only ever seen him use it once.  He gave me the name of a guy that can help fix it, if I ever needed it, but he's way out in the North territories.  Never ha much use for it.  Until now, that is."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed this is an interesting trinket."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He undoes a clasp, and a wide cylinder ops out.  It spins easily, showing chambers around the main cylinder.  Six, exactly.  "Pa taught me how to keep it oiled.  It sends these things whizzing like you wouldn't believe!"  He holds out rounded, tube-like projectiles, similar to elongated versions of Maouelue's frosted balls.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Think it'll help?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Keep that thing steady there lad."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches out for one of the projectiles, "...er, may I?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston readily hands Maouelue all of the items.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the cylindrical item and the elongated metal items. He chuckles mildly, thinking of the look on Dieter's face the first time he saw the new metal-clad zealous look. A mixture of dumbstruck horror and awe and confusion all grappling with the sense of camaraderie. The muscular contortions on the already shape-shifted visage were such as pleasant plethora of hilarity.</p><p></p><p>Here, holding this new metal monstrosity in his hands, he feels a pang of guilt holding the item and so sets it down carefully. He turns a professional eye to it instead, taking in its design and metalworkings.</p><p></p><p>"Was this everything in that chest there?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Just some family memories.  Clothes and mementos.  But I thought I could carry that, in case it might come in handy.  Hate to be unarmed, and I'm really no good with swords or bows," says Heston.  Vam chuckles, starts down the ladder.  "Well, as long as we're getting things together, I think I'll run by the iron works, see what's salvageable."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You take good care of that weapon Heston, and if you need company up North some day, I'll see it done."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage lays a warm hand on Heston's right shoulder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a few, presentation.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The lord of life and light guide your aim freind."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I have a meeting at 12 as well.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also, didn't even notice this yesterday! )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The Warlock's Crypt!  Perfect!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston looks up at the wizard, beaming.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Now, tell me, whatever came of the <i>rest</i> of those serpentine reagents we gave you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Was there enough left over for the pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I do so desperately want to to deliver them to dieter and don't dare disappoint."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston guffaws as only a cowboy can.  "Sure, absolutely!  Forgot all about them in the commotion.  See here," and he takes you down the ladder into a corner of the barn set up as a makeshift tannery.  They are all as you requested, all fit to size.  They're extremely supple, too.  The craftsmanship is really top notch.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah perfect, Dieter'll love these. He's been jealous of my hat, armor, and bracers since the vault to be honest..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Won't say nothin' about it mind, but I see him sneaking glances."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"But...I might just keep the hat..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston says, "Now, here's something I though would be handy."  He shows off the bracers, saying, "There's a small area here for a dagger or small knife, but when there's nothing in there, because of the scales, it's seamless."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye, indeed! My man Dieter will find that <i>most</i> intriguing, if I've been following his passions precisely of late!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you for the beautiful work. We set up a bit of a forge ourselves down under as a matter of fact. If we get out the other side of this, might be we should make a bit of a go at it, after we learn a bit more up in the Northern reaches that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He pats your shoulder.  "If we get through what's next, just might hold you to that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage returns a wry smile and a few crow's feet crinkle in the corner of his starry eyes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Alright now, let's round up the crew and hit the road. What say we ready a few steeds for our needs?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'll get right on that.  Four gonna work?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's bring five. Just in case Dieter is in rougher shape than we might expect. Reckon we could keep a fifth in tow?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks around at the stables, scratching his chin.  "Lemme see what I can round up.  Meet you back here in a few."  He makes haste out of the barn.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a beat and looks around at one of the last remnants of the Oakhurst he was just beginning to know and love. Here where they held that fateful council...What a mess! What impetuous hubris. The dark currents run deep and they are not easily displaced. One would do well to remember this going forward.</p><p></p><p>He makes for the main building and comes into Bellatrix's view checking on her reverie.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "How fare ye, goodsir wizard?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well, let's just say I've got a fancy new hat!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He trades the Frostbitten Helm for the supplely-scaled, pointed had.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Our steeds arrive and we are off to put this dread pattern right!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Turning from the fire, she gives the wizard a deep look.  Without knowing her, some would say it was a dark, foreboding gesture.  Knowing who she is... it might still be foreboding, but Maouelue knows it as a introspective look.  She purses her lips, goes into her pack.  "Would you allow me an... insight?  Into our upcoming venture?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue slows his gusto replies reverently, “Of course, anything.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What would you ask of me?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Often people are scared of that which they cannot see, hear, physically interact with.  You and I know, however, that there is a weave to the world that is unseen, yet bonds everything together.  There are ways to manipulate this weave.  But for every action, there is a reaction.  Every now and again, I like to try and see the eventuality of those actions and reactions.  I give you the choice - rune, card, or dice?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Rune.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>h!rune</p>

<h3>Helios – Helios</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mysterious woman smirks a little at the choice.  She reaches into her pack, closes her eyes, rummages more.  Then, slowly, she brings her closed fist out of the bag.  </p><p>"Runes help us connect with the elements.  They are an intimate connection to our inner being.  My runes have been with me for a very long time, since I was a child.  The longer you have a connection with them, and the closer they are to the body in that time, the more accurate they can be."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With that, she opens her hand.  The rune that looks back at you is carved into smooth, sanded bone.  The carved section is black, contrasting greatly against the bleached white of the bone.  Bellatrix's smile fades as she looks at the symbol.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“This symbol is out of balance.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She peers at you and squints. "You've recently found a new deity.   But that deity has some connection to the horrors you've faced.  Even with the heightened piety, or maybe because of it, you are more of a target than ever before.  Not just by the forces you seek out.  Things move in the shadows, to compel you off of your path.  Or maybe onto the correct one?  Maouelue, be wary of going farther away or closer to your patron.  You are on a shield balanced atop a sword.  One slight move any way might plunge you into chaos."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue listens to the words and stares at the symbol as if in a trance. He moves his right hand over the top of the rune and pulls his water skin out with his left. He pours a few drops into the weave his other hand is making above the rune and thin, beaded arcs of water begin to form. The arcs spiral and conform into a column of circles, spinning about a vertical axis. The wizard’s left hand stows the skin and comes over top of the cylinder, pressing downward and spinning counterclockwise. Six beaded rings of water spread out around a central one, mimicking the pattern of the rune below. This form hovers for a few moments and Maouelue’s hands come to a rest. He speaks an elven word and a spire begins to coalesce out of the vapors surrounding the sigil. At first it appears to run across the depth of the pattern, but then turns and reveals the three spread legs from below, now making a facsimile of the rune. Hovering there for a moment, another word is uttered and the spindle-legged stalk begins to tilt vertically making a three dimensional spire held by a tripod of feet. The feet connect at the alternating intersections of the inner circle with the outer.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue’s eyes shine bright blue. It almost seems as if the Light comes from behind him and through him into the watery symbol as a cold radiance comes and freezes the re-balanced rune in place. He raises his gaze toward Bellatrix and sets the structure atop her heirloom rune.</p><p></p><p>“We must approach the old conflict with new dimensions, if we are to find balance.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You still have inspiration die, correct?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Belltrix's smile returns as Maouelue reinterprets her reading.  "Wisdom is often found throughout dimensions.  If one can only see what needs to be seen when they need to see it."</p>

<p>Maouelue holds Trix’s gaze awhile then nods and gestures onward. “If we are to regain our balance, we must indeed establish our pillars in the area. Let us find Vam and Heston and discuss our strategy.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods, gets up from the fireplace to watch out the window.  The rain has stopped, an eerie fog has set upon the town.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kiddo bed. will post up soon.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stays his advance and turns to regard the scene with Trix. “A dire scape to be certain... but come now, we will make our own omens on the road.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her lips purse.  She waits for Maouelue to lead the way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads out through the moist land to the edge of the paddock to meet with the rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mist slowly rises all around like steam from a lake.  It gives the world an ominous feel.  Dark clouds above, still threatening a downpour, mixed with the haze sets a macabre scene.  A howl can be heard in the distant forest.  Vam and Heston are in the barn, saddling and settling the horses.  Vam waves to the two of you as you enter.  Daran is walking around, inspecting the horses, whispering to them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ho there. Many thanks for the horses and bridling. My friends, we must make haste to our next destination, yet we must be firm in our conviction. The forces that move, as Vam said, are vile, powerful, and far reaching. We would do well to set up a network around the Neverwinter. I have seen a spire of three converging and ascending upwards, an omen that I take at this moment as a guide to our cause. Let us create a network across Neverwinter, Longsaddle, and Luskan. We will seek information in subtle ways throughout these towns. Lie low and strengthen our position. There is no telling where Dieter may be at this moment. I know this in my heart now. I must not let zeal overtake clarity of mind. Pray, what would each of you say to this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The four look between themselves.  They seem to be testing the waters, see who is going to take over the second-in-command role, all seemingly deferring to each other.  Vam nods, looks at Heston.  Heston nods, looks between Vam and the others.  Daran looks pensive.  Bellatrix turns her keen eye to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What you say is very wise.  The two towns of Longsaddle and Neverwinter will have sympathetic ears.  Luskan, I fear...  That might be war on a second front we do not have the ability for.  It all depends on our quarry.  If it be Dieter, then I offer to scry to locate him.  If our goal is to garner troops and wage battle on the Runemark's men, then cavalry is needed.  We can do both, but then delegation is the key."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What contacts have you men in any of the nearby towns? Do we have any friends or advantages in Longsaddle? If what you say about Luskan is true, then it's either East and South, or make our way through the North Neverwinter Wood and head for the coast."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When you mention Neverwinter Woods, you see Daran get very uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(No worries, enjoy the jam!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks uncomfortable when the Wood is mentioned.   He involuntarily clutches at a chain around his chest and takes a step backwards.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston shrugs.  "I don't really have any contacts or anything.  Especially nearby.  I can ride and check in with the powers-that-be in Longsaddle, though.  Been there a handful of times."</p><p>Vam says, "I have a few merchant contacts in both places.  I can take whomever to check into what either can help with."</p><p>Bellatrix just puts her head down and shakes it.</p><p>Daran, speaking softly, says, "Neverwinter Woods is my home.  I can ensure anyone who travels through will be safe."</p>

<p>Maouelue eyes the half-elf for a long beat. “Thank you Daran. Is there aught else you would tell us about the Wood? What of your people there?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks at the ground for a few beats, the awkward silence growing.  Finally he looks up, directly into Maouelue's eyes, and says, "None of my people there any longer.  There are... places we should avoid, and I can help you with that.  The safest route is around, but if there is a need to go through, I can help.  All manners of things are drawn to the woods."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...I am sorry dear Daran. I can see there is great pain this causes you. I will pry no further.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I think we would do well not to fracture our fellowship into too many groups. I am of a mind to have those that would go to Longsaddle establish a foothold in the community. I shall lead a party into Neverwinter. I will not ask any of you to brave this with me, but would welcome any support may it be forthcoming.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, there may not be need to delve too far into the Forest, but I would appreciate its cover rather than the suspicion and exposure of the road. I will follow your lead in your domain.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods.  But you can tell he's still holding something back.   The rest of the group seem bolstered by the fact they won't be individually left alone on a task.  Welcoming the challenge, Van says, "I can take Heston with me to Longsaddle.  We can round up some folks and then meet back here?  Or I can just ride with them to Neverwinter and we can march from there, too.  Your call, Mao."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(nice!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Good, good. I would have you stay in Longsaddle for the time being. If you are able, send word ahead to anyone who may be friends to our cause in Neverwinter. Vam you mentioned you know a few merchants. Can we trust anyone to give us a place to lay low when we get there?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You'll be faster than anyone or anything I can send along.  But when you get to Neverwinter you can check in with Liset Cheldar.  She owns the Moonstone Inn, in the Protector's Enclave.  She'll be able to put you up and find things you need.  Might even introduce you to the Lord Protector hisself!  He'd be able to get a force to be reckoned with, being on the Alliance and all!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"That would be welcome indeed. We might do well to gain such an ally in our cause. Where should we send word to reach you to let you know of our arrival?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix breaks in and says, softly, "I may be able to help with that.  If there shall be two groups, this method of communication will suffice."  She pulls two stones out of her pack.  A sigil it etched into each stone, the same on both.  She hands one to Vam, then one to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"These are sending stones.  They carry a message only to the other, and it can only be sent or retrieved if the bearer or sender speaks the correct word."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the stones intently. "Dear me! Dieter has a set just like these! I don't think we rightly knew their use or we would be in a hell of a lot better spot right now!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If only we could reach him."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The glow in Maouelue's eyes dims considerably at the thought of his missing friend.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stares at Maouelue.  "To send or receive, the word is <i>vuorl</i>."  She puts a hand in Maouelue's.  "We must stop by my mirror before we travel to Neverwinter."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You will ride with us then, my lady?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I will.  But not before I scry for Dieter."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Yes, I would very much love to see what we can of him. Any information we can gain of his status will be of immense service. Vam, Heston, Daran, you should come too. We had all best be informed. Let us to this at once."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All nod in agreement, saddle up, and are ready to go.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trip is quick, seeing as how this time you have Bellatrix in the lead.  She welcomes all into her home, unveils the mirror, and stands before it pensively.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue is caught by a wave of nostalgia and reminiscence of how simple things had seemed back when they were first here.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She wrings her hands, then takes a deep breath.  She places her hand on the mirror's surface.  The reflection fades to black, grey smoke swirls, coalesces.  Colors appear, render into shapes.  The forms take on the visage of Dieter and another man, very well known to Maouelue.  The man is sitting in a cell, looking at Dieter occasionally.  Dieter is unconscious in the bed next to him.  Another form can be seen hazily in a third bed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(have a meeting for an hour)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(feel free to continue the scry though! This is exciting 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix, her hands on both sides of the mirror now, knuckles white, focuses her gaze more.  The picture recedes out of the door, up hallways, through walls.  It takes some time, but after a few beats, a citadel comes into view.  It's dark stairs lead to a spired set of towers, all decrepit and crumbling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the picture moves farther out, the darkness can be seen as the bottom of a chasm.  The chasm, or maybe a dark gorge, cuts a wide path.  As the mirror's picture continues to pan out, the gorge ends and an immense rock wall goes up, up, up, cresting at the rim of a crater, easing down into a caldera of a volcano.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She doesn't seem to be in any pain.  She's more than likely highly exerted herself from the scry.  It doesn't typically happen, but there are occasions where this might occur.  Normal healing should help her.</p>

It might be kinda tough to get to him, unless anyone else knows more about it.  I saw Mount Hotenow, and the gorge that peels off to the East is where the tower-thing is.  All I can think of - and mind you, this is just a terror-tale to scare kids - it that the place we saw was the Sunless Citadel."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston gives a low whistle and slumps back in a chair.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods, somberly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks from one to the other. He has been underground enough to know what fel things reside in the sunless places of these parts. </p><p>“Please Vam, go on. I think, under the circumstances, that no ‘terror-tale’ would be too unbelievable. I saw one of those madmen with mine own eyes animating an abomination. Oh there are dark magicks indeed at work here.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Kids to bed real quick, be back soon!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ayuh," he starts, tilting his hat back and looking grave.  "Legend says there is a dragon that keeps the fires of Mount Hotenow going.  An ancient red dragon, who constantly bathes in the blood of the world..  One day, a conqueror built a tower along the river flowing past the volcano.  The conqueror had heard the rumors and dug straight down into the land to make a path underneath Hotenow so as to directly confront the dragon.  A massive eruption took place after this path was made, and the wonderous tower the conqueror had constructed slid into the rift, never to be seen again.  Crazy story, huh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Crazy....You mean to say the Citadel fell <i>into</i> the breach?... Dieter and I found a vast crevasse underground just before...just...”, He stifles a croaky breath. “...Just before he was taken.” The memory of building the forge, the weight of his armor relieved, the shared sweat and laughs and discovery of the joys of making...it all washes over Maouelue like a beam of starlight refracting off his sword into a million colors, blinding him with chromatic grief. </p><p></p><p>“Yes...he is there. I know it in my heart. Daran, do you remember where you found me?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(lmk if you ever want to live rp this campaign sometime btw.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh, I never even thought of that!  I've been having too much fun with the pbp!!  I might have some time in the next few days to do so.  Some of our 'followers' might be out of the loop, though!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Daran: "I do.  That rift meanders a ways, but the origin is in the West.  If I  had to hazard a guess, it might lead to the volcano.  Truthfully, haven't been brave enough to traverse it."  He smiles, wanly.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah pbp definitely has its own magic to it that i love, but it would be fun to do a bit here and there. would def want to record/transcribe it though.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It all makes so much sense now. The snakes tunnels in Oakhurst, the Muhlen vault, the abyssal ravine... <i>That’s</i> how they’ve remained unseen. <i>That’s</i> how they are moving in the shadows. Sunless indeed. If this is the case...pray, perhaps we should reconsider our apprehension of the matter...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Perhaps...we needn’t stray so far afield after all. Perhaps we have all we need right here. Stay awhile and listen...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They lean in to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage solemnly doffs The Frostbitten Helm and places it on the floor. Next he silently slings the Shield of Disruption off his back and places it to the right and under the Helm. The Sword of the Mists and its scabbard come next, and now the outline of a warrior is beginning to take form. The Giantess Bracers come next and the elven wizard rubs at his wrists as they do, the skin puffy and pale with long suppression. Having donned the splint previously for ease of movement and discretion of sound, he goes over to his Bag of Holding™️ and pulls out the previously animated plate mail from Mulhen’s vault and places it in the center of the form. Lastly, he pulls out a serpentine amulet and a tattered book, <i>The Barbarian’s Wind</i>. These he places directly in front of Bellatrix and his eyes, who have been pointedly focused on the assembly until this point, meet hers in a somber stare.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(TM!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here lie the relics of Lord Muhlen. He kept more than secrets in those halls. The Vault we found was surrounded by undead and grave warnings. Here lie the heirloom treasures of his delving. He sought deep, deep beneath even the lowest foundation of his haunt. The trap leading below the vault carried us into vast caverns of mystery. The book you see here was a gift, you see... A relic left to his <i>worthiest</i> of offspring, his...’dearest daughter.’ </p><p></p><p>As fate would have it, we met the man you saw there...”, He points to the scrying lens, “...in the mirror. That man gave us aid in the direst of circumstance. He saved and healed us when all else would have failed. With us, he traveled deeper intro the tunnels, showing us the way to many curiosities. <i>He seemed to know the tunnels in a way.</i> Frumious, or Frume as he would have us call him, led us to the first of many serpentine artifacts we would find down there. Altars and reliefs of ancient Naga rituals, dark sacrifice, a multi-headed dragon laying waste a continent...</p><p></p><p>As it turns out, some waste was laid on our behalf as well. You see, the serpents...well, three of them stood in this very room the last time we met. Three that have been lain low by our hands. Mine, Dieter’s, Frume’s and...” He stops a moment to consider the curiosity of the mirror men, the Henchys. Just how did they fit into all this? Should he even mention them? “...and some...I’m not quite sure how to explain it, but some magical-summonings-cum-acquaintances-cum-cohort? You see we found this mirror back when we first went seeking Douglas....” Maouleue takes a beat and surveys his audience. “...ah, never mind all that. Suffice it to say the Muhlen sisters <i>and their brother</i> are no more. Just how they tie into the Runmark’s machinations though, I am not yet sure. Please, friends of the light, understand this one last thing, the very place we finally surfaced was right atop a bottomless chasm underground.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It would seem where once we were saved by the light, we may now need descend into darkness in order to restore balance to these lands and to the lives of all who tread near this corruption.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Eyes go wide.  Looks pass between everyone.  They look to the items, then Maouelue, then each other.  All in silence.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, Vam breaks the quiet, saying, "Now, wait a minute.  If you're saying this citadel...  you've possibly been in?  Or near?  Then...  the rest could be true, too?"   He scratches his stubble.  "And what about the Runemark's forces?  If they're using that thing as a base of operations or something, well...  what else could they be harboring down in the depths?  We might have a difficult time taking down a human army.  But what if...?"  His voice fades as the possibilities surround the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It may be that a small band such as ourselves, moving quietly and unseen could be the best chance at taking them down. They won’t expect an attack from within, and if I were a betting elf, I’d say they won’t expect me to go back down in a hurry... Nevertheless, we should take caution. If only there were some way to draw out their forces, draw any of the guard away from the halls within...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix starts at this last from Maouelue.  "But, isn't that what we are proposing already?  Bringing a force in front of them, drawing them out?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I must admit, I am torn. If this is indeed the place, then I fear it will only grow stronger with every passing moment. What of magical means? Could we not cause some sort of disturbance of another sort? One that does not risk the will and loyalty of others? And most importantly, one that does not take so much to time! To think, that I was to lead us <i>away</i> from the place! No, I fear if our man is caught in that dread place, I dare not delay any longer, lest all hope be lost for his redemption.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group ponders.  Bellatrix sits up on her couch, Vam paces near the entryway.  Heston is meandering, taking in the strange ambience of the witch's home.  Daran sits on a side chair, eyes closed, deep in thought.  Worry lines wrinkle his usually serene face.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seconds turn to minutes.  The silence, and worry, deepens.  Vam starts to say something, then shakes his head and stops.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, there is a soft knocking at the front door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lightning hits, thunder rolls, outlining the doorway with an electric white light.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks up, peers around the room at the others.  Saying, "Excuse me," she gets up and heads toward the entry.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She grips the handle, and swings the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another strike of lightning outlines a hunched figure.  When the color comes back to the world, the group sees an old, grey-haired woman, wearing worn travelling clothes and carrying a carpet bag over a forearm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix gasps.  "Sister?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to pause it there, let it settle for a bit.  Have a few more things to work out, too, but I LOVE where this is going!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes! the stakes just keep getting higher. I love it. GG brother.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The blue glow permeates everything.  A pulse beats, intensifying the miasma around Dieter.  He cannot see or feel anything except for his own consciousness within the glowing blue-grey fog.  </p><p></p><p>A white light descends from above.  It is small, even as it gets closer to Dieter it doesn’t grow at all.  This silver-white ball of light stops what seems like inches from the druid, and words emanate in the void.  “Thank you for your trust, Druid.  I fear I may have inadvertently scarred your friend as well.  I will try to make this as brief as I can.”  The ball of light morphs into the visage of a wizened man.  All of his features are tinged blue, but Dieter gets the sense that he is an old human, and his robes suggest a wizard or scholar of the arcane.  </p><p></p><p>“My name is Lord Alezander Muhlen.  I have been entombed in this… place for many decades.  Originally I had heard rumors that this place was the center of Netherese lore.  Upon my arrival, I found illithids making this their base and… reaping the legends of our forefathers.  To my great consternation, they were much more powerful that I could have imagined.  They captured me, tortured me for information.  Finally, they entombed my body in one of their stasis-pods.  Possibly for further experimentation.  You need to free me.  I am lost in here.  However, I can give you a general direction to where I am. Follow the light I can provide, be wary of the illithid warriors, and we will stop their foul plot upon our lands!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(want to take time to properly reply to this one. a bit busy with fam today.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, sir, I'll be doing some fam stuff too today.  No worries, have a great holiday friend!  The best to you and yours, please tell everyone 'Happy Holidays' from all of us!!)</p>

<p>(Merry Christmas Joe! Same to your brood!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
“Lord Muhlen...of all of the spirits to find here....You were presumed dead! Your daughters...you drew them into this foul delve and they... not being so fortunate as yourself have died for it. Your little vipers were my would-be-assassins. We have walked your Vault, we have found your dirty secrets, your lust for power seems to have poetically played out wouldn’t you say? In short, I am loathe to serve the architect of so much misery, the one who brought darkness and destruction to Oakhurst through your greed. But I am not one blind to redemption, and if you would aid me in return, perhaps we may reach an accord... Answer me these three questions Alezander. 

One: Are you a monstrosity-of-a-man or a man-of-a-monstrosity?

Two: What connection do the illithids have with Runemark?

Three: What do you know of Tiamat and *The Victory of our Dragon Queen*?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The visage of the old man blinks; first his eyes, then his entire body switches, almost imperceptibly, between the ball of light and the wizard.  He cocks his head to the side, sizing Dieter up.  He smiles.  (Insight check for more!)

"My daughters are dead, then?  We shall see.  As for my lust for power being played out...  we shall see there as well.  I shall answer your questions, Druid:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"One -I am both.  A bargain was made a very long time ago with the forefathers of our forefathers.  In return, I was to see their glorious light brought back from the brink of annihilation and render up unto them the dregs of this world.  They were to reign again, and I was to be their ambassador.  It may still be, yet.  The torch has been passed, as they so colloquially say.  The time may yet come to fulfill the terms of our agreement.  The Great World Serpent may yet draw breath upon the Material Plane.  And, if it does so, all humanity will fall under their carnage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Two - I <i>am</i> the Runemark.  Or at least, I was.  My death brought upon a great many changes, one of which is the transference of title.  The Runemark name has been handed down from generation to generation, starting centuries back.  My ancestors were sailors, and went across the great ocean to learn the secrets of the Runes from the Giants.  No human had ever or <i>has</i> ever done this, and we were able to grow in power and prestige because of it.  When a Runemark dies, the title and powers are passed down to their kin.  The tricky part is, one can never tell who will be the recipient.  It's not always the eldest, or even part of the direct family.  Bastards have been known to take up the mantle.  It has even driven a few mad when they've received their newly-redeemed gifts.  Needless to say, though, if I <i>were</i> to come back, I fully expect my powers to return as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Three..." He chuckles.  "I'm guessing since you even <i>have</i> to ask me the question, you aren't up on your dragon lore.  Let me enlighten you, Druid.  Tiamat is the world breaker, according to legend.  She, being of five heads of every chromatic color, resides in the Nine Hells.  Since you do not know of her, I assume as well that the Cult of the Dragon has not yet unleashed her fury.  According to the prophecy, there will be one who is able to bring together the elements needed to call forth the Dragon Queen, ultimately starting the Last War - dragons versus the rest of humanity.  It seems there are many old ones who believe this land to be theirs, and will stop at nothing to see it back in their possession.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only thing to do is to release me from my prison.  I, and only I, can right what the illithids and the Dragon Cult are doing, so all Nine Hells don't erupt.  I know it's trading one type of fate for another, but who knows...  maybe there is a way to appease the Naga and not have them usurp Faerun.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(holy shit!!!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter speaks to the wizard, demanding answers, he notices the wizard morph.  As the wizard comes back to his human form, for a moment, Dieter saw a familiar face.  For the briefest of moments, Frume was looking back at him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Thoughts race through Dieter’s mind. He must make up his mind quickly, but this? What could have prepared him for this? Should he save this demon-man and risk the consequences of his resurrection, or allow the dark forces at work to continue their machinations? </p><p></p><p><i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend they say, but what if my friend may also be my fiend...? And what of Frume, is not this shadow also the enemy of my friend? Alas there is no time for deep rumination, but certainly any advantage that may be taken over my pursuers must be taken... I must decide...</i></p><p></p><p>He considers a long as he can, then utters, </p><p></p><p>“Lord Muhlen, you are keen to sense the dichotomy of my dilemma. I offer you this; I will free you as penance for your daughters untimely end at our hands. From there, let us unite in the felling of these dread usurpers. Time will tell if we can be allied, but there is no doubt we have much to gain from each other if so. I’ll take my chances with that, but please, release Frumious. Though his motivations be fraught, his heart be true. Aye, man-of-many-faces-and-names, I will free you. Pray, it doesn’t take me to mine own doom.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The apparition looks puzzled, scratches his beard, whispers something under his breath.  (Perception to pick it up!)</p><p>He then looks at Dieter, serious.  "You have no hope of fighting these illithids without aid.  Mind flayers are known not only to be cunning but to also possess powers unknown to the arcanists of our time.  I will help you defeat these fiends, but the aid I can give you lies behind the closed doors that have stymied you.  The answer you seek lie in an ancient language, but it is not Netherese.  Only in my death have I discovered the truth.  They are illithid shrines.  The west door you may enter with the word <i>Sungovall</i>.  The south may be entered with the word <i>Svankigare</i>.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"In these halls you may find objects of great power, but remember, do not lose yourself in the strength of these items.  Once you have braved the trials to receive these, follow the east past from this hall.  The light I can provide will guide you.  But beware, there are monsters up ahead.  After you defeat the menace, you'll find my tomb.  I will appear to you there and help you continue your quest."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Dieter stretches to hear the hidden whispers, and can only catch: "He......  yet."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have no trust for one who whispers secrets to someone unknown in my presence. Have out with it or stay entombed for eternity. Your mutterings betray you, fiend.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard smiles.  "Not at all.  It is you, I fear, who are betrayed, my young Druid.  I was merely...  surprised.  About why my son wouldn't tell you his real name."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“For one in such need of mine aid, thou woulds’t do well to speak plainly. Your riddles serve neither cause.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No riddles here.  I gave you the information you need to get through the doors.  Finding my body and resurrecting me is in both our interest.  Then I will be able to show you a way out of this juggernaut.  We are done here.  Act in any way you see fit."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And in a wisp of blue-grey smoke, the void collapses in on itself.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is standing where he was last, in the vast, cold room with the banners, the columns, and a very confused Frume.  He was just grasping air a second ago, now his hand is grabbing your leg.  His mouth hangs agape, trying to piece things together.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dastardly Demon....”, Dieter spits.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Riddles encased in a labyrinth entombed in a mystery!”, The disgusted druid deliberates.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As his sight comes back to, he lays eyes on Frume and thinks for a moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wwww...  What happened??  Did you...  go somewhere?  You just flashed!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Did you and the fam have a good Xmas?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah it was great! You?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Very nice indeed!  Tried to fit too much in, though.  I was <i>tired</i> by about 5!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...had a vision of a way out though...it will not be simple.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks worried.  "Aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. What of you? You seem to have taken quite a shock yourself? What was it happened to you?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, I'm sobered up after that light came down and flashed on you!  Thought you were going to be spirited away or summat..."  He takes a deep breath, trying to center himself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah! I’m sure you are, I’m sure you are friend, and for that I am grateful.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes a beat...”Frume, this may seem odd, but I’m fearful we could be in for a fair amount of trouble before we make it out of here. You have been so great a companion, I am embarrassed not to have asked you more about yourself. Hells! I don’t even know your last name, ha! Pray, let us become better acquainted.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I’ll start. My full name is Dieter Deleter, druid of the coast. I come from the sword coast on an island just west of the Trollbark Forest. My family name is actually De Liter, but after....after the tragedy, I was banished and branded Deleter until I return in with my honor and receive absolution.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter starts speaking, talking of surnames and histories, the druid sees Frume start to close off, slightly.  Something in his eyes gives Dieter that there is something there that makes Frume conflicted.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah, partly my fault, I guess.  Truly well met, Dieter.  I'm actually from around the area.  Lived close to Oakhurst all my life.  My last name..  is Bandersnatch.  Family name after a great-great ancestor slayed an enormous beast from the Abyss.  I'm sorry to hear of the tragedy in your history, I truly am.  After all you've done, would you not be able to return redeemed now?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is skeptical.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah! You’re from around Oakhurst? Where did you live?  In the hills? By the river? A big house outside of town?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The last line gets him.  His eyes go wide and he looks down at his feet.  Slowly, he says, "What kind of vision did you have there, friend?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Don’t mean to gloss over the bit about the Abyssal beast as well, that sounded fierce!”...”Wait, oh what’s that? Didn’t catch you there...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Head still down, eyes still downcast, he turns and walks toward the S door.  He starts speaking very heavily, as if the words cause him great pain and are being wrenched from him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"My first explanation to you was a bunch of lies, I was never the hero of a town nor did I lose everything in a fire.  Well... not until recently.  You and Maouelue burned down my family home, so technically, I guess my first statement did come to pass...  in a matter of speaking."  He looks up at Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, if I coulda burned the fuckin' place to the ground before, I would 'ave!  My real name is Jaecob Muhlen.  I'm one of several middle sons of the Muhlen throng.  And," his eyes grow sorrowful, "I'm the Runemark."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He chuckles.  "Although, our youngest wouldn't have you believe it.  Wilm always coveted our father's power and influence.  He was always searching after the next legacy for the Muhlen name.  Problem is, this gift or curse or whatever-the-hell it is that our family has...  it doesn't exactly follow a pattern.  The eldest heir doesn't always get it.  Nor does the most sane.  I actually received it fairly young.  And I tried to give it back, I tried to rectify the fucking situation.  But all to naught, as it seems.  Never found the Giant's lands, never really even crossed the Trackless Sea.  Got stranded out on an island, pirates picked me up.  To get away, I told them..." He starts laughing in earnest, now, "Told 'em that I could turn silver to gold!  Told them I could increase their coffers with a single mark!!  They had me prove it, and they let me live.  Pieces of shite, they all were.  Dropped me in the middle of Luskan for dead.  Well...  well, you wanted to hear my history.  That's just some of the sordid details.  What else did this vision tell you?  Am I getting it all right so far?"  He leans against a wall and slides down to sitting, head in his hands.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Heh, and there we have it at last. Don’t worry Fru– Jaecob, we all have our demons, our skeletons in the sea. The truth will heal in all this and now it is my turn. Alezander...that was your father’s name, yes? It was he I met in the light-of-the-dark. He told me of the secret family history. He railed against the illithid usurpers that have taken this hold. And lastly he...he implored me to set him free...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume/Jaecob immediately looks up at you, fear straining his face as you say this last.  "Aye, that was my father's name.  And if he was fighting ill-thids, or whatever you said, so be it.  He can rot in Nessus for all I care, good riddance.  Whatever he <i>implored</i> you to do, though, forget about it.  He has a sweet tongue and a black heart.  Let it lie, friend.  Let's just concentrate on getting the hell outta this place.  Then, maybe, we can see to stopping my ignoble brother in his insane notion of 'conquering the world', aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye, a silver tongue indeed he has, but not so easily are his deeds swept away into forgiveness. Even as he would seem to offer me aid in this endeavor, never an altruistic motive did I perceive. However, perhaps this new understanding gives you an opportunity for a greater redemption. These beast appear to have his soul captive, draining it for power and secrets. Mayhaps you could be the one to give him his final end? After all, the old scars don’t seem to have fully healed, let alone that new one he just opened in your mind. I won’t implore you, but if we are to survive this, we must speak plainly and true. What do you say?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"One in my mind...?"  Jaecob looks scared and his eyes go unfocused as he tries to reason this new bit of information.  Finally he says, "Aye, you're right.  I'm sorry, Dieter.  For my dishonesty and for my lack of courage.  I'll follow your lead on this, of course.  And if there be redemption here for any of us, let us find it, if only to go back to our families with heads held high."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Time for you to be rid of the ripples of this curse my good man, for you have suffered greatly and it seems little of it is of your doing. I accept your apology and I am sorry to have plumbed the depths of your spirit so, but it would seem, my hand was forced...as it so often has been these days. Come Jaecob, or Frume if you still prefer. We must all wear the name we choose even if we cannot run from that which we are given.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sidles up next to the melancholy man and gestures to the door. “It is time to move on, friend.”</p>

<p>He smiles, getting up from his sitting position.  "Thought it was a nice name, <i>Frumious Bandersnatch</i>!  Got it from a book in my father's study."  He laughs, in remembrance.</p><p></p><p>The word is uttered and stone grinds, the south door swinging open towards the two adventurers.  Beyond is a dimly lit room, the light a pinkish-purple, throbbing to an imaginary beat.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the men enter, a strange feeling comes over them.  (Wisdom save, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sprawling room has a caved wall in the SW corner of the room, a strange stone door sits on a pedestal of sorts, with no form of handle again.  There is a small set of stairs on the E wall raising up to a offset room.  There are several tattered tents or makeshift shelters throughout.  All appear to be empty, at least from a cursory glance.  The pink-purple light is emanating from small braziers all over, at base of all of the walls.  There looks to be something inside the braziers, giving of the strobing glow.  They are not all in sync, however, making you feel a slight bit off balance.  Lastly, the duo notice standard wooden doors to the S and W, aside from to door in the curved wall jutting out.  (Perception or investiagtion on anything you want, just let me know what you're looking for/at!)...(and Roll20 is updated, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As Dieter walks slowly into the room he rubs at an itch on one of his temples. He takes a keen look at the brazier down to his left and makes a note to inspect the tents thoroughly afterward.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter scans a couple braziers close to him.  They seem to have oddly shapes crystals in them, again giving off light.  The tents have seen better days, although, that being said, they have more than likely been standing and decaying for quite some time.  Could be years to decades, it's hard to say.  The animal hide on them was cured, but they are still worn and threadbare.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can take advantage on all of these, Jaecob is helping you!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter looks in a couple tents, he can see into one and traces of dried blood can be viewed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks goes about all of the tents looking inside each to see if they are empty and/or clean.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He turns his head as he passes back by the door and beckons Shelli to join.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shelli lets out a <i>"Mwaaap"</i> and squeezes through the doorway.  As the investiagtion continues, the tents look either picked over or very sparse.  There are remnants of fires here and there.  The one with the blood has a corner covered in it, splashing up on the leathers.  Nothing else can be discerned from the tents, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Jaecob, I must admit, my spirit and body are weary. The encounter with your father’s shade on top of all that led to this imprisonment has taken its toll. Pray, help me gather these crystals to put out the lights and let us take rest in these tents. Not the Pig and Falcon by a long shot, but better than being completely exposed as well. Shelli, we’ll rotate our guard and make sure you can rest too, poor thing.” He strokes a slimy stalk affectionately.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All of the words swirl together.  It doesn't even sound like many people, but the words ram into Jaecob and Dieter's minds without pause.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The glowing crystals sparkle in the darkness.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tents are clear, as they were yesterday.  There is nothing that presents itself to either Dieter or Jaecob, but something does catch Muhlen's attention. He approaches the altar at the top of the stairs.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What is it Jaecob?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'm not sure.  Looks expensive, though!"</p><p>As he slowly climbs the gradual steps, he points to a golden alms box underneath the altar table.  At opposite ends of the altar, two skulls of some lizard-like creature stare down at Jaecob as he climbs.  In the center of the table is an egg-shaped object atop a short pedestal.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter climbs the steps and stands next to Jaecob. He peers at the object curiously, taking it in against all he has seen with the tapestries, reliefs, and of course his recent conversation with the spirit Lord.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Religion check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(afk awhile)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite tell what the iconography is meant for, but it is a brilliantly wrought piece.  Solid gold, with very intricate designs.  There is a lock on the front, looks like it would open like a typical chest.  (Perception for more of the area or investigation for traps/locks.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(in case adv)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's locked but otherwise looks fine to Dieter!  (Sleight of hand for lockpicking, perception check for other things, or investigation if you want anything specific!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is wary about the hidden potentials of the strange room and altar. He moves his body in a circular motion sending out radiating sparkles as he speakers the incantation searching for traces of magic here.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid gets a few <i>pings</i> from the spell.  There is a slight aura around the chest, abjuration magic.  The egg shape on the table has a very strange aura around it, you can't really tell the school of magic, though.  The door on the curved wall has an aura of abjuration magic.  The crystals are also giving off a strange vibe.  Not so much an aura, but something about them is on the cusp of magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The piece of metal Dieter finds bends and almost breaks off in the locking mechanism.  He's able to retract it.  Jacob hands you a pair of lockpicks, saying, "Here, these might work a bit better, aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(on the road as we speak!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Thanks. I’ll give em a shot!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Safe travels!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes the lockpicks and tries his hand at the chest again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Jaecob watches as Dieter deftly delves into the locking mechanism again.  This time, with a few quick twists of his wrists, the lock <i>clicks</i> open, the latch kicks open in a rush.</p>

<p>Dieter can't tell what is wrong with Jaecob, but he infers that it's probably due to the unlocking of the chest.  The golden boon strands closed, with the beating and clicking still emanating from it.</p>
