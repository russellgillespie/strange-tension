<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The march of the heavy plate echoing off the walls mingles with the illusion of a shimmering hum emanating from the Dragon Mage. The image of justice presses on unwaveringly to the lair of evil serpents.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, having had a moment now to absorb this change in his companion, begins to feel bolstered by this confident crusade. Since his last musings on the mirror, he felt empowered having a point of focus foe the battle in front of him...one for whom he wouldn’t have to bear the soulful burden of summoning. In a tight spot, Dieter knew deep down he would be happy to see the countrymen again, but for now he would use the shadow cast by his radiant friend to obfuscate his approaches and gain his advantage. It’s time now to serve the serpents a certain serenity.</i></p>

(Sorry, brother, crazy day, just getting back in.  Got dinner and a phone call with Sean later, I'll probably be able to jump on around 8:30ish.)

<p>(NP brother! Take it easy!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two friends and their newfound companion gather their belongings and head towards where Frume said the lair entrance was.  The party moves through the cave into a spacious tunnel, and along the passage until it opens further into a cul-de-sac of sorts. Moving slower and slower as you approach, you can see figures guarding something at the very end of the cavern.</p>

<p>The party moves further in the cavern and is able to glean a few things.  Firstly, there are no exits save from whence they came.  There are four serpent beings milling about the front of a door, framed and made of stone.  Maouelue can see that there are bodies on the ground, a couple of the snake-beings are tending to them.  They're just off to the side of the door.  Lastly, the wizard sees that the door is odd in the sense that it doesn't have a handle or any other obvious way to open it.</p>

He begins speaking, his words sounding like waves crashing upon the shore, his hands pushing and pulling the drop as bread being kneaded and stretched.

<p>The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group can't quite lock on to the history of the symbol.  Dieter recalls it belonging to an ancient race of serpents, but the specifics are eluding him.  Maouelue has been in this hall for some time, and he has been soaking up the details.  The torches, oddly, seem recently lit.  There are two doors on the right, two doors on the left, and a large, oaken door at the end of the hall 35 feet away.  The oaken door has a strange looking handle on it.  The ceiling is carved and there are wood beams running lengthwise along the passage.  The doorways on the far end of the two on the right and left sides are bigger and their arches are more ornate.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group takes the money and amulets, but leaves the weapons on the bodies. Maouelue places a silver piece in each of the eight eyes before leaving. They move one door at a time, starting on the first of the left set. The mage tries the handle...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens with a creak.  It pulls open to reveal a small room with a wooden coffin in the middle.  There are no decorations or furnishings other than the coffin.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue moves in and inspects the coffin looking for any sign of a name or message.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No name or message.  Looks to Maouelue like a pauper's coffin.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wood is distressed in places, splintering here and there.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He beckons Dieter to help him lift the lid.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The lid is nailed down, but the wood is so old the nails don't catch like they once did.  The wizard and the druid are able to get their fingers into crevices and <i>pull</i> up.  The lid lifts off, revealing a clay statue of a snake-warrior, arms crossed over their chest.  A clay depiction of a scimitar is as if it were in the warrior's hip scabbard.  The eyes are gold bits, but they look too small to be standard currency gold pieces.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They lower the lid back down and move across the hall to the opposite door for a similar inspection.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find the exact same thing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Sensing the pattern, the group moves to the back right room.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This is a larger room that the last, the archway has some words written in snake-ese.  The door pulls open to reveal a coffin, slightly smaller that the other two.  There are reliefs on the walls depicting snake-men using magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two magic users slow and take their time inspecting the reliefs, carefully examining the magical effects being represented.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The depictions are of destruction magics, vile and ancient.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes out his sketchbook and begins drawing a facsimile of the two murals. While the wizard draws his strokes, Dieter has Frumious assist him with the next coffin lid.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This statue is smaller and is clothed in what used to be fancy purple robes.  Tatters remain.  The hands are crossed and there is a silver ring on the hand resting on top.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter steps back, considering this a moment while he pulls out a red bottle and pulls the cork with this canines, spitting it into the corner. He lets out a sneering hiss at the statue as he pulls back and lowers the contents down his gullet, wincing slightly and shaking his neck and shoulders.</i></p>

<p>(Did you want to meditate to do anything specific?  You could also roll a Religion check to see if your patron will answer questions or give you a direction.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to identify this ring and try to connect the dots with these religious artifacts/art)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotcha!  Religion or History check - depending on what you're looking for - on the art.  You'll get the info on the ring at the end of the short rest without any roll.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The reliefs tell of some battles between an ancient race of serpents called Naga, and their elven, human, and dwarven enemies.  These depictions show the Naga as heroic vanquishers of the humanoid races.  (More in a sec.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the short rest wanes, you receive a rush of emotion as you connect with the silver ring.  It is a device made by the Naga, a weapon of sorts.  If you put it on, you can retain a particular skill the Naga possess.  It would transform a part of your body into a serpent appendage, giving it the ability to deliver poison damage with an unarmed strike.  Maouelue feels dread and a sense of warning, but at the same time, emanating in waves from the object, he feels a great sense of power and righteous anger.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hands the ring to Dieter.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Here, shape shifting is your territory...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the ring and turns it over a few times, taking his own read on its energies.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check from Dieter.  Or Nature, if that route would be better.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sense you get from the ring, tapping into the Naga-created object, pushing into the understanding of the types of beings these serpents were...  Dieter is pummeled by a barrage of emotion, mainly vengeance.  Anger and pain war within him as he senses the motives of the Naga.  These beings are pure hate and atrocity.  They wanted nothing more to see the world burn and be recreated by their serpent gods.  Magical items they made for themselves are extremely powerful.  Those left for whomever might find them have...  secrets.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let us be wary of this fel trinket. I dare not put it on.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Indeed. Come, gather what wood we can and pile it here.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gestures to the center of the room. The group makes to gather coffin tops from all the rooms and place them out end to end in a long sort of platform arrangement.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the other two get on with this arrangement, Maouelue attempts to lift the clay statue in the first room on the left they entered.</i></p>

<p><i>Bathamut glints into view after an hour of metal concentration, the squeaking of this bat comes from the ethereal platinum it is made of as its wings pull at the joints.

<p>Bat...  (deep breath)...  Bat-hamut scans the area.  He receives and relates info to Mao about the cavern.  No constructs, there are the W and E exits, which you've already been to.  There are also a small exit to the NE and SE.</p>

<p>The bat continues down the SE tunnel.  Through twists and turns Maouelue gets the sense that the tunnel travels for quite a ways.  There are a few humanoids down this tunnel, they might be on a patrol of some kind.  (Would the bat know what they are?)  Suddenly, the telepathic link fades then is cut off, leaving Maouelue bereft of knowledge of the tunnel's end.</p>

<p>The room is roughly ten by twenty (height by length), stocked full of herbs and ingredients.  Strange smells waft in the air, the sounds of burbling liquids are bouncing around the stone walls.  You can't really make out details as the light is very strange in here, but you can see your quarry standing at the E end of the room, approx 15 feet away from you.  There seems to be an exit on her left (S) and a door behind her on the right (E).</p>

All in all, a variety of ghastly stuff.  The other thing you notice is the lack of ingredients for potion making.

(For the perception:)  Looking around the vestibule area they're in, Mao wonders how the chittering beast even got in here.  There is a door (ajar) on the south wall.  The rest of the walls are adorned with carvings that have been raked over many, many times.

<p>The team exits the S door, it's already open.  It swings wide into a 5ft wide hallway.  To the party's right there is another solid oaken door, banded with iron, 5ft away.  To their left (E) the corridor continues straight, opening into a vast room with high ceilings (30 ft) and massive pillars.  Just before that room is a hallway to the S.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door on  the <i>right</i> opens onto a beautiful golden idol.  Made in a very ornate, flowing design, it depicts one snake, rising into the air, while it's tail curves and wends its way toward the creature's mouth.  It is 10ft tall, what looks to be solid gold, and is positioned on a square onyx base.  (Inspection or perception checks for more!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks at it - looks like a pretty nice statue!  When Maouelue takes a closer inspection, his elven eyes pierce a veil on the idol.  Firstly, the thing is extremely well crafted.  Looks possibly to even be on elvish make.  Second, its a mobius strip oroborous.  However is was constructed, there seems to be only one side to the snake.  Perfectly formed, you marvel at how this was accomplished.  Lastly, you see there are fine gems inset for the eyes.  They burn a bright red-gold in the torchlight.  They are so close in color to the gold, you might have never seen them if you hadn't been inspecting so closely.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party continues and comes to the fork.  There is a hallway to the right.  Maouelue sees, with his dark vision, a thirty foot hallway that ends with another oaken door.  In front of the party, you get a better view of the large room before you.  Besides the pillars, there are many other statues here.  These are not gold, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They turn right toward the door at the end of the hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall trends downward, maybe dipping 5ft in all.  The door at the end of the hall is unlocked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They go in</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door <i>creaks</i> open, revealing a dark cavern warren.  The walls, ceiling, and ground are all poorly dug out dirt.  Roots and vines twine through all.  There are ratty bags of feathers, rags, bowls of grease, and bat guano covers pretty much everything.  As you take a step in, crunching of small insect shells echo and grate your senses.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes a few feathers and corks another bottle of grease.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The grease smells <i>awful</i>.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm sorry, more info, my bad...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a causeway in the SE corner of the room that lead to more caverns.  One goes E, the other S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They take note of this and head back to the the other hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back to the large room, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You enter the massive room, torchlight doesn't even reach to the other end nor does it illuminate the ceiling.  Maouelue can see the dimensions of the room, but the bright light is limited.  (Perception or Investigation on anything, let me know!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks for any sconces or braziers</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are several, all throughout the chamber.  Some still have torches in them, but they look like they've gone to seed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are statues of humanoids, goblins, orcs, a variety of beings littered around the room.  No rhyme or reason, it seems.  The pillars have sculpted snakes running  the length of their 30ft height.  These are very finely crafted.</p>

<p>"Glorgig.  Glem bleh flerg baash."  His speech is very lethargic; sounds dribble from the sides of his mouth.</p>

<p>(Supper!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two heroes both speaking in Giant at the same time, taking their best chance, then laughing briefly about having the same idea. It almost feels like before...for a moment...then Maouelue catches himself and lets Dieter continue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Frumious, do you know this tongue?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage looks over to Frume.  He looks...  astonished.  "I have no fuckin' idea what's going on right here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *sigh* “Fair enough. Dieter, let’s leave the poor beast.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They turn and Dieter begins to lead them back to the statue,  the one with the difficult-to-displace eyes...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I keep on doing this, I apologize...)</p><p>There is a larger exit to the room on the opposite side from the party.  One small route to the SE and one fairly large exit to the N.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Wait here...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter leaves them all looking a bit confused, but heads back to the junction between the burning statues and the golden snake behind the door.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He rushes down to open the door then heads back to the junction. Pulling out the Rod of Sky Fire again, he kisses it quickly then sends a blast at the golden figure, ducking behind the wall and into the corridor as it explodes.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few moments pass, but no explosion happens.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter has been plugging his ears, but doesn’t feel the expected rumble. He peeks around the corner real sneaky like.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Nothing doing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The Druid is intrigued. He decides he had better show the others. He runs to get them and to show a repeat of the trick. This time he stands farther back and watches.</i></p>

<p>(Just to make sure I'm getting what you're up to, you're shooting the golden statue with fireworks, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(updating roll20 a bit. Can I get access to Dieter?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(But, Dieter is about right where I want him anyway. Just maybe a few feet away from the pillars looking back at the sculpture)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(K, Roll20 should be updated.  I have to check it out a bit more, but it should be where we're at.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It's good! Thanks!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter stares intently as the firework blast travels down the hallway, waiting...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The firework hit the statue head-on, exploding.  It is a very nice show.  But the statue still stands.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Fascinating! It seems to drink magicks!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Most interesting.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter runs up to it and tries to carve at the gold with his blade trying to see if it will peel or dent at all.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He says a word in Giant. The word from the other statue above so long ago.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Likewise, sir.  Having a ball!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “You are a Naga.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>"Am I?  What did you say your name was, again?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“That depends what form I take. If you take my meaning.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>"Hmmm...  That as may be.  It is true for me as well.  Tell me of Lord Muhlen.  Why has he not been to this altar recently?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“At last we come to the end of the riddles and get down to the tidings I would bear...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Lord Muhlen...has perished. The citizens of Oakhurst formed a fanatical brotherhood and have ssecretly taken the Lord from usss. While the daughterss sseek vengeance, I have been ssent to sseek your counssel...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>"Very well.  You may recieve my counsel after you pass this tesssstttt..."</i>  </p><p>The voice fades and a small opening morphs into the center of the statue.  What looks like now molten gold ripples throughout the statue.  It seems something is to be presented.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The heroes turn their heads toward each other and smirk, tilting their necks.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks on over your shoulders, curious.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the Staff of Baobab and inserts it into the the golden solar plexus.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He looks at Maouelue</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The things I do for Life...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter moves to insert the stalk of the staff into the beckoning golden space.  Just as it is about to break the surface of the statue, Frume reaches out a hand and stays Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man looks deathly serious now.  With his right hand on Dieter's arm, he reaches and inserts his left hand into the hole in the statue.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh Maouelue...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is surprised by the turn of events, he misses it completely...  but Dieter's eyes see a glint of metal on the man's left hand just as it dives into the hole.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The metal pools around Frume's hand, locking him in place.  </p><p>A silent scream appears on his face.</p><p>An eerie moment passes, then the fighter drops to his knees and lets forth the pained yell.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silence is broken by the sound of terrible anguish.  Blood chills as Frume starts trying to pull back from the statue but cannot.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees the fighter’s precarious predicament and prepares to placate the situation, placing his blade along the man’s wrist...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue goes to strike!  He raises his blade in the air.  As it comes down...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume falls back to the floor, the blade <i>swishes</i> through empty air.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man's hand has been cauterized, the entire wrist-nub is pinkish red scar tissue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume is lying on the ground, hugging his arm to his chest.  He rocks back and forth, cradling it and saying, "No, no, no, no..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Good gods man! What did you go and do that for?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You hear a disembodied voice say (in everyone's mind), "Your payment was accepted."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A small chamber on the front of the onyx base opens with a <i>puff</i> and a small drawer is revealed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Good thing we didn’t got with our...*first* instinct, eh Mao?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue inspects the drawer.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A book is the only thing in the drawer.  It is well made, bound in a strange type of thinnish, padded leather.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The mage reaches in and grabs it gently, pulling it up to inspect it more closely.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also afk. Anniversary!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, man, go enjoy.  And happy anniversary!  And a happy birthday tomorrow!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers at the journal, mildly peeved at the wizard for just grabbing it first...wasn’t he the one that was infatuated?</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s tongue flicks out in anticipation.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's mind is taken away to a room...  a familiar room filled with foreign, magical books and chests with hidden treasures.  At an ornate desk, a gray-haired man sits, writing.  The book is the same as the one Maouelue holds.  Words are being poured over and transcribed into the tome.  Time progresses.  Maouelue sees the elder mage return time and again to the book.  Finally, with a heavy <i>thump</i> the gray-haired mage, looking much older, shuts it an gives it a pat.  The mage calls out of the room.  Two young women answer the call.  The mage ushers them in a shuts the large doors.  In an instant his features turn serpentine, and the two girls react in terror.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He calms the two young ones, lets them see he means them no harm.  He shows them the book he's been working diligently on.  Time progresses more.  As the old man gets older, the two women grow.  Eventually the old man does not show up again and the two women are the only ones using the book.  As the time slows, giving Maouelue the feeling of finality, he sees one of the women steal into the room, grab the book, and retreat down a hidden ladder in the floor.  The other comes in moments later, chasing her.  The vision fades and Maouelue is standing, staring at words of a mage, surging green in the torchlight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Some words are able to be read, some are in a language he cannot understand.  A portion of the tome reads as a diary, expressing the mage's struggles with deciphering the Netherese books he's found.   Another portion of the book contains translations, or approximations, of several Netherese texts.  Lastly, there are several spells the mage seemed to be working with.  It is almost as if the mage was reverse engineering spells based on the information he was gleaning.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Only a wizard can use these spells and read the contents within.  You can either take a spell from first to sixth to add to your spellbook.  Or you can create 1 of your own spells.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oooooooooh)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes the time and stows it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “This will take time to decipher either the proper care. I fear we have gleaned what we can do these caves, but let us persist until the way is shut...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They head back now to the way beyond the lord of stools.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Having a nice birthday?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party starts to move out of the hallway back to the goblin warren.  Frume is having some trouble getting up, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Here let me give you a...”
“...some assistance.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here, take this...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter hands him a standard shield. Hopefully the fighter can at least wield that...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks at it, wincing.  "No.  I... ah...  I don't that'll do, lad.  Might be needing to find another home for me other sword, p'haps."  How holds his stump up to the torchlight to examine it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Come with us brother. We will seek true healing for you. There are ways...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye.  I'll take what I can get.  I in the meantime... you lead the way, gentlemen."   He tries at a smile.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Hmm...let me see that other sword of yours...if er...if that’s alright.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the two sort out the equipment, Maouelue walks in down the hall.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a sorrowful look, he awkwardly reaches into his right scabbard with his right hand and pulls out...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the party makes its way through goblin warrens, you peek into the room you missed on the right the first time you passed by.  Dieter sticks his head in.  This room tapers to the back wall and the corners.  It is littered with dung, egg shells, and noxious fumes.  The floor is a viscous mud/dung mix.  He doesn't see anything or anyone in the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Carry on, nothing down here.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The group clears the area.  Noticing a hallway ending in a large oak door, Maouelue leads the team toward it.  (Perception check from Mao, please!)</p>

<p>Dieter finds something that could be a key?  Frume is no help at all.  Maouelue, as he's moving through the muck near the golblin king, steps on something odd.  He feels it with the toe of his boot.  It has the shape of what he's looking for...</p>

<p>The mage sifts through the slop and comes up with a tarnished iron key.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He heads around to the door and tells us to go find the druid.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter finds the other two and holds out a bone that has been chiseled and whittled to look like a key.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Turns to the door and then search the iron key into the lock, twisting.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens smoothly, opening onto a domed hall.  Three doors exit from this room on the N, E, and S.  The S door is very elaborate, iron-wrought, with an odd keyhole in it's center.  There is a broken wooden door to the E.  To the N, an opaquely transparent barrier presents itself, the flicker of orange flames beckon beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group enters the E door.  A short hall leads to a very warm room filled with a sour smell.  Manacles are screwed into the walls, several sets of them.  Blood of various hues color the floor.  As Frume nears one set of manacles...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bracelet section of one levitates and tries to clamp itself on him!  He deftly dodges, but everyone notices the manacles closest to the group start trying to latch themselves onto the heroes!  (Dex saves!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>As Dieter gets clear of the swarm of manacles, Maouelue gets snagged on one.  It attaches itself to the man's foot, but not tightly.  Enough to make the wizard hop back, realizing he's snagged on something.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another clean slice, and the three are away though the N doorway.  Frume shuts it behind the crew, saying, "That was fun, now, wasn't it?!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>To the left, a darkened room is ominous. To the right, a gaping chasm is a mere fifteen feet away.  There is a small ledge that runs on it's edge, N and S.</p>

Dieter: "Will this labyrinth never end?!!?"

<p><i>They go to look at the paradoxical door to the north.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three approach the opaque glass-like substance of the orange-lit door.  There is no obvious sign of a knob or way to open it.  (How would the group like to attempt to open the door?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They don't yet attempt to open the door. They head back to the South end of the room and inspect the strange lock.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The beautifully made door is solid iron.  Buffed to a fine polish, some of the filigree and hand-formed sections are minute, even for Maouelue's keen eye.  The scene depicts a two humanoids in a garden, surrounded by plentiful bounty.  Many animals set the scene as well, but eyes are drawn, either by some trick of the piece or magic, to a serpent in the center, twining it's way up the female's leg.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's eyes gleam a cold blue light from under his helm, sending a cross of radiance down upon the depiction.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter inspects for a keyhole or mechanism.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a keyhole, off to the right of center.  It seems to be ingratiated into the scene, it is a star on the horizon.  (History or Religion check for more.)  Hinges are on the left side of the door, massive iron buckles.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Mao is left scratching his head, but Dieter gets a ping, back in the recesses of his mind.  He remembers an old tale of a garden, hidden away from the world.  It was said that this garden was where the original elves came into Faerun, but they were deceived by the beings that were already present in the world.  There was something about a star leading them, and a star being the key to their salvation... but he just can't put his finger on the exact phrasing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue pulls out the snake amulet he has been carrying and inspects it more closely.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What kind of check were you thinking?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Checking for any iconography. Perhaps a star shaped facet, etc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(And remind me again, this is the amulet you found on Veena?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(To be honest i'm not totally sure. In my inventory I have "Snake Amulet" lol. I'll try to look back for context.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.  (History checks for symbol, perception checks for the hallway.))</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Dieter keeps digging back, back, and remembers something else.  There were Naga present at that first meeting.  He remembers there was a massive battle, with the elves striving for a foothold on their new land, and the serpents trying to drive them back whence they came.  Maouelue remembers being a young boy and being told about these stories, how his people came from a land across the seas, out of time itself.  It is said that the stars hold the key to returning to that place.  But the way to travel the stars is long forgotten, lost to the ages and usurped by magic.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is nothing about the amulet that is special or that stands out.  The serpent attached is a standard symbol of the ouroboros, the central icon of the Naga.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>There is a mesh covering cleverly disguised as a false floor.  It covers a pit filled with spikes.  Bones litter the floor below.  The pit is five feet across.</p>

<p>“Oi that’s a bit of a jump!”, the Druid remarks.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can normally jump as many feet - long jump - as your strength score, so this shouldn't be tough for you.  But the overhead stone is low, so just for fun, DC 10 acrobatics check to jump over.  Please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group moves ahead and around to the left.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This hall is familiar, although it was seen from the opposite side before.  Just as Frume is about to step on the raised floor tiles, Dieter pulls him back.</p><p>"Thank ye, lad.  Too busy looking at that."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume uses his stump to point at an intricately carved double doorway, oak with iron bandings for the hinges.  Although not quite as elaborate as the garden scene from the metal door, this is just as well made.  The scene on it depicts a ritual taking place, a naked woman is on an altar, all variety of beasts cavort in the background.  Raising a blade in the air, the priest performing the ritual looks odd.  As you all come closer, you can see his face has been seared off, the wood scorched.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter give the door a cursory yank.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It opens slightly, you hear falling metal coming from the other side.  The door is able to be opened, just catching on something now.  Beyond the small opening, the room is dark.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue moves over to take a look, checking for traps and seeing whether he can perceive anything in the room with his darkvision.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can see torchlight flickering off some metal inside, looks like gold from here.  It's near the floor just inside, but the crack in the door isn't too big yet.  As Maouelue pulls back, he checks the picture on the door again.  (With that perception check...) Mao notices it's odd.  Something is odd about the scene.  (Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! I've been hacking away over here and losing track of time as well.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A sudden rush comes to the wizard as he's looking at the scene play out on the wooden door facades.  Immediately, there is a great sense of danger about what the ritual represents.  He's also very sure that this isn't depicting a ritual in the traditional sense.   It's more like the priest is defending himself from the woman.  As he looks closer, Maouelue notices horns on the woman's head...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Who could this dread woman be? She looks to be a demon of the abyss as best I can tell. We need to find the third idol, and quick. Help me open this and let  us make haste!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They all work together to clear and open the door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(If they're all working together, no check is necessary.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The doors swing wide, bringing with them a bevy of golden items.  Kettles, pots, dishware and silverware all clatter to the floor.  It is as if all of these items were piled up and shut inside hastily.  In the torchlight, a golden dais can be seen emerging from the mound.  Many more golden items are piled high on it, the dimensions are large and it basically seems like a pile of golden treasure in this room.  The dais is approximately 5ft by 10ft, placed directly in the middle of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Well well well my dear mage...what have you stumbled upon this time!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The druid riffles through the pile, seeking anything gold resembling an acorn. But no matter if not...he could always melt it...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes more of a loremaster's approach and begins inspecting the items for additional symbols and examining the dais.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are many pieces here to melt down if you wanted, a few pieces of tableware that could be sufficient are around, too.  (d12 for how many you find.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sees the same thematic structure of the door on the walls of the room.  Mainly animals cavorting, then growing larger.  As the scene progresses from the front of the room to the back of the room, the animals seem to grow in sentience, walk on their hind legs.  They start slaughtering the lesser animals, until finally, on the back wall, a gilded form of a demon, two heads of simian make, with tentacles for arms, screams at the sky.  Beside him, a massive serpent is coiled around a tree that stretches from floor to ceiling, the top boughs even melding into the top stonework of the room.  To the right of the serpent, a skeleton with its musculature still attached, has the head of a dragon, the body of a humanoid, the legs of a lion, and the feet of a giant eagle.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue makes his way into the room, he bumps and shifts through the various pieces when, in an instant, the pile shifts...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A rolling pile of golden debris falls around the room.  Revealing a woman manacled to the dais.</p>

<p>“Baeeestttsss! Grreaaaauuuuuueeeoooogggh!!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Calm yourself, my wild friend. There are fouls daemons afoot. Your rage may well be needed, but heed my warning. We must keep ourselves aware.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “There is no time! Come with me!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He leads them back over to the door with the star key.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a wistful look back, Frume follows.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group is clearly beginning to suffer from their long stint underground. Maouelue is losing the thread of his righteous vigor. Dieter is aping out unwittingly. The metal mage rushes over to the door and instead the star key, twisting hard.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door swings effortlessly open.  Torchlight sputtes momentarily, but resolves on a mountain of platinum bars, all stamped with a seal of a foundry from Waterdeep.  All tallied, there are 100 bars of platinum, totalling 5,000 lbs.  A pound of platinum yields 10 coins.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A gleam pierces the armor clad mage’s eye...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Master...Thank you.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Waterdeep...I wonder what this *metal* has bought.” *He fairly spits the word as he says it.*

<p><i>As they finish up, they move to the other end of the room and look at the translucent door again.</i></p>

<p>The group looks into a room with an enormous vat of what appears to be lava as the centerpiece.  There is a scalloped edge with the lava pooling ten feet below the floor of the rest of the room.</p>

<p>What appears to be solid gold, or maybe gilded in it.  The woman is still motionless on the table.  A wound still in her chest.</p>

<p><i>They try to lift the platform off its base.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Selection timed out or was cancelled.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is being very careful to stay back from the woman.  Maouelue searches the area, moving his hands over the bas reliefs on the walls.  He lingers a few extra moments on the triad as the centerpiece of the pictures.  The room seems a shrine of sorts.  Or perhaps, something more?  He finds no secret spaces, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue moves out of the room and back north to look west across the tile room.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A silver Ouroboros is in the center of this room.  With his darkvision, Maouelue can also see scratch marks on the area of the base where the drawer would be.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can you put that location on the map please.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The doorway north of the room you were just in, right?  Or did I mess up?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>i’m looking back across the raised/pressure plates</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ah ok perf)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Across the pressure plates is the room with the stone basilisks.  The doorway across had the stone eggs in it.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The figure in the adjacent room catches his eye and he inspects it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is exactly like the bronze and gold ones you've previously seen.  You can assume it has the same drawer in the onyx base.  Where as the bronze had a key, this one does not.  Words are inscribed on the base this time.  <i>I am The Great World Serpent. I begin where I end and end where I begin.  Name me.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Ouroboros.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The drawer starts to open, then gets stuck on something.  (Strength check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The drawer comes out a little more.  Maouelue can see inside.  A piece of parchment lays at the bottom, and colored jewels sparkle atop it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He is compelled beyond restraint and attempts to secure them.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with adv.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It opens further.  If you're careful you could probably get the contents out.  (Sleight of hand check.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gauntlet is preventing Maouelue's hand from getting in.  A finger brushes against one of the jewels.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Gah...Dieter!!! come over here!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The druid hears the yell and follows</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sleight of hand for Dieter, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He scoffs a little at the gauntlets.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is able to remove the two items from the drawer.  A jeweled encrusted dagger with a curved blade is the first item.  When unsheathed, it is dull black.  It almost looks wet.  The page is written in a serpentine language.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(let’s pause there for tonight! ooooh exciting 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Good with me!  Fun stuff, nice playing!  Have you seen some of the crossover to the People game?  I think it'll be fun to have Maouelue or Dieter to show up one day in the Icespire game!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(yes indeed 🙂 loving it)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can I roll arcana on that dagger?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There it is!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger is coated in the blood of a higher demon from the Nine Hells.  It cannot be wiped off, nor can the dagger be destroyed unless it is consumed in the fires of the Nine Hells.  If this blade kills anything with a soul, that soul is bound to the blade.  Each soul collected gives it the ability to kill an entity of a higher plane, god or demon alike.  This would also relate to the sarrukh, who were the original serpentine race, the progenitors of all serpentine peoples.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The mechanics would work something like a percentage roll for the ability to hit a higher being.  As most gods or demons are <i>extremely</i> powerful and notoriously hard to even hit, this would effectively act as a bypass to AC, or a boost to the hit dice roll.   I have to play with it, but you get the gist!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Until...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter plunges the knife down, his hand grazes the woman's skin.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her eyes open and she looks down at the two wounds in her chest.  Blood starts pooling at the man's hands.  Black blood oozes from the cut Maouelue made, while there is a sizzling sound of frying coming from the site of the black dagger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"M...  Master?"  She calls to Dieter.  "Why?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She is pale, a ghostly white.  You'd never noticed it before, but you suppose she's looked like that from the beginning.  The color of bleached bone.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her hands reach out to caress Dieter's face, lovingly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Destiny.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks into the eyes of the woman.  Blood stains her thin shift.  Her smile beckons him.  Just before their lips meet, Dieter pulls away, pulling the dagger from the woman's body.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She shifts her legs off of the dais.  "Is something wrong, Master?"  She frowns at you.  Coquettishly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Show me your mind.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She cocks her head, questioningly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He holds up the parchment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She cocks her head the other way, looks into Dieter's eyes.  "What do you want me to see, Master?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Enough of this!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Tell me my lady, are you alive?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash’s t the mage, they are black and red.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The mage’s eye glances quickly at the dagger, then back to the lady.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter reels a moment, then looks down at his hand. He is suddenly sickened, and pulls the dagger out, staring dumbstruck at the blade.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman looks at the Dragon Mage, peers at him as if noticing him for the first time.  Doe eyes bat at the man, then back to Dieter.  "I'm alive.  Thanks to Master."  She gets up.  She's rail thin, her hair is waist length and jet black.  It somehow conflicts heavily with her extremely pale skin.  Aside from the dread you both feel, you can't help but think she's one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Tell me, to what ends would you go for your *master*?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Looking intently at Dieter, she says, "Whatever Master wants, I will do."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Lift this altar.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks down, then at Dieter.  Her laugh is a girl's laugh, innocent.  "I can't lift that, Master.  It's too heavy for me.  Also, it is attached to the floor."  She approaches Dieter, slowly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Whatever I want...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Except what I want.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Show me...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She approaches closer to Dieter, smiling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She reaches out to kiss Dieter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Stay your foul advance, hag.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stops.  Looks at Dieter, pouting petulantly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You're no fun."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “You are made of death. Let us show you your final release for you need not suffer any longer.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter is caught between torment rage seduction and longing. His eyes flash color after color.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(This is the hallway connecting the lava room with the other side of the tile room right?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ah, my fault, I thought you were going around.  My bad, yes, I gotcha now.  That pit in the hallway is 20ft down.  5ft wide.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(perrrrrfect.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes. Take this. Dig me a staircase from the pit up to the right.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Offering her a shovel, yes?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hands her a shovel.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Meanwhile Maouelue does take note of Frume’s absence and begins lightly scanning for clues.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman takes the shovel, in both hands.  She walks past the Dieter to the edge of the pit.  Approaching it backwards, staring at Dieter, she stops at the very edge facing away from it.  She cocks her head again, looking deeply into Dieter's eyes.  "We could have had so much fun."  She falls backwards into the pit.</p>

<p>Maouelue checks the lava room, no signs of struggle.  He checks the garden vault.  Some bars of platinum are missing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He chuckles to himself.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Poor soul. He deserves whatever he made off with. This mission took more than he could afford.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He whispers a few words of prayer.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Someday...maybe you will let us make good on our promise...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He turns back to rejoin Dieter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Does Dieter want to check on his charge?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes he goes to look. Ostensibly to watch her work.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter looks into the pit he sees...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His shovel laying on the ground, amidst bones and other detritus.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmph...it figures.”</p><p><i>He goes back over to the lava room and stares down in the pit for a few moments. Then pulls out his bedroll and finds a spot with a suitable temperature inside the room, then lays down shuddering.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees this strange passage of behavior and stands vigil over his resting friend.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he walks away, Dieter hears coquettish laughing in his head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Long rests?  It's been a while!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah they are going to try and rest it out in there. Mao will stand watch and let Dieter get 6 Hours, then he will trance.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, this brings up a really intriguing thing about the image of the Dragon Mark.  How does Dieter, or if he has a conversation with Maouelue about it, the two of them interpret the symbol?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter feels the mark as a symbol of his fight between his beast and human nature. Restraint vs Desire. Since Maouelue's transition to the Dragon/Metal Mage, he is repelled in a way he hadn't been before (charisma -</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Maouelue sees only the separation of the light and dark. He sees the neverending pursuit of the draconic circle as a symbol of his oath to the vigilant watch over life and to ruthlessly pursued the forces of death. He is still learning to tell the difference and thus is a bit impetuous at times, something his counterpart might negatively interpret as being overly zealous, but that is the price he must pay for the connection to his new deity. The choice between two sides of a coin is not one without sacrifice.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So very much metaphorical, not a literal 'sign on the wall'.  More to do with their nature and relevance within the scope of their callings.  Cool!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Is that similar to how Lyz'Urgk sees the symbol, too?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Lyz'Urgk sees the symbol as the divide between his two worlds. He lived half a lifetime on the other side, now he has been here on the dragonborn side for so long, it's hard to imagine what it would be like back on the other side, but he cannot let go of the manifest destiny to do so.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(One thing I've always wanted to talk with you about, and I'm sorry we're taking up space here with it - we can do an email thread if you prefer - I always wanted to know if Lyz'Urgk gets glimpses of his past life either as flashbacks, or dreams, or even when he's very heavily influenced?  Is that why he courts the mind-altering experiences, to catch a better understanding of that 'other side'?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The bard thinks that was why he ended up in this position in the first place. He always believed there was something more than met the eye in his "original" life. He went looking for it and found that festivals and experimentation led him to some very interesting people with wild tales. He kept scratching at this itch over and over through the years until he finally met someone with just the kind of proof he had been seeking, however, he did not anticipate the manor of his attainment of this knowledge. He never <i>really</i> expected it to happen, but that was what made the search fun in a way. A sort of chicken game he could play with himself. Yet the game of chicken grew into a game of dragon. One day the witches brew on offer was the White Dragon... he took one sniff...</p><p></p><p>Now here on the other side, he seeks return. He dabbles in forces and mystery that would pull him closer to the source of these magics. If he could, he would master the gate. He would find his road to and from the other side under his control...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So it's less Quantum Leap and more Eastern religion/previous life, where he knows all that's happened on the 'other side'.  He's not burdened with jumping back and forth, but he does have memories of being the other entity."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He's not sure about the nature of it, but that now fuels his mirror pursuit on this side. Is this happening? Is it a coma? Whatever it is, it's clear it is persistent and as real as real. His questions of how far this fracture goes are never-ending. Is it two sides? Is it endlessly faceted? He doesn't know, but the world he left needs to, or rather, he needs to find an anchor in this fractured set of realities.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Super interesting, sir.  Very complex for a background.  I'm trying to do him justice in-game!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I need to give the rp a bit more of that flavor, but it's been fun kind of pushing the rails a bit lately 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's hard to weave in when we're task-oriented, which I think Oliver and Sean have been a bit worried about.  No worries, though!)</p><p>(Oh, just for fun, do a perception check for Mao's lookout for the long rest.  One for Maouelue, one for Dieter, please!)</p>

<p><i>As Maouelue comes out of his customary trance, he looks across at Dieter, who is huddling near the warmth of the pit. The druid seems worried about something...It has been a harrowing week, and the mage considers that there is indeed a lot to be worried about, then his mind moves on to other matters.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I was thinking...We ought to make our way back up now. There is more to be known surely, but we need to reestablish our sense of what's going on above. I have reason to b—"

Dieter: "What of this place then? Will we leave it unguarded? Will we leave what we have found down here to its fate?"

Maouelue: "No friend. You mistake me. We need to *make* our way back up."

*He picks up the pickaxe and moves over to where Dieter had instructed the weird woman to dig a staircase.

He takes a leap of faith...*

<p><i>Dieter, surprised at this bit of impetuousness, breaks his brooding and slowly a determined look comes over his face. He moves over to the pit and looks down to where the armored man has jumped.</i></p>

<p>Maouelue jumps into the pit, putting his faith to the test.  Yet even the power of Bahamut, in all of his glory, can't stop the spikes from battering him around as he hits the ground hard.  There is something he can feel...  he probably should have had more damage, but instead he's only lightly bruised.  (Take 4 points of bludgeoning damage.)</p><p></p><p>When he comes to himself and looks around, he sees four solid walls, a bunch of bones and debris, and Dieter's shovel lying on the floor of the spike pit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So - what's happening with Dieter and Maouelue?  They take some time and dig into the side of the pit trap...  to anywhere?  You were trying to get under the dais, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Trying to make a path over to the dais. The two are going to build a bit of a refuge down here. They plan to use the dais as an anvil and they will use the heat of the lava to provide energy for the forge. Dieter can also prep Heat Metal to help with this. He has to fight his inner battle about the aversion to metal with his desire for power and some of the spells/skills require components of metal...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(They also are going to need to build a shaft out of here, so they need to get a sense of how far below the surface they think they are at this point and how they might combine their skills to craft a sort of spiral turret back up to the surface. They may need to acquire some...meat and water.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's always the muck goblin...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They're under a pretty weighty endeavor, going to take some time to carve out the earth for the forge tunnels, making the stairway...  I think we could fast-forward with a few things.  For the most part, this area is pretty well taken care of; very few animals prowling around, they should be safe from harm.  You both had rations, and you could see what the herbalism room could yield.  Remembering back to the ladder that originally brought you down, it was a good hundred feet or so, maybe 140.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, I was thinking a fast forward would be good here. They've been staying on other people's terms for a bit now. They needed to make some sort of more permanent camp for themselves. When they found the lava, it seemed like a great place to stay warm and use the energy for crafting. There is still something of a mystery to this place, so if they can fortify it somewhat, they think it will aid in their endeavors. Dieter might be moving in and out of beast forms to help with the digging etc and they would be using their water control spells to shift the dirt around. Ideally they need to make contact with Vam and Heston once they surface.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The digging of the tunnel for the forge and setting up that area could foreseeably take a full two days.  The stairs are an interesting point of order, let me look into that a bit.  Lastly, the securing of the section could be as simple as collapsing a few tunnels or stoppering them somehow.  Depending on how much Maouelue knows, there are always portals or transportation spells or runes, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think they would probably try to collect what wood etc they can and perhaps even some doors from other spaces, also they could use some of the spare dirt to stop up some tunnels.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Someone on the Beyond chatroom said a druid could turn into a giant badger...!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Let me absorb it a bit and check the maps.  There's a couple ideas I had in mind individually, but putting them together might be a bit tricky.  Gimme a few, I'll send you some ideas.  And then absolutely we can rp a first meeting!)</p>

(Hey buddy, I think this would work, but I can't get a closer pic on the interwebs.  Check this out: https://thetrove.is/Books/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons%20%5Bmulti%5D/4th%20Edition/Forgotten%20Realms/Forgotten%20Realms%20Campaign%20Guide.pdf
page 291.  There's the Farsea Swamp right in the middle, and just to the right of that, above Wheloon, is a spot by the 'Star' sea and the Storm Horns mountains and there's the King's Forest right there, too.  Should be plausible to have a druidic enclave somewhere around there.  Plus, I think Maouelue is from Cormanthor, one of the last bastions of elves.  That's in the upper right of the 291 map section.  I'm thinking about a 'meeting' mission, I have a couple pre-set adventurer's league sessions set in Wheloon.)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok, i'm gonna pore over these maps for a bit. I think that probably works, but want to get a sense of the relationship if that's koo)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(hahaha, I didn't take as much time as I could have with the trimming, but it gets the job done</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(And just for kicks, do you see where the other campaign is set?!  How big this map is?!?!?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I mean...we're only 1200 miles away...and that's only 1/8 of the map soo...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I've got it saved too, so don't worry about trying to pin it!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(🤣  I was just thinking about the scope of the whole thing.  There's so much to explore and do!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was looking at a couple areas for Dieter. What about Trollbark Forest?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I like it, still on the Sword Coast... Gonna have to look it up in the book, but should be good.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was just looking for some area that had the swampy forest in between the sea and the mountain. This one seems to have some nefarious history and large monsters including poisonous snakes, so it seemed workable)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That works.  Or the Mere of Dead Men, which is just north there, should be good to keep it in the area.  If that's what you want to do, it's pretty wide open.  I'm good with the locale being other than the Sword Coast.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You'll have a better idea of the lore and where you want to go with the story, so I'll follow your call on this.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Truthishly, I'm good with either.  The Trollbark having snakes in it does play into the theme so far, though!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I like the idea of him having worked himself over toward Cormyr as his wanderings extended further and further. I need to situate our story a little bit. I actually haven't looked for it on the map yet.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Go ahead and pin that map. It will be good to have it there.)</p>

<p>(What do my chars know about their current surroundings? Like I'm not sure where Oakhurst is, but there are some references to it being near Neverwinter. Is this accurate?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(There is an adventure that mentions it, and that map puts it here:)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not too much of a stretch to say they are familiar with the surrounding area fairly well.  The cities of Neverwinter and Luskan for sure, along with Triboar and Longsaddle, some of the other smaller towns close by.  Might have even passed through them on their way north?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So maybe we met Briffo by the fork in the river Mirar or something like that?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We can make that work.  I think I said South from the town, then followed a river SE, which would work for that ravine in the top right box.  It's the same path as the red dotted line, but you're SW of Morgur's Mound.  But we can play it that you're E of Blackford Crossing?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Your call!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool cool cool.  So, Dieter grew up around the Trollbark in a druidic enclave.  Maoelue grew up...?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How about Maouelue comes from Waterdeep.  He was raised in a tower of learning dedicated to the elves and elfish studies?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sorry, been a busy couple of days. But I think this gives them enough to be goin on for the time being, and some places to potentially visit going forward.)</p>

<p>Pinned a message.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>During their long toiling work building the staircase, the two adventurers combed the caverns quite a bit. One day they went over to inspect the giant rift they had been avoiding. It was time to take a closer look...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!  Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>After the toiling work of the forge, the two men decide to take a break and discover the mysterious chasm.  As they travel through the hallway,  the rift blooms into view.  Darkness swells both above and below.  A small sliver of light can be seen far above them, below is complete blackness.  There is a small walkway that meanders both north and south, clinging precariously to what now looks like the edge of a massive stone edifice.  Bats flit about, not threatening the group.  There are some other flying animals mixed in with them, slightly larger, but nothing is posing a threat at the moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers the chasm a moment, then begins to concentrate. Dieter can an ethereal form beginning to coalesce up in the swarm of bats. After a few moments, he understands and looks to back to the mage, now fully in the midst of his ritual. He keeps an eye out for the time being while the familiar descends and binds to Maouleue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>After an hour of this, the wizard comes to and blinks twice at the bat which then immediately zooms upward toward the light above piercing the dark.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He attends a report, telepathic or otherwise about how high it is and what lies above. Should there be any means escalating this slope, the wizard would ask to know of it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat flies... flies... flies...  At the edge of it's telepathic link, it relays to the wizard all it can see. The opening is getting closer, looks to be a scar-shaped gash in the world.  At best guess, before the bond breaks, it's maybe 200ft above the two.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue instructs the bat to fly up to the surface then come back down and report.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As it comes back into range it receives the signal and follows out the commands.  Several minutes pass as the other animals seem riled by something, they flutter upwards rapidly and perch, suspended from the ceiling, tens of feet above.  A small rumble can be heard, very faintly, to the N, and from below.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's new bat familiar returns and reports.  The cavern is extremely vast, the opening is 180ft above.  It is an entrance gouged into what seems to Maouelue as a barrow of sorts.  Ruined stone walls surround an altar or pedestal.  The room appeared to be unused for quite some time as the bat reports detritus all over.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Did the bat see any stairs or ways leading down? Also, once the bat reports this, Mao tells it to go farther up and out of the barrow to see their larger surroundings and time of day.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes note of the rumble and takes a cursory peek at the source of the sound.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check for Dieter)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat does not see any safe way down.  There are ledges and areas cut away from and into the rocks, naturally as far as it can tell, where the two would be able to stand and walk safely.  Getting to those spots could be treacherous.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is.  Sounds big, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Maouelue, I think we should move back for the time being. Let your bat continue scouting, but let's not risk our hides. Not just now...."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Indeed Dieter, I think you have the right of it. We'll need some time to consider this ascent if it is to be so any time soon."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two start heading back toward the forge.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Survival checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Are you cool if I change some spells around assuming they've been doing some of that while building/resting the past week or so?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh yeah, you would have been able to prepare a whole new set.  Two days have passed, this is the start of the third day.  I'll get the bats-eye-view of the barrow in a sec.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kk!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
As the bat is about to take off back to it's roost, it gets the last command from Maouelue.  If a bat could roll it's eyes, this one would have done so just then.  

It makes the long flight up all the same.  As the men are getting back to the forge, the bat finds the wizard and relays the following:  
After a much more thorough search through the barrow, the bat relays the time of day is late afternoon.  Sun was streaming through whole broken sections of stone wall a human could easily fit through.  The altar in the middle of the room is ornamental, it seems to Maouelue to be an accent piece.  Lastly, the bat was able to discern an elaborate metal door he previously thought to be rough stone like the rest of the walls.  The room is 40x40.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue understands the bat's disdain, but...that's what familiars are for to an extent...He'd give it a spectral spider as a snack a bit later...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter tugs at Maouelue's arm as they walk back toward the forge.</i></p><p>"I've got a plan...It's crazy...but it's a plan...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I'm listening..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I'm going to have a bit of a growth spurt, or rather, I'm going to make one. Come, let us prepare for a bit of a journey. Who knows what might happen..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "That's a bit cryptic, friend..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Don't worry, I'll fill you in as we prepare."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(How much progress would you say they have made with the stairs thus far? Are they poking through the altar room yet?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I haven't quite figured out how to do the digging yet!  Technically they're under a lot of dirt and such, I figured that they wouldn't be under a river or anything crazy.  Where would you want the stairs to begin?  And, if they're digging the stairs straight up, they could still be on the Muhlen's property.  Would they dig the stairs into the cavern wall by the chasm?  Just trying to figure out the logic in this fantasy setting!! 🤣)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Mao is digging up toward the dias room and Dieter is digging down from the forge room to fill up the pit and connect with Mao’s staircase. They are first trying to make a quick way for hot items to go back and forth between rooms or a way to move the dais closer, but it sounds like the latter won’t be happening any time soon. They would be using their water and earth magics to assist in shuffling the dirt.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dinner now but i’m down for some more later!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotcha.  I was thinking the tunnel and the hallway between the two rooms could be done within those two days, no problem.  Plus getting the gold items and platinum bars moved would have taken some time.  Either way, however you want to configure your forge, you got it done in that timeframe.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Updated on Roll20, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(putting kids to bed. should be good to go in about an hour if you’re down.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(back)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the two return to their construction, Dieter tells Maouelue about his plan and what they might want to prepare for the way. The wizard shakes his head and lets out a chortle of impressed, and a bit flabbergasted, approval.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>...dear how long had it been...? The time seemed endless in these halls with only the light from the forge and what they provided giving note. Thus the two would venture over to and from the crevasse to note the timing of the light from above, the better to track their days with.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Somehow they had come through it all unscathed, mostly, and the manual labor and reminiscence was working wonders for their camaraderie. Maouelue spent more time out of his shell lately as it was just too unwieldy and hot to wear heavy plate at the forge. Dieter was still making peace with his fraught relationship with metal. He supposed that since the lava's heat was of the earth rather than of burning woods, he was more willing to indulge.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And indulge he did. They did. They hammered away at that gold and platinum attempting all manner of tricks. Maouelue told stories about ancient folded-metal blades he had read about in the archives, while Dieter regaled the elf about water shapeshifters he knew who could cleave a shield with a thin-but-powerful stream of water. It was great to slow down and spend some time together.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>He watched the glow and heat flicker and bend in the platinum as it slowly became red, then yellow, then white, then liquified slowly at first, then all at once falling down into the semi-spherical molds. Next he started pulling them up to let them cool and settle a bit before he would finally flip the mold together and send it down one more time to remove the seam. After a few minutes, he pulls up the rig again and brings it over to the cooling pit, which they had built into the dirt covering the spike pit. His hands glow blue as he sends a ray of frost over the mold to crash the temperature. Steam spews everywhere as he does so. After a while he stops the ray and watches as the vapor begins to dissipate. With a cautious hand he reaches out to touch the mold. He opens up the box and sees three beautiful, pure new orbs, now made of the metal of his master, ready to be put into the line of vengeance.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>He would have to become it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And so he did.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>After several hours, he had managed to make quite a few gold shuriken that he set about applying poison to. As he counted his work, he glanced over at Maouelue, who all the while had been repeating his orb processing, and now sat surrounded by nine shining platinum balls. What a sight. What a confirmation of his belief. We are the light drake, we are the dark snake.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I honestly don't want to follow that up, that was fantastic!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>Over in the corner of the 4-way, Dieter picked up stray shuriken and stowed them in his bandolier. All of a sudden, he began tidying things up and shutting down the workshop area. Maouelue's concentration was broken by this and he started.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Oi, what's going on then?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "It is time. Time for a bit of risk...but you know what they say about that?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "The bigger—"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "—rhetorical..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aaaaaaagghhhh haha haaa haaa!!!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>That one caught the mage off guard and they each had a mighty chortle. Their bags were nearly set, the workings shut down. It was time now to be on their way.</i></p>

*He gestures to Maouelue*

"Please, guard our forge and secure this area. Make yourselves at home and eat what you can find, but you know...leave some stuff for us and...gather some shit too if you can!"

"Au revoir les enfants!!"

Maouelue: "Metal Master! What's gotten in to you!?! Hah hah!" 
*He lets out a mighty guffaw.*
"That was about as impetuous a display as I've seen from you since the pub in Oakhurst!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "You haven't seen impetuous yet..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And with that he begins singing and weaving his arms, pointing his hands at the soil in and around their side of the crevasse upward, rising.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Then he sinks the Staff of Baobab right down in the soil at his feet, sticking out at an angle into the rising abyss of the crevasse's center. A giant Baobab tree begins to ascend up and outward, climbing into the upper reaches of the cavern, a thin route cut out of the enchanted thicket surrounding the tree's trunk.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, sir.  I'm very impressed by your creativity.  We should work together at some point on a one-shot or something.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The largest baobab tree is located in South Africa.  Also known as the 'Muri kunguluwa', or 'tree that roars, the Sagole Baobab is over 100ft tall! [cue the music for <i>the more you know</i>!])</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter taps into a deep pool of druidic knowledge.  Warm humming stems from him and echoes around the cavern, casting harmonics everywhere.  A crescendo of sound, positive radiant energy is visible as golden and green sparkle motes in the air.  The bats take flight moments before Dieter thrusts the Baobab staff into the ground.  </p><p></p><p>At first, nothing happens.  Then, the gold and green motes seem to be sucked into the staff, giving it a glow that nearly blinds the two heroes.  Dieter yells to his friend to stand back just as roots erupt from the bottom of the staff, growing directly into the soil of the cavern wall.  Thick shoots start emanating from the staffs top, and the width of the staff starts to grow.  Second by second the staff adds more boughs.  The staff turns into a massive tree growing from the side of the cavern wall.  Vines have knotted themselves up the side of the tree to make a makeshift walkway/ladder the men can use to climb up.  With a final <i>creak</i>, the tree finishes its growth, a tuft of leaves blotting out the sunlight at the top of the rift.</p>

<p><i>Maouelue stares awestruck. He flaps his jaws soundlessly for a few moments then simply says,</i> “Well done friend! It is magnificent.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two then tighten their pack straps and start to make their way up the long course of thick ivy and vines with which Dieter has surrounded the tree trunk.  It’s a tough slog, but the extra footing and holds help greatly as they ascend. A glance downward shows Quenchy sitting out by the wall of the crevasse smoking a rolled cigarette and making dismissive gestures.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Since there are the footholds, I'll say they can make it up if they're going slowly and being careful.  In the writing of the staff, the tree will stay until you dispel it, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(yeah it will stay there but only bear fruit once a week.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue slog their way up the tree. It is slow going through the thick branches, but they take their time to avoid any...pitfalls.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouleue is suited back up, so he has a particularly tricky time and you can hear his plate armor clanking and reverberating about the abyss, loud to the point of wincing as they ascend.</i></p>

<p>The Frenchmen make themselves at home, picking out areas for their work, and even dismantling the trap in the hallway so they're able to move through with ease.  The climbers hear the bats flit around them, but they do no damage as one of their members is friendly to Maouelue.  All told, the trek up the tree takes some time, but the two reach the top branches and the entrance to the barrow right around sundown.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How much damage would the shuriken do after the Magic Stone is added?  The pebble by itself doesn't do damage, but the added magic helps it become a weapon.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sun is set behind the trees in the west, the haze colors the sky red.  Matching the ground around Maouelue and Dieter.  In the distance to the north, Dieter can just make out another haze.  A cloud of dust is being kicked up.  The details are hard to see, but it is probably the posse coming.  At a glance, Dieter gives it about five minutes until they breach the barrow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter quickly checks over the bodies, looking for loot and info. Maouleue does the same in the south before they rendezvous back in the barrow.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Besides the very dirty clothes and ill-kept weapons, there is a piece of parchment crumpled up and stuffed in the man's trousers.  It reads, <i>"Be on the lookout for two men answering to the names Dieter and Maouelue.  (Descriptions follow.)  These men are bandits charged with stealing from the Runemark.  5000 gold piece ransom, dead or alive."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the message and they leave the bodies. They head back into the barrow and into a corner, Dieter once again goes invisible and Maouelue throws the net over himself.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tension (strange?) mounts as the hoofbeats get closer.  It sounds like thunder, Dieter and Maouelue try to count the number and get lost in the cacophony.   Tense minutes pass.  Finally, graciously, the thunder subsides and sounds of many feet hit the ground.  This isn't just the posse, it's the cavalry.  Steps start hitting stone, and a pair of rugged, muck-trodden boots jump in through the window, swords out and at the ready.  A familiar face scans the area.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Come on now, lads...  I know you've tricks.  Tell you what, I'll put one o'these away and we can discuss terms, eh?"</p><p>Frume sheaths a rapier, but holds his Giant Slayer at the ready, in a dueling pose.</p>

Sooo, here goes.  We're business men, put simply.  We would prefer your help in our ventures.  And I'd be happy to take you to the headquarters, maybe reunite with Culver?  If either of ya is still here, there's really no way to fight yer way outta here.  Just offrin' up the olive branch first, as it is."</p><p>He waits, listening and watching.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two remain silent. Surely this is a ruse...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks about a bit more.  Sheaths his other blade.  Makes a face as if to say, <i>well, okay</i>, and hollers back through the window.  </p><p>"Fan out you lot.  See if there's anything we missed.  And get those bodies buried.  Or burned.  I want reports from the team leaders before nightfall."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sound of many people surround the barrow.  A few come and go through the room, but mostly it's left alone.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes what chance he can as the men come and go. He sidles over to where he saw Maouleue throw the net over himself.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Maouelue, you'll never go undetected with all that metal on you. I'll go rally the boys downstairs and we'll figure out a plan..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, didn't think he could move without the armor attracting too much attention.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So he threw the net over himself and cast nondetection to avoid scrying)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The 15 lets him get by, if you want him to skeedaddle.   But if you want him to look out, the roll still stands, and he can stay up there.  Either way is good.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think it's more fun if he has to huddle up there and try to listen for bits of information, but let's say the roll makes it so his is well undetected up there for the time being.)</p>

<p>(His meditation is intended to charge some spell slots back up. If it can count as a short rest, then great. Not sure if this will take the 4 hours for a full trance or not yet.)</p>

<p>(Let me know if you want to make it a trance.  But short rest is 👍)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Gonna be in and out here for the next bit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are more people coming and going from the room, and suspiciously the same one comes back three or four times, each time checking the altar in the middle of the room.  An hour passes with none entering.  Then two.  Finally, the suspicious man, who looks very rat-like, enters the room and ushers two others in carrying a heavy burlap sack each.  They heft them onto the altar with a sickly <i>thud</i>.  The rattish man sneers at the sacks and rubs his hands together.  Realizing the others were still in the room, he shoos them out hurriedly, and waves his hand over the doorway.  A light blue shimmer covers the doorway.  The man stops, seems pleased, does the same for the windows next.  After the room is sufficiently secured for the man, he goes back to the sacks and starts taking items out.  (Perception check for Mao, please.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pieces he sloughs out of the bag are what remains of the woman Mao had killed to the south of the barrow.  The man arranges the pieces neatly, to make a sort of makeshift person.  When complete, he looks over both shoulders and out of both windows again.  Coming back to the body, he spreads both hands wide over them.   Dark smoke curls around the man's fingers, then hands, then arms, extending down and around the pieces of the dead woman as well.  Maouelue can see the whites of his eyes, or at least his eyes have a completely white cast to them.  He's muttering now.  (Religion check for the speech, Arcana for the spell.)  The bits of pieces on the table start to shudder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is having a hard time concentrating as the words are causing a thrumming in his chest.  A dull ache starts as the words continue to wash over him.  The dark shadow smoke washes out from the man now in waves; pours over the dais and completely obscures the contents upon the altar.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the man stops chanting.  He stands there with his mouth open, eyes white, buffeted in smoke tinged purple in places.  Arc lightning races through the smoke.  Then the darkness descends.  Maouelue is completely blind to the happenings.  He puts a hand directly in front of his face and, thank the gods, he can barely make out the silhouette.  More magic, this is.  </p><p></p><p>The heavy darkness and smoke slough off like ash falling to the ground.  The man is standing before the altar, facing an abomination sitting, staring at him.  The thing has a rat face, but somewhat humanoid as well.  It has rat like appendages, a tail, but also have very human features, too.  It is a perfect blending of the two species.  The rattish man chuckles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(-3 i guess since level 5)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, it's a fifth level spell.  According to the item, I have to do a Con save at...  Did I mean the DC would go down, or up?  One second, it's dinner too...  Let me check on something, I'll be right back.  Sorry bud.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no prob! i caught that it was lvl 5 late.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(shit is getting testy i see ;P )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(aah i see i can spend multiple charges to adjust the dc to levels? so i assume each charge above 1 would add 3 dc?.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm trying to remember what I was trying to do with it.  So, if you were to use four charges, you could negate a fourth level spell if I didn't hit the DC - which is 12 as of now.  To counter a 5th, the DC is going to be 9, and it'll wipe out all four charges.  Does that sound right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(it reads to me like the 5th level is the breakpoint for adding additional dc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Adding or decreasing?  I guess we have to decide who should roll this, too.  So if you roll, I think adding is appropriate, but if I'm rolling to see if the hit goes through, it should be lowered.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(And the description says it imposes a save, so that would mean I would roll.  Cool with all of that?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So i think the default spell-save dc for that is 10 +int modifier of the caster. if i it’s a fifth level or higher, i add a charge to offset each level above 4 or potentially more i guess if i want to overcharge it?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(so i spend 2 charges to make the dc rebalance to 12?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(or i could spend 3 for 15 or 4 for 18?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think originally I was thinking it like the counterspell spell.  With a counterspell lower than than the spell casted level, there is a DC roll to have it work.  Typically 10+Int+spell level, but the person casting the counterspell would be rolling it.  I think I wrote the item a bit backwards where the caster would have to roll the DC, but the idea was to have the shield dispel four level one spells, or a level four spell, or any combination to get to the total of four, but it would have the base DC roll to have to go through as well.  The idea was that a level 8 or 9 spell would for sure go through. 1-4=DC12. 5=DC9, 6=DC6, 7=DC3. 8 & 9 go through without roll, the shield wouldn't be able to work on this high level of spell.  Also, as the Intelligence score goes up, the DC would go up too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The benefit is that you could potentially kill a fourth level spell without using a spell slot.)</p>

<p><i>Dieter leads on hurriedly, Quency follows at a medium pace. The Druid comes around the corner to find Stenchy and Frenchy roasting a stray bit of fungus over a coal from the forge. They both are leaned in, wafting the fungal fumes into their eager faces. A few half drunk bottles of ale surround the scene.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks about, slightly bewildered. The two besmirled faces turn up toward him and waft a large tuft of smoke over into his face. Quenchy steps up behind him.</i></p><p></p><p>“So let’s ‘ave a look at zis mirror, non?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Frenchy & Stenchy: “Oui! Oui! Come closerre!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks askance at Quenchy then turns back to another mouthful of mushroom mist. This pattern seems to oddly repeat a few times, then he turns to take one more mouthful and meets his tail between his eyes, he lunges out to bite at it, but glottal laughter becomes elongated hisses as his ‘friends?’ forms stretch upward laughissing all the way up. The six yellow eyes glisten, then blink as a silver shimmer pulls into view. Shrinking back down slightly, and looking mildly less snakelike, the henchmen hold the mirror up to Dieter’s face and force him to stare into it right as the hallucination begins to fully come up.</i></p>

<p>(Hmmm...🤔  Good question...   Let me see...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mirrors surface shows Dieter, eyes wide and unfocused, yet his clarity has never been higher.  The surface of the mirror is crystal clear.  Yet, now, it starts to haze over with a sort of frosted rim, the ice crystals crackling and creeping to meet in the center.  The center focal point becomes a tunnel, the frost becomes walls akin to the ones Dieter remembers travelling in to get to this accursed underground tomb.  And with that thought, the speed of the tunnel picks up until it feels to Dieter like he is being catapulted though a cone of ice, the end getting farther and farther away.  At the point where he feels he can't go any faster, the end of the tunnel can be seen, a distant black dot on the horizon.  The speed intensifies and the dot grows to completely fill his vision...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He blinks once.  Twice.  Then he notices the stars.  He looks left and purple nebulae waft in the distance.  Enormous floating land masses dot the amorphous landscape.  Their massive bulks house stone buildings, some have trees, others have architecture Dieter has never seen nor could fathom.  In the far distance, it looks like a magic battle is raging, streaks of red, blue, and silver swirl and explode.  A gigantic leviathan swims towards the battle, silently.  Dieter's mind reels as he watches everything pass him by.  And then he realizes...  he's moving in this incredible sea...  Towards...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A small island appears close to the druid.  It's covered in lush grass and a single tree, its branches thick and full of fresh, green leaves.  He alights on it gracefully and spies a pool of water underneath the tree.  The liquid, however, is made of a silvery substance, which reflects the myriad colored lights of this place oddly.  Just as Dieter is about to reach out and touch the pool, a thought comes into his head.  It's the though of a person, featureless but bulky.  Muscled but ordinary, non-descript.  A generic henchman, Dieter thinks.  As he thinks this, the image morphs into existence right in front of him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks over the generic person, thinking, <i>"This looks an awful lot like Frenchy."</i>.  As soon as the though ends, a silvery string of liquid comes from the pool and starts to cover the entity.  The substance starts at the feet, covers the entire body, then retreats the same way it came.  As it retreats, Dieter can now see the features of Frenchy clear on this man.  Frenchy looks around, smiles at Dieter, then sits by the tree, waiting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pool bubbles slightly and the silver string comes out again, this time creating a being purely from it's essence.  This one looks of Stenchy.  A third time this silver stream comes out, a third man - Quenchy.  The three look at each other, then look to Dieter, beaming.  (What would you like to do?)</p>

*She plunges his face into the pool and they are swept away to a tavern, or at least their field of vision is. Their bodies remain rooted in the silver strands above.

<p><i>Begrudgingly the henchmen agree, exchanging dark looks. Quenchy proffers a cigarette and pointedly doesn't offer any around.</i></p>

<p><i>They tidy up what there is of the forge and pack their things, taking as much of the gold and platinum as can be carried in the bags of holding and on the packs of the henchmen. Spare gear is distributed amongst the party, balancing the load and making ready for what is to come.</i></p>

<p>The dagger (not to go pass that up, sorry!) glows like a black light, a white halo surrounds is as it's removed from the dead man's head.  The halo glows bright and abates.  Whomever is holding it can feel him pulse like a heartbeat.</p>

<p>The four adventurers make it up into the destroyed barrow without major incident.  There was a moment when Quenchy, after looking down, was a bit disoriented and slipped backwards on the vines.  Stenchy valiantly stopped Quenchy from falling too far, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As they crest the touch, they look down to see the Baobab tree beginning to glow slightly, then recede into the darkness leaving a treacherous voice behind. Down below, Dieter holds his hand to the shrinking trunk, grabbing two fruits deftly from the branches as the staff reconstitutes itself. Then all of a whirl, the staff continues shrinking and Dieter shrinks with it!</i></p>

<p>As the Dieter-lizard moves upwards through the cavern, the sounds on wonder echo down to him. The group waits patiently, cheering the druid upwards.  About 50 feet up the wall, Dieter disturbs some bats perched upside down, causing him to shift and scrabble. (Dexterity save, please!)</p>

<p>There is a moment where you feel like you're falling.  You grasp out with your arms and legs, scrabbling and slapping at the wall.  Suddenly you're moving downwards and, at the same time, remember you have a tail.  The tail whips and catches on a random vine growing out from the dirt wall, and you are able to catch yourself enough to continue climbing.   After your heart calms down.</p>

There sounds like a lot of people milling about a distance from the barrow.  In the dark its hard to tell the exact distance, though.  He approximates about a quarter mile off.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

(lol here’s the text i have for it:

Drawing on the memory of the cyclone that tore apart your hometown along the sword coast, you have seen firsthand the power of the wind and the damage even a leaf of dunegrass can inflict at such speeds. You feel the rage of your loss mix with the memory of the storm's force then channel it into a slicing spiral coming round after 3 full spins. Hostile creatures in a 10ft radius are rent for 3d6 slicing damage. Creatures beyond 5ft must make a Dexterity save DC 13 or be knocked back 10 feet. This attack may be used again after completing a long rest.
:
We can rewrite any of that.

<p>(Just to give you an example, the fumble would have made you shift your initiative number.  The nat one doesn't hit, but rolling a hit on the confirm basically cancels the fumble chance.  If you would have missed again, its a confirmed fumble.  Same with the nat 20.)</p>

<p>The black knight's body twitches.  Suddenly, he pulls his legs in, pushes slowly off the ground, and gets to his feet.  A blue light is emanating from a locket around his neck.  "You're going to have to do better than that, wizard."</p>

<p>The black knight takes off his helm and throws it off to the side.  Maouelue sees another familiar face, although he has only seen it briefly.  The last he saw it, the man was unconscious and being hauled down a hole in the middle of Oakhurst.</p>

<p>Bazad Dunnol, which you now know as Bazad Muhlen, stares down Maouelue, breathing heavily and tightening his grips on his swords.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It wasn't supposed to be like this!" he yells at the mage.  "You were supposed to join us!  You were supposed to help!  Instead you ruined everything."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Well then, your sister trying to assassinate my friend was a bad start...Tell me, oh most pitiful of the Muhlens, what foul atrocities have you committed at the behest of your power hungry sisters? Why was there no mention of you in your Father’s vault? Just....<i>Dearest Daughters...</i>? Surely, you can see how they use you to meet their ends....Why not be an individual rather than a joined of doomed causes?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Pitiful?" Maouelue can see the tears in his eyes, the trails on his face now.  "Maybe I am at that.  My father recognized only his daughters as heirs to his kingdom of knowledge.  For some reason, only they were invited to his inner circle.  It bothers me not, for they shared with me the fruits of their labors.  They let me know the dark heart of our dear, dead father.  And I would not wish my direst enemy to be aware of his inner thoughts.  To be welcomed by him was to be used by him.  His knowledge, though...  that's a different story.  You were the ones who had the key, he said you unlocked it.  You can bring about the end of all this.  If my sisters attacked you...  either you provoked them to do so.  Or the madness...  the madness has taken them completely."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes. They have been taken... And what of this madness? Will you not stand and break the cycle?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I have my orders.  I'm to bring you to the Runemark.  He knows you have the pieces to unlock father's mystery.  Culver said you went to the mines.  You can find the lost city.  You can bring them back.  You can bring them <i>all</i> back!  But he said your hearts are hard, and you would fight.  We were to bring you in any way possible."  He spins the blades.  "And I intend to."</p>

<p>The black knight has plate armor, painted black with an insignia just poking out from behind a scratch the damage left in it.  He carried a great-sword, a heavy crossbow, and a dagger, all standard.  The necklace on around his neck held a blue crystal, but it is now cracked down the center and has completely lost it's luster.  Lastly, he carries the same parchment the others had on them, a few in fact, concerning the wayward druid and mage from Oakhust.</p><p>(Arcana check for the necklace, history check for the partial insignia.)</p>

<p>The veteran has splint armor that is actually very well maintained.  Standard armor, no +.  He also carried a long sword, a couple short swords, and a couple daggers, again standard.  He had two greater potions of healing and one standard potion of healing.  He also had a hand drawn map of both the barrow site, and a scrawled map of another area, this one unfamiliar to the both of you.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Deep in an inside pocket of his coat, you find two interesting items.  The first is a ring with a marvelous ruby inset.  But then you look, and it's a bright amber color.  When you look closer, swirls of yellow and flecks of black can be seen in tumult within the gem.  It looks like lava made into a gem.  (Arcana for identification, or short/long rest to attune.)  The other is a small carved mink, made from what seems to be a pliable bone-like material.  The minks eyes are very lifelike and sparkle in the dawn's light, which is just coming up over the horizon.  (Perception for your surroundings now that it's lighter outside.  Investigation on the scrimshaw mink for info on that.)</p>

<p>As you both pick through the rest of the thugs, you find serviceable maces, all in various states of disrepair.  A few light and heavy crossbows and a bevy of bolts.  All in all, including the knight and the vet, you found 250 gold, 700 silver.  (Anything else you were looking for specifically?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue and Frenchy go through the rest of the remains grabbing what they could find. They pick up the net and some of the stray platinum balls from Maouelue's triple triumvirate. They also take a moment to pick up Dieter's spare shuriken that he hadn't had time to take.</i></p>

<p>It takes a bit of scouring but (with a great perception roll) Maouelue is able to spot a higher outcropping.  Unfortunately, two things might be wrong with it.  Firstly, it's across a rickety bridge.  Second, there looks to be something on the ridge already.  Other than that, there are a variety of trees around.  Not a forest, per se, but with Frenchy there, Maouelue would feel relatively safe to get his reverie in.</p>

<p><i>Maouleue looks around for the approaching person as his fading friend recommends.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first thing you notice that he's very nimble.  He wears brown and dark green cloaks and leather, blending into the surrounding greenery.  As he gets closer Maouelue sees his lined and weary face, the face of a man that has either had too many quests or been on a very long mission for a very long time.  He strides up confidently, loosening his pack and sitting down cross-legged in front of the wizard.</p><p></p><p>"Good morn and well met, stranger.  It seems you might be in need of assistance.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man lets out a very subdued, but somehow very grandfatherly, paternal laugh.  "Aye, aye."  He looks around the area eagle-eyed, taking everything in.  "If you need anything to eat, I'm about to restart my cookfire.  Just over the rise there."  He gets up and nods to you.  Then heads back across the river.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You can see as he crosses the basically broken bridge that you'll have to be nimble or careful to get across. The stream doesn't seem deep or dangerous, though.</p>

<p>Maouelue hops across the bridge pretty deftly.  Some areas creak, but nothing falls off.  Thinking on the ranger, you get a good feeling about him.  Seemed honest and soft spoken.  The scars are definitely badges of honor from battle.  He didn't seem shy about anything.  You can probably ask him more about them without offending him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hullo there! Turns out it does get a bit cold sitting out overnight in this stuff..." <i>He tugs at his plate collar.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Offer still good to take a warm up here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Pull up a stump."  He has started the kindling on fire and is starting to put larger sticks on.  His pack is open and there are utensils out, a few packages of things, and there are two small rabbits trimmed and ready to be cooked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thanks.... Do you come from these parts Daran?  You seem well traveled."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, well," he cracks more sticks ands adds them to the burgeoning fire.  "Been here, been there.  Been living south of here for quite a number of years.  Thundertree, if you ken of it.  Most of it's overrun now.  You ever cooked coney?"  He pulls out a small cookpan.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I've mainly stayed with flora rather than fauna over the years, but those do look delectable. Thundertree you say? Sounds familiar, but I can't be sure. Do you happen to have a map you could point it out with?"</p>

<p>"Im sorry, son, can't help you with that map.  Heres the one I have."  And he pulls out a fairly well taken care of and updated map of the Sword Coast North.  Thundertree is on the southern side of the Neverwinter River, just to the West of the Neverwinter Wood.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oakhurst is probably the best, to the north there.  But I do know the brigands you're speaking of.  A monstrosity, you say? That big iron man?  You say it took your friend?

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Good playing sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Thanks dude! Good storytelling! Poor Dieter....)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Thanks sir!  Well check in on Dieter soon...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranger nods and finishes with his meal, deep in contemplation.  The meal ends, you both clean up and break the site down.  Daran is particular to not leave any traces of either of your presence, so he takes some extra time fixing the scene to dissuade animals or other people from trying to follow any tracks.  When he finishes, he nods to Lumao, then hefts his pack and head NW, along the bank of the stream.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It's better that we're on this side of the river, the thugs are doing random checks for groups travelling.  Since they know your face, it' probably a good idea to use something to change your appearance as much as possible.  I'm okay in the use of camouflage, but if you have any ideas, I'd suggest we try them first, maybe."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Also, if you want to track Dieter's progress, we can go that route.  I was going to wait for Mao to get to Oakhurst, if and when, to switch over.  But it's your call, sir!)</p>

<p><i>Lumao seems to waver in the morning light, his armor turning into a hunter’s jerkin and his face tuning into that of a older half-elf woman.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He stows his trademark weaponry in favor of daggers and a heavy crossbow.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(or did she....)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Ouelue: “How’s this?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A few prismatic traces linger on the edges as the slender form comes round. A bevy of golden white hair tumbles and gradually comes to a rest as the last of the light pierces out from the eyes. There are a few scars here and there upon her face, befitting the  nomadic look, but under the all-but-transparent crow’s feet there is a luminous beauty radiating under the skin. A sadness of long life, but a joy of constant rebirth.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That'll...  Um...  yeah.  That'll do."  Flustered a bit, the ranger remembers himself and continues, stoically, down the road.  "Now's as good a time as any to discuss the bastards over at the old mansion.  You start, maybe I can fill in the gaps."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Fill in the gaps...?</i>”</p><p><i>Ouelue gestures coyly...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>...then ribs the flustered Daran.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“IIIII’m just fuckin with ya....”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Winks</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What can you tell me of this foul lot?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He now looks <i>very</i> flustered.  He's not used to other people travelling with him, let alone a female half-elf.  Even though he knows it's not.  But does he, really?  As I said, he's very flustered!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  <i>Ahem</i>, well now, let's see...  They came around pretty quickly only a few days ago.  They stopped by Oakhurst then set up camp at the mansion same day.  Their numbers have been growing every day.  Seems like something new comes into the camp at an hourly pace, I don't know where they're getting their supply of followers from.   Wherever it is, the well is deep, apparently.  Plus, I hear tell of some extremely strange... misfits in the camp.  Were-folk, mages, some even suggest arch-mages, if you can believe that.  Could have sworn I saw a Red Wizard of Thay go into the main box they have up on the hill.  Use that as the inner sanctum, I s'pose.  It's been covered over by now with tents and canopies and the like.  It's either a small festival, or a large traders outpost, depending on what you're more familiar with.  My fear is that they'll start to overrun Oakhurst, but they seem to be leaving it alone for the time being.  You say you think that's where they took your friend?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Honestly, who knows... The golem took him North. Could probably follow his tracks come to think of it. I’ve got this here net that might come in mighty handy. Might have to slip into this fine bit o’ splint first though if I’m going to covert route...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>(S)he considers this a moment, then begins to disrobe and slowly don the splint.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, oh dear.  Let me...   I'll just be down by the stream, there..."  He rushes down to the stream.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue is getting a real kick out of this for some reason. Perhaps just the absurdity of it all has made him lax around the edges, or perhaps the fatigue, or perhaps...something about Daran...Now there's a thought...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"<i>Snap out of it Maouelue, you gotta keep your head in the game!</i>", </p><p></p><p></p><p><i>The glow leaves her-their-his eyes for a moment, completely swallowed by darkness, then he retches, keeling over slightly.</i></p><p></p><p>"What is this feeling?

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, no.  You're fine lad.  The get-up.  Just...  reminded me of someone, was taken aback.  Way back, actually.  You're fine, son.  Let's continue on.  Be on the lookout for more brigands as we get farther north, aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Ouelue raises a watery eye.</i></p><p></p><p>“Thank you. Yes, let’s be going. Eyes on the prize.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two tread lightly as they go, making as few tracks as they can, heading off along the river.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I didn't mean to make you feel bad, son.  My apologies."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“No no! I...lost my composure. It won’t happen again.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'd be more worried if it <i>didn't</i> happen again.  Tough times we're living in.  And you're not the only one with a target on your back.  There will be time for revelry, just as there will be time to mourn.  Might not happen all at once, either.  Might have to take those emotions when you can get them.  Gods know I understand."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Lumao fixes him with a piercing stare. Then a quick nod. And onward.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Survival check, and feel free to ask any more questions!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Tell me Daran, about this one...this one that I reminded you of. If...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A ways down following the stream, you come to a path that leads due W.  Although it's away from Oakhurst, Daran says, "Let's take this route.  It's round about, but we should be out of the sights of the brigands."  He's quiet for a bit more, then starts walking.  "Her name was Lura.  She was my wife.  She was...  taken too soon.  It's a long story.  And one that hasn't been told before.  Not yet, at least.  Tell you what," he says, looking back at you, "We break your friend out, it'll be our next campfire story.  That's a promise."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I like you Daran. Thank you for opening yourself to me. Some day you can tell me why a traveler such as yourself would take one such as me on. I do think you have saved my life and Bahamut willing...Dieter’s too.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles.  "There has to be good out there in the world.  Gods know I've seen too much bad, so there has to be good out there.  We just have to find it.  We're well met, Lamao."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(sorry got sidetracked. let’s pick up tomorrow. Icespire!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, sir!  It was good to take a breather on things this weekend, much needed.  Lots to put together for Icespire and I had some ideas for ST, too.  I have an interesting direction to go with this.  Hope all is well, I'll start this up in just a bit!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes indeed! we go pretty hard, so it’s nice to give it some air every now and again. Looking forward to seeing what happens in both!)</p>

<p>The sound of scraping wakes him up.  A food tray with bread and some moldy cheese is slid under the door, letting sparse light in.  From what he can tell, he's in a medium sized cell; hard oaken door with iron bandings, a barred window and a section at the bottom of the door where food plates can be delivered.  The walls are rough stone, but everything smells damp and mildew-y here. </p><p></p><p> He is tied to a dilapidated, rotten wooden bedframe.  He's bound in iron shackles.  His pack and items have been taken from him.  He is not alone.  As his eyes adjust, the druid can see a humanoid-sized lump of something on the bed across from him.  Soft breathing can be heard and seen from the lump.  </p><p></p><p>The bed to his right has a man, sitting cross-legged, carving something.  The man twirls a toothpick in his mouth and hums softly as he works.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(sorry, busy day today.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely no worries, sir!)</p>
