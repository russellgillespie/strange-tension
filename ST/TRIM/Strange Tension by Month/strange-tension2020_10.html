<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid and the wizard, although going quickly, investigate the area thoroughly.  The two cannot tell if the human is Douglas or not, but they take the corpses features down to relay them to the people in the town, just in case.  The ore veins will take a few hours to mine, the best that you could hope for at the point is to take a few hours and get 6 pounds of ore for the both of you.  (Approx 6 gold).  There is a curious section that looks like it has already been mined, but dirt and debris was piled back up quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With that check, it would take an hour to remove some of the debris from the cavity.  Two hours to completely remove everything.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I am quite interested in what lies behind that wall, but let us secure our exit first.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Agreed. Let’s head back toward the entrance, cautiously.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
You both make your ways back up the stairs, carefully, and back out to the main entrance, passing by another cavity in the wall to the left:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find yourselves back at the campfire and the bedrolls.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both stop moving and listen intently.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid and wizard quiet their bodies and minds and reach out in the darkness for signs of life.  You're facing North.  The tunnels you've travelled are to the West and Northwest.  There is a tunnel directly ahead of you, one to the Northeast, and one due East.  There are muffled sounds coming from every tunnel.  The most active is the Eastern tunnel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two adventurers sift through the bones and rubble.  Dieter makes the discovery that there are many races of bones here - dwarves, humans, animals, goblins, many more.  Thinking back, the skeleton that attacked was a hybrid of several races, all attached at unnatural angles.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is scoring on many bones.  Dieter sees that some scoring could have come from animals, but there a quite a few bones with notches clearly made with weapons.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "What...what *are* these abominations?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "These poor creatures have suffered a terrible fate at the hands of some unknown evil. We must root it out and protect any future wanderers from this abominable end."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Let us take note of any human remains here, lest they be from our friend Douglas."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So with a short rest, you can roll your hit die, as many as you want.  After a long rest, you'll get half of them back, rounded down.  You should have only 1 die right now, I'm guessing a d6 for them both?  You can roll and add that to your hp, after a couple long rests, you'll be able to get it back.  Each time you level up, you get another hit die.)</p>

<p>"I...  I think so.  He needs medicine and rest.  I'll bandage as best as I can.  We should get him back to town as soon as possible, though.  What brought you two adventurers down here in the first place?  Not to say I'm not thoroughly grateful, many thanks for your aid here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>He looks at you in awed reverence.</p><p>"My name is Douglas.  You've talked with Culver?  They must have known I was missing when I didn't show up at the damned pub, I bet."

First, help me place your friend in a mine cart.  I'd be happy to push it to town."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I really don't know much about any boss, but we've seen a lot of goblins around the mines lately.  Not sure what's driving them here.  The reason we came is this." He tosses you a coin.  On it are some runes, in a circular pattern. It is finely crafted and the etching was done by a professional. It is a standard silver. However, the markings are unlike anything you've seen before.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Dieter: "That was a close one there Mao old friend! Am I deceived or do you look to have gained more than rest just now?"
Maouelue: "Aye, that was a dark walk I would rather not soon repeat, though in my tango with termination I have tallied new territories of the unconscious. Indeed I *also* feel a new aura emanating from you dear Druid..."
Dieter: "As I dreamed, I felt the coastal waters of my homeland pushing and pulling over me. The sands shifting illusively from stone to sand to glass and back again. I feel the endless flow of time rippling through me as a conduit..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, we can traverse the mines.  Not much to them, really, this part at least.  This is a fairly new dig.  There is a much bigger one across the hills, still a part of the Krytos Hill system.  I was there for a little bit, bunch of Dwarves in charge over there.  Here it was every man for hisself.  There something in particular you wanting to see, friend?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I would rest easier knowing we have cleared these halls of any more dangers. I would like to relay to the townsfolk we have made this mine safe for the time being. Mayhaps we can return to the other side across the hills in the coming days to uncover more about this violent intrusion."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Definitely. Let us be certain about the safety of this mine. Thereafter I would like to consult with my order. Keep your eyes open for anything useful we might take back in this cart."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three of you roll the cart through the East tunnel of the Krytos Hill mine, putting bits in that you think might be useful.  There are some smallish silver nuggets, shovels and pickaxes, various miner-related gear.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the cart is being wheeled out to the main cavern area, you notice the campfire has completely gone out, there is no smoke emanating from it.

<p>Your group digs for some time, narrowly missing stepping on these strange creatures that always seem to be underfoot.  A few hours in, you stop for a break.  Just as you all start again, Douglas's pickaxe lands on something wooden.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Maouelue rush over, and Dieter immediately remembers that there was a strange crevice or depression in the rock wall that they meant to investigate.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You all dig in this one spot, finally uncovering an old chest.  Decorated in gothic iron scrollwork, it reminds all of you of the classic pirates chest in stories of old.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a huge, gaudy lock on the front, banded into the wood by thick iron bands.  The thing weighs a ton.  It takes all three of you to pry it from the wall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He remembers a story of an artificer, a maker of magical items.  He was a sailor, a pirate really, who searched far and wide for a special magic that would make his items renown the world over.  Across the seas, a land of giants harnessed the power of runespells.  Their brand of runic magic was so powerful, it was said to imbue items with a life of their own.  They didn't use their magic for wealth or power, but mainly protection from the outside world.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This pirate found their enclave, slew their leaders, and forced the shamans of the tribe to divulge all of their secrets.  In the years that followed, not only did the pirate become rich and powerful, he became unstoppable.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The party heads back to Oakhurst, the small town where you first met Culver and heard about Douglas's plight.  As you crest the ridge of the hill and head into outskirts of the town, children see your party coming and run up to you, throwing questions at you left and right.  Some run ahead to tell the townspeople of your coming.  By the time the seven of you finally get into the town proper, you're legends.  The wealth in your cart is more than most people in Oakhurst see in a lifetime.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are questions upon questions upon questions.  Offers of free drink and food at the Pig and Falcon come from the owner and patrons alike.  Merchants come up to you offering their wares at a discount, slyly peeking at the glorious wealth in your cart.</p>

Maouelue: “Friends! Townsfolk! Merchants! Thank you for your attentions...

We will gladly regale those willing with our tale in forthcoming days. For now, we must rest and meditate on our experience. 

What news of Culver? Has he been seen hence?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Aye! I’ll hold a table at the Pig and Falcon nigh around nightfall. Please join there for stories and merry making!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *A bit impetuous, but these seem like honest folk...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Everyone quiets a bit and looks around from one to the other.  They call out for Culver, a few even send for him at his storefront.  Cheers go up and rise when the word of the Pig and Falcon come up.  Seems like the crowd will be heading there directly to save a good spot.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Dieter: “I could become a horse then eat myself! Let’s get a room and store our things. I like the sound of the fare down the Pig!”

Dieter: “Maouelue....Culver’s....”

Maouelue: “Let us not speak here...”

<p>(Wise move!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a crowd now outside, pitchforks and a couple machetes are wielded.  They usher you to Culver's shop.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Named Cork and Tow, it sells fishing and farming supplies.  There are wood planks over the front windows, the storm shades.   It has not been storming.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Good townsfolk! Thank you for gathering here. We must uncover what has happened here. When was the last time any of you saw Culver?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Blank looks look back at you.  One peeps up, "Saw him last night, he was at The Pig."  Some yells of assent.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The front door is ajar.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Everyone stay outside while we take a look indoors for any clues as to the nature of this malfeasance.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party moves in and begins to investigate.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party enters in one by one to a room of chaos.  What was treated with love and care has been torn apart, piece by piece.  Detritus litters the floor, shelving is knocked over.  Large casks of some oily substance have been broken over, the contents seeping over what is now refuse.  The walls have been gouged by implements of some sort, leaving long gashes throughout.  At one time a quaint metal candle holder hung from the ceiling, now it hangs askew, almost touching the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Several people try to peek in, you hear gasps and hurried voices from behind the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p><i>They ask Douglas to keep the townsfolk out of the scene of the crime and suggest that those willing fan out and keep an eye around the perimeter.</i></p>

<p>Deiter is starting to think that maybe an animal got in and got loose on some things.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue, closing his eyes, starts to tap into the Weave to give him some insight into what happened in this humble shop.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In his mind's eye he starts to see ethereal, hooded figures move around the room, as if searching for something.  There are several figures behind the counter area in violence with a darkened figure on the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a hulking figure that comes in some time later, from the back, tears through the place, and grabs the figure on the ground by a leg.  Tossing the shape over its shoulder, it lumbers out the back again, the rest of the figures follow.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is now a cacophony of noise coming from outside the shop.  Douglas is not doing a great job on crowd control.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue *mutters*: “There was clearly a great fracas here. I see in my mind that there is more than mystery at play here.  We must rid ourselves of this crowd if we are to gain advantage on our prey.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
*Dieter strolls out the front door and addresses the crowd*

Dieter: “Good citizens. We can all see some foul deed has befallen our dear  neighbor. We must ask for your patience and vigilant watch  while we investigate this matter further.  

Look for news from us on the morrow. If any of ye should carry tidings, I bid ye leave them with the proprietor of The Pig and Falcon. 

Now get ye hence and may the light of The Seven be upon you. ”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crowd disperses, but reluctantly.  Many faces turn back over their shoulders, trying to glimpse what is happening.  Seeder remains behind a bit, but his father pulls him away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter motionlessly watches Seeder recede, until at last he disappears around a corner. At that instant Maouelue beckons the group silently to follow him off the street and around the back of Culver’s shop.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The other two men nod in acknowledgment and follow straight way.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I dared not speak more of it with so many around, but I fear that Culver has come up against something more than fancifully foul. There is a dark force behind this attack and my vision of a great— *was it a shapeshifter?*—form...leaves me with no comfort. We needs again quickly muster our strength, such as it is, and get out of town. We need to search the surrounding woods.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Saynea is surprised at first, but she looks it over.  Nodding, she smiles and brings the supplies over to her forge to prep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Say, I’ve got these materials here as well whenever is convenient.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, sure.  Let's see what you have."  She's still getting things together at the forge, but it's an open workspace and everyone can roam freely around, even right up to where she's working.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue chooses a long sword of his liking and offers Douglas his pick of one standard weapon as a gesture of thanks for his companionship in this unfolding journey.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas clasps the wizard's shoulder, gives it a squeeze, and says, "Many, many thanks, my friend.  But no need.  I have my souvenir from Krytos."  He pats the goblin scimitar with his other hand, smiling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Maouelue: “Here are 15 nuggets for the sword mistress and whatever more you require for the orbs can be arranged.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She ponders for a moment.  "Actually, would these work at all?"  She shows you small remnants of her smelting, similar to ball bearings.  Various sizes are strewn on the floor.  She grabs a few of the bigger ones and says, "Would these work, or do you need them a certain weight or size?"</p>

<p>(Its about 50/50.  There might be one or two that would be larger than a rock but smaller than the ore.  If you want, say, a bag of half-dollar sized silver 'bullets', she'll have to make those.  Random stuff to sling, she's got a variety and in abundance.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “The balance is key. I am quite keen on them being silver as well. There is some intricacy to my proposed use for these and it is imperative they be fashioned spherical. I’ll pay both time and money for the product to be correct. Three five inch spheres...yes.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'll have to make a mold, but I could get those done in a day.  Tomorrow, by the time I close, I'll have 'em ready for ya.  I'll keep the remaining silver as payment, or make it one gold and I'll give you the molding box?"</p>

<p>(Lunch break. Lmk how much total out of the 230 that all needs to work out it. Is that basically all 40lbs/nuggets we brought with?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Lets say you found a handful throughout the tunnels, then dug out the 230 nuggets, 250 nuggets altogether. Each nugget is 10 silver a piece = 2500 silver/250 gold.  You would have gathered, then, 50 lbs of silver.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(10 gold for Dieters staff addition, 15 gold for the longsword.  One nugget for the 3 silver shots, 2 nuggets for the attachment - or did you want it to be bigger?  Each nugget is about the size of a fist, so if the attachment is about 2 hands large, the total is 28 nuggets.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Further down the SW/NE road (named Shepherd's Pass by the locals), near the end of the northern stretch of road, is a beautifully kept storefront with a variety of fun wood knickknacks on display.  The enclosed porch has a plethora of wood workings, everything from kids puzzles to attachments for farming implements.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is an old woman sitting on a well polished rocking chair, asleep.  Dogs run around the side yard and you hear a yell from the back of the house, "Dammit, stop that catterwallin' ya crazy animals!"</p>

<p><i>The group enters the store taking care not to wake the sleeping woman. They examine the wares idly for a few moments and Maouelue peruses for a sling, or the like.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The whole house seems to be a both a storefront and living quarters.  A small bell rings when the door is opened, and a minute or so later, an old man enters from the back.  He doffs his floppy hat, nods his head toward the group, and says, "Howdee folks, what can I do for ye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Well met sir! We are travelers keen on a bit of protection for the road. Do you wave any ranged weaponry about and for sale? I’m particularly keen on summat small like a sling.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotta run for a bit, I'll be checking here and there though...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, aye, got slings, blowshots, slingshots - both hand and stick.  Got some real nice light crossbows, longbows, and shortbows as well.  I do the woodworking and carving,  Saynea helps with the metal parts where it needs it.  M' wife Benna does the stitching and weaving, and she does a right fine job. Got a beauty of a net she just wove, won't break unless you're netting a dragon, handiwork guaranteed!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Well I don’t know about any dragons, but come to think of it, a net could come in lights useful. We’ll take two slings and the net iffn’ ya don’t mind. Will this be sufficient for payment?”
*He procures a few of the silver nuggets.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, dude, fucking crazy day.  I'll regroup and check in tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dude no worries! Hope everything is ok. We’ve been grinding pretty hard for a few days straight now.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(All is well, just a ton going on.  Had to work, then work some more.  We were doing Sabrina's second birthday party with a friend of her and everything had to be done all at the same time!  Just didn't have enough minutes in the day!  All ended up fine, though.  Hope all is well on your end,  sir!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old man, with his white wispy hair blowing gently in the breeze and  sparse white beard, looks astonished down at the gleaming silver in the wizard's hands.</p><p>"A... Aye, stranger, that'll do kindly."  He looks through the group again, as if trying to recognize or at least remember your faces.  "Please, take a look around, see if there's anything else that catches your fancy!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He quickly takes the silver ore from Maouelue and says, "Thank ye, and the net is out front next to Benna."  He hands you two slings as well. (3 silver ore, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Though you know not what these trinkets go out into the world to do, let me assure you, you have just helped  make the realm a safer place. May the light of the Seven shine upon you friend.”

<p>The slings are sturdy but unremarkable.  The net, you now notice, is expertly made.  What is normally a gold piece at a regular city shop, and is typically made of rough rope, this...  Fine leather strands mixed with hempen rope twine is interweaved with multihued gossamer thread the likes of which you've never heard of before.  It catches the light at strange angles, and you realize you can partially see through sections.  (Anyone proficient in arcana can make an check.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This is a net of invisibility.  The gossamer threads, upon closer inspection, are strands of the old woman's hair.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “What marvel is this!?...and what of that woman’s hair to make such an *enxhanting* artifact...
I believe there may be more than meets the eye going on at The Bending Oak. We should return after our next sortie with a keener eye...”

A combination of a ramshackle shed with a colorful peddlers cart with what seemed to be a circus boxcar attached in the rear.  When you enter in, however, you all see a cozy, if earthy, entrance with strange baubles and bobs hanging from the ceiling and in various bowls scattered hither and thither.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A wide set of earthen steps descends to a sitting room set with wicker chairs around a roaring fire.  A table with a bubbling pot stands to the right, no clear source of heat underneath it.

And hopefully it serves you well, too."  She nods to the bottles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the bottles in hand and offers fair payment. Maouelue’s eyes gaze piercingly into Bellatrix’s. He has an inkling of what she might mean, but is eager not to let on to his fellows the precarious nature of their visit.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We are also in need of information, should you be so inclined kind *maiden*. We are tracking a group of kidnappers who have made off with a key member of our community; Culver, if you know of him. We are honestly short on clues and have only just now completed our provisioning.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He nods at the armful of potion bottles with which Dieter is wrangling.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her smile fades.  She looks at the silver ore and gives it back to Dieter.  "Although it is very much appreciated, kind sir.  I have no such use for silver or gold, though."  She shrugs and says, in a soft voice, "No place to use it."  She looks at Maouelue, studying him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, after an uncomfortable minute or so, she says, "Do you by chance have anything of Culver?  A piece of clothing of his?  Hair?  Something he owns?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Surely you *must* require some form of payment?”
Maouelue: “Sadly we have nothing of Culver’s. The closest we have is this map of the nearby mine, but that was only ever *close* to Culver, not his directly.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas says, "Beggin' your pardon, miss...  um...  I... uh...  I have this... uh...  I have this trinket...  and, um...  and it... uh...  it belonged to Culver, ma'am."  He audibly gulps and holds out a small knife.  "Borrowed it some time back," he says to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two adventurers glance quickly at Douglas then at each other, then the witch, and back to Douglas again. Flabbergasted at this turn of fortune.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix smiles at the flustered man, nods as she takes the token.  To Dieter, she says, "We can discuss payment.  Let me see what fate lies in store for Culver.  Then we shall see what payment will be."  She takes the knife over to a darkened corner of the sitting room.  She pulls a dark cloth from what the group can see is an elaborately ornate mirror.  It gleams pristine in the firelight, not a mark or speck of dust is on it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s eyes darken and he assumes a brooding posture.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a bit)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Same)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix pinches the knife by the hilt, letting it dangle point downwards.  She holds it in front if the mirror.  She touches its opposite...</p><p>The reflection of the inside of the woman's house fades into dark clouds.  The clouds roil for a few moments, and when they clear, a scene emerges that is unnerving.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The view is several feet away, looking down on a bloodied Culver.  His hands are locked in manacles bolted to the wall above his head.  His clothes are tattered.  His head hangs to his chest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party gasps each with their own peculiar terrors reflecting in their minds.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The surroundings are dark, dismal.  Some type of cell.  A metal clink is heard, and an unseen entity unlocks the manacles, letting Culver's hands fall to the floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The view follows the Culver being dragged by his hands out of the cell, through a series of dank hallways, and finally thrown onto a wooden floor in front of a chair.  The chair is occupied by a tall man, his features are obscured.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A laughing voice asks Culver, "What did you think we would do, Big Dove?  Eh?  Just tell me where he is and we can finish all of this!  You can go home, clean up your shop!"  Laughing from around the room greet this statement.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell me where he is and who's working with him and you can walk out of here!  C'mon, man!  Let's get this <i>over</i> with!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter casts a furtive glance back at Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Culver moans.  He opens his eye, the other is swollen shut.  He pauses a moment.  Then spits blood at the  man in the chair.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room erupts in laughter.  Dark, deep, booming laughs, almost as if they were hoping for this action.  The man in the chair, the most jovial of all, steps closer to the man on the floor, kneels down, and now a full view of the man is available.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He has slicked back dark hair, thinning in front.  An almost handlebar, bushy moustache covers his pale face.   A few scars on his cheek and forehead mar his otherwise fairly handsome face.  Debonair, even.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks down at Culver with a smile that doesn't touch his eyes.  He grabs the man on the floor by his throat.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a man in dark robes runs over to the mustachioed man and whispers in his ear.  His eyes go wide and he yells at the robed man, "WHERE?!  Find it!  End it NOW!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix drops the knife and the mirror turns back to its reflective surface.  She's breathing heavily and looking worried.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
*Maouelue furrows his brow gravely and pulls Bellatrix’s face to meet his gaze.”

Maouelue: “What happened! Those men...did they see?”

Dieter: “WHERE’S...CULVER?

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The companions are agitated and fretful at this nefarious revelation.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks genuinely shaken.  She takes a shuddering breath.  "I have no idea where that was, I didn't recognize anyone in the vision.  Did any of you?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at Maouelue.  "They knew I was scrying on them.  They had a mage there that detected it.  I thought that was impossible."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Have they seen us? Was the spell reversed?..”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We need to move. If anyone has seen any of those men before, speak now. There is no *time*.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix shakes her head, "No, I ended the scry when I felt him searching for it.  They haven't seen us and I don't believe they can reverse the spell."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas has been strangely quiet.  Could be that he's shy.  Could be something else.  (Perception check.)</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, I think they're talking about me.  It's probably about those rune coins.  I recognize the man, but I have no idea who he is.  Just know him by reputation.  He's the one who originally sent us to the mine, wanted to find out more about those coins.  But after months of digging, we only found a handful.  No idea what he wanted, but it sounds like he's seriously angry about me not checking in.  Don't know why he would take it out on Culver, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Hmm...we’ll speak more of these rune coins on the road. Tell us where we need to go Douglas, on Culver’s life!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't know, I honestly don't!  I wish I did, I...  I couldn't stand seeing Culver like that..." His voice breaks.</p><p>"I might know where I can get info, though.  We have to get back to Oakhurst."</p>

<p><i>The rush toward the door Maouelue looks back at Trix’</i></p>

Maouelue: “Come with us... Lend us your magic to help this man avoid a terrible fate.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She lowers her head, "I'm sorry, I cannot leave here.  I will continue to work to find Culver.  If I find anything else, I'll send word into town.  Be safe.  Come find me if you need any more supplies."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “My lady...”
*He lowers his head in respect and turns, ushering the group out the door.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter sees Maouelue turn and join, he beckons the group to follow hit at pace and charges off down the path.</i></p>

<p>(Yeah, okay!)  Everyone follows Dieter.  Douglas sees something coming closer to him, but the group is moving so well, the thing is left behind quickly.  The edge of town comes into view, and the pace is picked up.  Right at the entrance to town, by The Bending Oak, the crew stops to catch their breath.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to pause it there for tonight, sir.  I'll jump back on it in the morning. Well done!)</p>

Dieter: “Douglas, take the lead.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas rights himself from being doubled over, taking in heavy breaths.  He stretches his back, nods at you, still winded, and starts moving toward The Pig and Falcon.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Time of day?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You all see a mob of people spilling out of the tavern.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(Based on the rolls:) Douglas and Maouelue go around the back way, silent as the grave, nary a one to see them.  Dieter strides out after the two detach from the pack, waves his hand in the direction of the crowd and turns on his charm.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aw thank heavens! I could quaff a *free* pint or two for my troubles. It's been a HELL of a couple days."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter produces his trademark unnecessary flame in search of oohs and aahs.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A farmer, about seven drinks past his limit, first spies Dieter and his flame trick.  He is over the top flamboyant in his praise and awe.  He taps all of his buddies on their shoulders, getting more people into the throng of wonder.  More people from inside the establishment hear the commotion and try to barrel their way out to see.</p><p>(Performance check, if you want to do anything fancy!)</p>

Dieter: "These *flames* are makin' me thirsty!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hush rolls through the crowd when Dieter moves his hands rapidly around his ball of flame.  A bear appears, then grows, as Dieter plies his craft.  The bear grows to four feet high, amazing the people.  It moves forward into the tavern, carving a way for Dieter.  As he makes his comment, a roar goes up and a mug of ale is stuffed into your right hand, a strong smelling cup of something jammed into your left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two stealthy blokes enter in the rear of The Pig and Falcon silently, surprising the bulbous cook.</p><p>"Oy, you two!  Give a man a heart attack!  Can't you see I'm working me arse off here!  I don't need surprises, too.  Get outta here!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas taps the big man on the shoulder and whispers something in his ear.  The man, without looking at Douglas, pulls a piece of parchment out of his vest and hands it to Douglas.  Douglas looks at Maouelue, surprised and somewhat worried.</p>

<p>A "Huzzah" goes up at the mention of another tune.  Douglas whispers to Maouelue, "The owner is the barkeep, Kennet.  Looks pissed, eh?"  The barkeep plops another plate down, this one greasy, fried fish bits and golden roasted potatoes.  The smell is heavenly.</p>

<p>He licks his lips and looks at you.  "Look at this place, will you?  I try to run a clean and honorable establishment, and you folks breeze into town, make havoc, and are carried out as heroes.  Leaving <i>me</i> to clean up the mess.  Just like always.  Adventurers.  Bah!"</p><p></p><p>He takes a beat, looks at the distress in Maouelue's face, and says, "Probably nothing a bandage and a good night's sleep won't fix.  But if you must, there is a priest of Ilmater at the parsonage down the way." (He points Northeast of town.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue *with barely suppressed rage*: Did you make a fair bit of *coin* for the folk *you* invited down the pub on account of us coming here with a cart full of silver? Don't act so innocent sir. We'll not darken your doorstep any longer. We'll be off in search of this priest..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue storms out of the bar, losing control a bit, he works with Frenchy to load Douglas into the cart as gently as possible. They make as much haste as they can while trying to keep the cart steady and head off toward the parsonage.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you travel down the road, nearing the dead of night, the events of the day seem to be getting to you.  You're feeling very tired and in need of sleep...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I fear...we may ourselves need to take our rest at the parsonage tonight if they'll have us. My legs grow heavier with every step. Will this series of nightmares end?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Maouelue sees a spooky blue ghost dwarf out of the corner of his eye!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(JK!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three travelers make their way to a run-down shack at the edge of town.  Nothing denotes it as a shrine, no symbols or totems decry it's patron.  A small woman sits out front, legs dangling off of a bench.  Her head is bowed, her hands clasped in her lap, fingers moving slightly over a simple metal item.  She is clothed in simple brown robes, with only a sash to designate her as an acolyte of Ilmater, the patron diety of suffering and sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue, staggering with exhaustion, shoves the cart a few feet away from the woman.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: <gasp> "...aid.....we need aid! Can you help us? My man here is dying and we are in dire need of a place to rest!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Without a word, the woman jumps down from the bench and comes to you.  Her smile is warm, her mere presence is soothing to you, calming you instantly.  She touches Maoulue on the arm, and a warmth spreads from her touch all the way through his body, bringing clarity and peace to the overwhelmed wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue lets out a large breath he didn't realize he was holding.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Silently she turns to the cart.  She peers in and her countenance changes to that of pity.  It's as if this hurt man, his pain, is causing her pain.  She reaches down to touch Douglas, her hands starting to stain red from his blood.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A yellow-gold glow starts emanating from her hands.  Seconds later, Douglas gasps, his breathing regulates, yet he does not come fully awake.   The glow recedes and she turns back to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He's very weak.  We have no full bedding here, but there are bedrolls inside.  Would you like him to stay here so I can look after him?"  He voice is soft, musical, and... sad.  Yet her smile has not faded an inch, even when she looked on Douglas with pity.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Yes...thank you. Thank you! For my part perhaps it is best to let you work in peace. I'll make my way back to the inn...I think I have strength enough for that. Could we leave this cart here and return upon the morrow to retrieve it?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Of course.  And you both are welcome to stay here with him, if you'd like.  Pardon my not mentioning before.  Ilmater's house is always available."  She bows to you, and starts to attempt to move the man in the cart.  She's about as tall as it, though, so it's proving a bit... awkward.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Frenchy, pray help this kind cleric then head to Dieter to explain what has happened. The lady is right, I can go no further tonight."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With the Frenchman's help, Douglas is brought inside and ministered to by the small woman.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's eyelids begin to close against his will. Only when he sees his man laid down do they finally shut, casting his mind into an unsettled darkness.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Cut to Culver's</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, seeing his companion trod off toward the tavern, slowly closes the door and turns to the bound man.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He kicks him roughly in the ribs.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Who the *hell* are you? Where's Culver?!?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Intimidation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Blood spurts out of the man's mouth as he comes back to a hazy consciousness.  Looking around through swollen eyes, he sees Dieter and starts to laugh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Wracking, hacking coughs cut in, followed by more laughing.  He picks his head up and looks around.  He seems to recognize the place, even by the darkened interior, and starts guffawing, hacking, laughing, retching.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When he calms down, breathing heavy, he whispers something Dieter doesn't catch.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, raises an eyebrow at the man’s show of resistance. He leaves the man probe for a moment and searches the disheveled room for another spare bit of rope or any kind of cord.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do NOT google image hogtied...shudder)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around for rope and finds three different types.  With this being partly a fishing shop, there are many styles and lengths of fishing lines.  There are hempen ropes as in the style dungeoneers carry.  Lastly, there is a nasty bit of barbed rope.  Looks a bit like twine spliced with brambles every few inches.  Used typically to keep rodents away from produce.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Note taken!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter snorts in sadistic amusement as he grabs a length of hempen rope and pulls an end of it through the man’s bindings and ties it off securely. He then throws the other end over the hanging light fixture and tests it for load bearing by tugging on the loose end.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh...  why do I feel this is going to take a dark turn?!  What alignment is Dieter?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I used the quick character builder for these guys so the descriptive stuff isn’t in there for the most part. I’m developing dieter as a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character owing to his inner beast.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Mao is neutral  good.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sounds good, just wanted to check!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Will the light fixture bear weight?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is about to hang it up, then realizes there is no way this thing is going to hold the man's weight.  It's about to come out of the ceiling bolting at any time.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He frowns slightly and looks instead for a joist to hurl it over instead.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The entire place is trashed.  If you took some time, you could make something.  You might be able to use magic.  Looks like there is a door to the back room, you might be able to use that, too.  The room just isn't yielding much in the way of what you need.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter growls in frustration, pulls the rope back and drags the man toward the back room</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He opens the door and inspects the surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This room was mainly used for business.  There's a desk that's been overturned on the far side, an window broken beyond it.  Parchment and papers are strewn all around, crunching under foot.  A large old wardrobe is in the corner, very thick, looks to be made of solid oak.  There also is a now tattered rug on the ground, but it looks to have been of a good quality when it was hale.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter lays down the rope for now, rights the desk and inspects the wardrobe.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man has stopped laughing at this point.  He bangs his head on the floor every now and again, though.  The desk produces nothing of interest, it's been ransacked well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first thing you notice about the wardrobe is, when you swing the doors wide, at the top of the doors, a two pronged hook is fashioned at the top.  You assume this for heavy pelts or coats used in the winter.  (Investigation for more.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There're some winter clothes in the wardrobe, heavy furs and such, all off their hangers and in a pile on the bottom.  A purple piece of cloth is hanging from a crossbow bolt in the middle of the back wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter inspects the cloth and bolt.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are runes, arranged in a circle.  Blood stains parts of the cloth.  The man on the floor starts laughing again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls the bolt free and grabs the cloth. He turns around and drives the bolt into the man’s upper leg.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What. Do. You. Know?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A scream of pain, the man's head thrashes side to side.  A stream of expletives issue forth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A beat or two more, he picks his head up to look at you.  He looks Dieter dead in the eyes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I know you, your whole crew, are dead men.  Dead.  Men."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We’ll see who’s dead and who’s laughing in the end.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hoists the man into the closet and hooks his bindings onto the hook. He closes the door in the man’s face and throws the net of invisibility over the wardrobe. He glances again at the rune cloth and tucks it into his pocket before hastening out to the front door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(D. A. M. N.  Epic level.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man was shouting as you were trussing him up.  When the net of invisibility went over him, not only did the entire wardrobe vanish, his shouts cut off as he was never there.  There were portions of the bottom that weren't covered by the net, but with the craziness of the room, it's hard to tell until the room is cleared.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter heads out the front door, he sees Frenchy coming toward him.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Where are the others?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s eyes, dark already, go completely black at these tidings. He starts walking toward the inn, then stumbles slightly. He leans an arm on Frenchy as they walk back toward the inn.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Dieter: “Goodby Frenchy, you three as well.”

Frenchy: “You mean goodnight! You must be exhausted.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dreams of the adventurers are heavy, thick, like swimming through molasses.  Vague dangers are felt through layers of viscous fluid; words are muffled, faces are blurred.  All three, however, share an aspect of their dreams...  A ring of runes, moving in a circle.  Spelling out something ominous.  The laughing man from the scry can be heard every time the runes come.</p>

<p><i>Dieter is awoken by the crowing of roosters thoroughout the town. His eyes remain shut for awhile as his dream consciousness lingers on the runic circles and laughing voice. He opens his eyes slowly, and looks at the scene around him. Empty is the space where when he last laid eyes, there had been four thuggish mercenaries settling down for the night. He wondered if their...did they even have (spirits?)...if they lay there dreaming of a morning full of silver riches. He wondered about Frenchy. He reaches for the mirror just to touch something that had been part of the summoning, but refrained from looking. Some other time. He looks about the room checking over the supplies that had been strewn from the mine cart by the henchmen and setting them in order on Maouelue’s empty bed. Where was Maouelue? Frenchy...he had said something about the parsonage. “I should make my way there straight forth”, he thought. Reminded of his friends, he draws forth the runed cloth in his pocket, pondering the similarity of those in his dream. He stands there for a moment transfixed. Then, with a backward glance at the pile of silver and tools, heads out and locks the door behind him. He makes haste for the parsonage.</i></p>

<p>Dieter walks through town to the parsonage, after inquiring directions with Denson.  The streets are sparse but the people that see you wave in happy greeting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On approach, Dieter almost does a double take at the hovel that Denson directed him too.  In the light of day, it's barely more than some warped boards fit together, possibly not even nailed down.  A basic bench is outside; a small woman sits, lips moving in quiet prayer.  There is no door to the building.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I keep on going from second to third person, is that okay?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Impromptu meeting. Will reply shortly)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries about the PoV. I think it works.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Top of the morning madam. I am Dieter, Dieter Deleter and I've been told that you have given aid to a couple of wounded and weary adventurers. Theyare my companions...What news of their condition?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods in welcome, says, "Well met, traveler.  I do have new of your companions.  Come with me."  She hops down off the bench, waves you in as she enters the hovel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is a small space, you see some makeshift windows on the left and right wall.  Against the back is a small table with various items adorning it.  There are bedrolls stacked in a corner.  Against the right wall, huddled in bedrolls, are Maouelue and Douglas.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard's mouth is agape, nearly snoring.  Douglas is laying on his back, red-splotched bandages on covering his midsection.  His tunic was hastily bundled under his head as a makeshift pillow.  His breathing is regular.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your wizard friend is fine, just over tired.  The other man was deeply cut, possibly through to organs, there was quite a bit of damage.  The knife was serrated, as well.  He did not have a very good night's sleep, but I did what I could.  He's stable, breathing, and taking the healing I can give, so that's a positive.  If I can get liquids into him throughout the day, he should bounce back quicker."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would like to go and see about more bandages and some cleaning solution for the wound, would you like to stay while the awake?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Yes...yes. Thank you. I'll watch over them."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Recollections of last night's drunken escalation flash through Dieter's mind and he feels a deep pang of guilt and sorrow as he looks down on the victims of his rashness.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He bends down, taking a closer look at Douglas, then with a steely exhale, he touches Maouelue's shoulder.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Awaken, weary wizard. We would do well not to waste one waking wink, if we would weather this worry, wrangle our wisdom, and wrestle with wrath."

<p><i>They turn to look at Douglas</i></p>

<p><i>Dieter appears lost in thought. He idly produces a flame and unconsciously rotates through the rune shapes that have haunted his recent waking and dreaming hours.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue stirs as he sees the symbols...His eyes glass over slightly and he involuntarily begins to trace the runes with an incredibly thin ray of frost.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trance leads down psychic bends, twists, turns.  Visions mentally fly by the two, trying to come together in some semblance of understanding.  Both are  trying, straining to make sense of their shared dreams.  Suddenly, the trance breaks...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And they see a piece of parchment next to Douglas is on fire.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Where is the purple cloth?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(In Dieter’s chest pocket.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter also feels a sudden heat in his chest pocket.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees Dieter wince and looks down at his coat pocket. He reaches out with his icy hands and attempts to free the now-glowing rune cloth.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue extracts the cloth and sees that it is somewhat waxen, so it's not completely up in flames.  However, it is hot to the touch and in need of the cooling touch of the wizard. </p><p></p><p>The runes stand out on the cloth a yellow-gold, almost searingly bright.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter attempts to snuff out the flaming parchment with a few drops of water from his skin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The flame goes out, but the parchment is scorched beyond recognition.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks for any nearby container he might use to contain the pieces of the charred sheet.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The table holds some odd knickknacks.  A handknife, a pearl of decent size, a couple coppers, and a strange necklace.  The necklace has a burnished and rust-scarred pendant that lies open.  The pendant is ovoid and hollow on the inside, it looks as if it could carry ashes or something of the like.</p>

Maouelue: "Mind our friend here a moment. I need to check something outside."

<p><i>He moves quickly to the door, opens it, and peers down the lane seeking the source of the scream.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue peeks out from the doorway, there are several people running toward the center of town.  Some folks are bringing buckets of water, some two at a time, running towards what Maouelue can see is smoke billowing from somewhere down the street.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With a cursory glance back at his preoccupied friend, he exits and closes the door behind him, then runs full speed down the street directly toward the smoke.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few steps outside the parsonage, a very beautiful young woman locks eyes with you as she's running towards your end of town.  She makes a beeline for the wizard.  As she gets closer, she says, "Are you Maouelue, the man with Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...Who asks?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"My name is Kirra, I'm Denson's daughter.  He sent me to find you.  There's been an accident in your room.  We need you or your friend's help, please!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Accident?..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hastens his pace and joins the maiden.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes!  Please come, quickly!"  She takes off toward The Sleeping Sheep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue follows apace.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both come around the corner, bumping into more people as the crowd from the other night seems to have just shifted buildings.  This morning, however, no one is in a jovial mood.  They're running a bucket brigade to put out a fire emanating from the side of the Sleeping Sheep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue, the budding frost mage, shouts for the crowd to stand aside and immediately begins to channel a ray of frost at the blaze, attempting to contain the outer edges of the fire to prevent the spread.</i></p>

<p>Denson meets both you and Kirra as you enter the burned out section of the Sheep.  </p><p>"I'm sorry about this, Master Wizard.  I was hoping to catch you myself, but the fire hastened faster than I thought it would.  Had to organize the brigade as soon as I could."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shakes his head.  "Looks like a good deal of damage.  Was there anything expensive left in your rooms, goodsir?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Not at all dear Denson. It is my woe that our presence has so disrupted the community and caused this wreckage. Might be that our wooden tools could be wrecked, but I reckon the ore will only be the better for it. It seems fate has done well to call our company away from here..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, I'm glad of that, too.  I have to be off, need to talk with the town elders, see about repairing the damage as soon as we can.  Please let Kirra know if you need anything, or happen to find out what caused it all."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Denson...before you leave. There is a matter I would have you take up with the elders..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It would seem that our presence here hath brought some form of wealth through our efforts out at the mine..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"However, it is also clear that, whether it was here prior or not, we have also drawn out foul actors and in turn share some responsibility for the fate of the town and its people..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"With good faith, I would use this silver to settle our debts and grievances with the good merchants and proprietors and do one better..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We met a young boy in the street yesterday...He said to us, <i>We take care of our own here, m'lord.</i>..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah...  Aye, aye goodman Wizard.  I'll be sure to relay your interests to the Council.  They would be very happy to hear of your interest to protect the town."  He bows low to you.  "Mell met, kind sir.  Kirra, please let me know if these men need anything."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And with that, he turns and hastens away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue *turns to the crowd*: "Good people! I bid you all heed my words. Dark forces are stirring. We know not remotely where these events might lead us, but fret not. Together...we will root out these nefarious actors. Prithee keep a vigilant eye and look to each other while the Council takes its decisions."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Go now and secure your homes and lands. We will address the town thereafter."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The milling crowd lets out a tired but heartening, "Huzzah," and quickly goes back to their respective daily grinds.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Kirra says to Maouelue, "You have quite a way with words, Master Wizard.  And we very much appreciate what you've said you'll do for the town.  If you pardon my asking, why do you think an evil has beset Oakhurst?  We're not much to speak of."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Who knows the minds of those bent to the will of evil...yet, we have had some cause for concern. Dark dreams...a scrying vision. Yet, I dare not say more here in this exposure. Let us retire to more private chambers, but first...I bid thee, look into this glowing silver...what do you see?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry brother, afk for a bit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(All good!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh...  My, okay.  Let me see..."  She steps gingerly into the wreckage of your former room, taking care not to step on anything smoking or water-logged.  She squats on her haunches when she gets near to the pile of now dimly glowing coins.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There's something written on these.  On all of them. But I... I can't quite...  No.  I can't make it out at all.  Looks to be some other language.  Are these your coins?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...I don't seem to remember leaving coins. Silver yes, but coins?...I must ask too much of you. I dare not look into those markings before I know more. I seem to be...particularly affected by runes connected to this mystery. Have you a strong container, perhaps made of metal that would contain these coins? We need to clear the room of these and my band's possessions. Dieter will want to know of this as well."

<p><i>Maouelue summons a fey arctic fox, takes out a book, pen, and ink from his backpack, then quickly scrawls a message relaying these events to Dieter, bidding him to join them in the drawing room of The Sleeping Sheep as soon as possible. He tears the page out and quickly rolls it up, then places it in the fox's trap. He then touches a glowing blue spot in the middle of its forehead with his thumb and forefinger, telepathically directing the fey creature to bring this at once to Dieter at the parsonage of Ilmater.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sits in ritual to produce a fox companion.  As he does so, Kirra searches The Sheep as well as surrounding shops for a metal container for the coins.  She comes back to the wizard disheartened and empty handed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I could find no metal box that would work for what you want.  There is a metal coffer Kentham owns, it is too small for this amount, though."</p>

Maouelue: “I see...”

<p>"Oh...  Um... Through here.  You can use our gathering room."  She leads you to a larger room guests use as a dining hall.  It's a decent sized common room, with some recessed corner tables you can use to set up shop.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Thank you mistress. Would it be too much to ask of you to mind the coin pile while I secure the rest?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Of course, I would be happy to.  Would you like me to bring you anything before I do?"</p>

<p>You first see the blood on the bandage recede.  Douglas's eyes flutter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think it might be cool to do half potions, you can mark down a half of a regular used.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ah, I see, if it’s something you want to try, I’m happy to test it out.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes Douglas’s head in hand and gasps, “My friend!”</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He's not very strong yet, holding his head feels like holding a heavy, unbalanced melon.  His eyes flutter some more, then, slowly, they open.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Douglas! Who did this to you my good man?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks around the room with his eyes, not daring to lift his head yet.</p><p>"I... didn't see his face.  He came outta nowhere.  Put the knife into my gut.  When he pulled it out, I screamed and...  then everything went black.   How long have I been out?  Where are we?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We are in the parsonage of Ilmater. You’ve just spent the night. The man you were watching. What if him?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He was still passed out when I sat down against the Pig to rest my eyes."  He breathes heavily.  "Guess that was a pretty bad idea, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “The only bad idea was ours. We should have taken rest directly after returning from the mine. I have more questions for you, but we must find Maouelue first. There is dark magic about. These runes...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter reaches for the rune cloth in his pocket only to recall that it is still in Maouelue’s possession.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Where *is* this cleric?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What cleric?  Oh, right.  We're in Ilmater's parsonage.  If I could get some water, I think I might be able to try to get up."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter hands him what’s left of his waterskin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He drinks sparingly, making sure he doesn't over do.  Douglas winces as he sits up, but then looks surprised and takes the bandage off.  Underneath is a gash neatly knitting itself back together, the blood receding as if being erased.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wow! Thank you friend.  Those bottles are better than gold!  So," he says, getting up, "What should we do now?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then he remembers he has his mess kit in tow. That should do nicely to gather up the parchment ashes. He dares not leave them behind, so he opens up the tin box and brushes the ashes into the cup before resealing and stowing the box in his pack. He still feels oddly compelled by the amulet, but will not sully the good will of the Ilmater by taking it unbidden. He casts a fleeting glance back at the locket, then says to Douglas,</i></p><p>“Let’s go now and find Maouelue...then break our fast while we consider our next course of action.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas gets up gingerly.  Patting himself down, checking to see his inventory, he frowns.  Then smile abruptly as he fishes out a few coins, drops them on the table.  "Not much, but I hope it'll do.  After you!  Oh, I'll have to stop by my rooms to grab a new tunic, too."  He stoops down to pick up his blood sodden shirt.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Are you staying at the Sheep as well? I say, you have followed us unquestioningly into peril in the name of Culver. I would understand if you took your leave of this mess..”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They leave the building and begin walking back to the inn as they continue to converse.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Pinned a message.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, I stay in a barn, southwest of town.  Farmer's real nice.  Since I'm just passing through, I wasn't planning on spending too much money or setting up shop at The Sheep.  I was mainly at the mine most of the time anyways.  If it's all the same to you, I'd like to stick with you guys?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We welcome your company with open arms...and if I could make a casual observation, you seem to have a part to play in this yet. What do you know about those men?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Which ones?!  There seemed to be thugs every time I turned my head!"  He shrugs, good-naturedly.  "The ones in the lady's mirror, I couldn't tell much.  Only know the moustache man vaguely.  Saw the big man at The Pig last night, he had his goons with him.  I recognize them, but I'm not high up enough on any ladder to know names," he chuckles.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There's a lot of people that work for the big man; some that live in town, some that don't.  Either way, seems like he's working for someone, too.  Could be more than one person, but the talk I've heard is that Moustache is the boss.  Nothing gets done without his okay."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I see...let us take care then not to draw attention to ourselves and our mission...though...I suppose I should avoid free ales for a while...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter lowers his head in a show of mild embarrassment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah...  I never got one of those last night!  Too busy...," he starts patting his pockets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Dieter, you didn't happen to see..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You didn't happen to see a piece of parchment paper, big spot of ink on it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I can’t say I have, not unless, well...there was a piece next to you on the table, but...it burned. We...there...was this circle of runes...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter trails off as his eyes cloud over slightly and his complexion darkens a shade.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It burned?  Hmm.  Strange.  And the runes, are they like the ones on the coin I showed you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Coin?...wait...<i>in the mine!</i> I knew I had seen their like...  what do they mean? You mentioned you were searching for them. “</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah, that's the reason some of us were there.  Besides the ore veins.  The big man came up to me one night in the Pig, asked me if I had found any of those coins.  Laid down five gold, said, 'There's more where that came from, bring me more of these coins when you find them,' and that was it.  I have no idea what they are or what they mean.  I don't read runes, and I didn't ask the big man.  He's not an 'answering questions' type, anyways, know what I mean?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter frowns gravely</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dark deeds, runic circles, mystical convergence...we must be wary. Fel things await those who delve too deep into the magical unknowns of this world.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He reflects on something.  "Huh...  I would think those would be the thugs that had Culver, but we saw him with Moustache..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to get the message from the fox here. But I also don’t want to overstep on the storyteller role. What’s the protocol for that kind of thing?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perfect!  I'm contouring the story around you.  We're not in a written adventure at this point, just riffing, so feel free to do what you want.  I have some ideas and hooks for you, but for the most part this is all where you want to go!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter considers this for a moment, his gaze is drawn to a glimmer of blue-white light streaking toward him from down the lane. As it draws nearer, its form becomes clearer. It appears to be a sort of fey fox. It sprints directly to him and holds its mouth slightly agape. He appears to be offering a small scroll held in his trap.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers curiously at the beautiful, unearthly creature and slowly reaches for the roll. As he stretches it out, a second piece of paper falls to the ground. He stoops to pick it up and sees the message “...bring your net...”. With a furtive glance over at Douglas, he quickly reads Maouelue’s message on the larger roll. His gaze lingers on the paper for a beat, then he turns to address Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Douglas, ill tidings from Maouelue at The Sleeping Sheep. Pray, hasten to your rooms and gather what you need then rejoin us at the inn.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Will do, meet you there." He dashes away toward his lodgings.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter walks at a steady pace toward the inn until Douglas is out of view, then he turns and sprints instead to Culver’s shoppe.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he approaches the building, he casts a few furtive glances around, wishing to avoid the watch of any passers by.</i></p>

<p>Dieter scans the scene.  Everything looks the same as you left it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He moves over to where the armoire had been and reaches out, feeling for the cords of his net.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>... he grips them...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Creating some strange tension!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls the net back and folds it up, then straps it on the underside of his pack. He lets out an ice-cold breath through pursed lips, then pulls the wardrobe doors ajar.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wardrobe swings open easily.  The furs are still on the floor of the cabinet.  The man is gone.  On the back wall, just as the previous cloth was hanging by a bolt, you see a piece of parchment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On it, a large ink dot can be seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s form wavers for a moment, his shirt seems to stretch as his body swells slightly. He lets out a furious ROAR before shrinking back down to size again. He takes the bolt and parchment down and tucks them in his pack, then looks about the room and wardrobe again searching for any trace left by someone who could have set this man free. Surely the man could not have escaped without aid...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ooooo...  BIG Investigation check!!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(wooooooooooooooooooooot)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There is it.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In his rage, he searches through the area, trying to find any semblance of how the man could have left or who could have been sneaky enough to pull of the heist.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A green glow surrounds him as he peers into nooks and crannies, checks for footprints or markings, and tries to piece together the events of the man's escape.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a blinding mental flash, Dieter sees a hand drawing the spot on the piece of paper, hands clothed in dark gloves.  You see thin boots, well crafted, Eleven made, stepping lightly over everything, not making any prints.  Whispers of speech come to you, but are immediately hushed.  The speech was common, but the words you cannot hear.  There is a surge of magic as the two beings are together, then they aren't in the area anymore.  You feel as if a magic transportation spell was used.  But the thief didn't use a spell to get in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter gets closer to the wardrobe, hoping to find anything of use to identify these people.  And his eyes fall on a piece of parchment outside of the wardrobe.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
It looks to be a bill of sale, but something strikes Dieter as odd.  He picks up the paper, studying it.  Normal parchment and ink.  Then he reads:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Supply of ropes, cut to size of five feet each, 10 gold.  Order of barrels, wooden, iron banded, made to order, four foot height by three foot diameter at the middle, 25 gold. Branding iron with the lettering RM, 10 gold.  Order of potions, sleeping draughts, bought through (garbled writing), 150 gold.  Signed, Culver.  Purchaser signature, Veena.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Veena...hmm...damn these visions. Damn these entanglements!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He takes the bill of sale and places it alongside the other parchment in his pack. The small muscles around his eyes pulsate with fury. He then dashes out the door making haste toward the inn.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's a cool Pathfinder rule about research and history checks, basically anything a person can study for an hour or so.  Its called a 'Take 20'  where you basically take time to sit with something, pour over and research it, to gain knowledge about it.  I like it because, even if it doesn't give you a short rest or anything, it can serve to propel your exploration forward.  Or we can roll for knowledge of an object or topic, too.  Either way, let me know how Maouelue goes about his task.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue has been tirelessly moving the party's possessions into the drawing room. As he secures the last of the silver and heads back to the burned room, he thanks Kirra and excuses her from her vigil. He takes stock of the ornate chest and the pile of rune-embossed coins. He lowers himself to the ground and folds his legs in a lotus pose and begins to meditate on the items' respective markings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Survival check for how much is still salvageable.  History check for runic knowledge, Intelligence check for the coins.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a good bit of salvageable materials, surprisingly, in the room.  Along with the heads of several shovels and picks, Maouelue finds a few books intact.  Both packs are remarkably still functional, with all of their belongings in them!  Some furniture is able to be fixed, and Kirra has already set to work on fixing them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard sets to meditating, visions keep intruding, and he's not sure what they mean.  Water in a stream.  A dark basement, smelling of mildew.  Creaking wood.  A funny tasting cookie.  A pretty woman in a dark hooded cloak.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then the ring of runes comes into focus, glowing orange-red in the blackness of his meditation.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another rune pops out at him in recognition.  He can now make out <i>R-NEM-R-</i>.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Delving further and further into the meditation, possibly in frustration that he cannot piece together everything at the moment, he loses the thread and the calm fades.  The visions are chased away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Need to afk for now. I will try to throw a few things in here and there if I can.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the wizard comes out of his trance, Dieter appears outside the burned wall, eyes agape at the scene before him. He sees the pile of rune coins and his heart skips a beat. He calls out to Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What the *blazes* has happened here?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue picks up his head slowly</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Is this really the time for fire puns?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Oh...dear...unintentional...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Never mind. I’m in a foul mood. I can’t divine the meaning of these confounded runes...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Douglas...He do you remember the coin he showed us in the mine? The circle of runes we’ve seen, they must all be connected. I was...able to get some information from the brute, but I...couldn’t detain him indefinitely...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter recounts the details of what he found at Culver’s and tells Maouelue about the teleportation and the bill of sale. He conveniently leaves out his mild torture of the brute.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue appears deeply concerned. He relays his proclamation to Denson about forming a guild.</i></p><p><i>Dieter considers this a moment, a bit taken aback at first, then nods.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Yes. We need to grow our support against this cause. Let us hear what the council has to say. Douglas should be by straight way. Perhaps with our collective knowledge we can untangle some of this growing mystery.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two men wait for a few, tidying up and reviewing the bits of information they have collectively.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Around midday, Kirra comes in with foodstuffs and drinks.  Douglas follows shortly after, carrying a large pack on his back.  He has procured a shield as well; a solidly built oaken shield with the crest of the town on it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Hiya fellas!  What's to eat, I'm starving!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group welcomes Douglas and takes a short rest while they take their luncheon and fill him in on their tidings.</i></p>

<p><i>The group finishes their rest and gets up from the table.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Douglas, I think we have left the mine cart at the parsonage. Would you be so kind as to run and bring it hither?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I would like to take our silver and this chest over to the Saynea at the forge.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Kirra, do you expect Denson to be much longer? We would do well to conclude our business in town and continue our search for Culver.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas, still stuffing bacon and biscuits in his pockets for later, says, "Right.  I'm on it," and exits hastily. </p><p>Kirra nods, saying, "He should be back any moment now.  Unless there were other things for the Council to discuss.  They're our elders of the town, and sometimes it takes a bit to get them all together at the same time.  Should be about finished, though, I'd expect."  She smiles at the two of you and continues cleaning the remains of the meal.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter gives a cursory nod then turns back to his vittles. Maouelue’s eyes however, linger a while on Kirra as he smiles back, perhaps a bit more broadly than usual.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two adventurers make themselves comfortable while they await the return of their host.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A couple hours later, Maouelue and Dieter start to get a little worried, Denson still isn't back yet.  Minutes later, you hear loud banging from down the hall, towards the rooms.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both jump up at the sound and immediately go to investigate the sound source.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As they approach the damaged section of the building, hammering and sawing sounds grow louder.  The scene displays itself as a group of burly men handling lumber and tools, working at an extremely fast pace in rebuilding the fire-affected room.  Denson is there, directing the work.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Good Denson! Glad you’re back. Many thanks to fair Kirra for her hospitality while you were away. What news from the council?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Friends!  Looks like we'll have this back up and running in no time, eh?  Glad Kirra was able to assist you gentlemen.  As for the Council," he says, looking around, "let us away to a more secluded spot.  One with less ears, eh?!"   He leads you out of the room and to a locked door past the kitchens.  The room is comfortable for the three, chairs are offered.  Denson pulls a dark brown bottle of something and three glasses. He sets them out on the table, pours a thick amber liquid, and knocks the bottle against them, offering them up.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He swigs his in one, grimaces while he sets the glass back down.  He pours another while he starts talking. </p><p>"There are five elders of the Oakhurst Council.  They are all venerated members of this community; business owners, folks that have lived here their entire lives.  Which says a lot, because we're kind-of known as a transition town.  People come, people go.  Not too man stay, if you catch my drift."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Five make all of the government-type decisions facing the town.  They also tend to know the scuttlebutt before anyone else.  They keep things close to their collective vests, however.  The rest of us just find a way to...  work within their system.  Don't get me wrong, they are fair, good people.  They take a deep responsibility for this town. Their town.  With that being said, they'd like to meet with you.  Tonight, to be to the point."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I said I would ask you fellows.  There's no pressure, you don't have to meet with them if you'd rather not.  I did pass along your message, Master Wizard.  They are...  intrigued.  No one's really expressed interest, especially at this level.  I believe they want to share with you some information to help you...  To help solidify your choice.  Or not.  Guess it's up to you lads."  He smiles and sips at his drink.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue each take their drinks in one and set them down.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We’ll meet them tonight. Could we beg one more small favor of you? There’s a chest in our room over there and we need a hand loading into  our mine cart. We need to head over to the smithy forthwith.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Pardon our haste, but we must not dally. Culver suffers dearly for each passing moment we delay. We have...seen it.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just got the kids to bed. I’d be down to do some more if you want.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, same here.  Such a process!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, you've seen Culver?  And he's hurt?  By all means, take what you need.  But, beggin' your pardon...  There was no chest in that room.  I scoured it thoroughly, and I didn't see a chest of any sort.  Nor any minecart.  I think that might have been a casualty, too.  Again, many apologies lads."</p><p>The chest was made of thick wood with iron bands.  The minecart was made of wooden walls with metal bracing on the bottom and metal wheel parts.  Maouelue found a good amount of metal left after the fire.  No iron bands or wheel bits, though.  The silver ore was strewn over the floor and the coins were in a pile in a puddle of water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oof didn’t see the notifications! Here I come!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Oh you needn’t worry about the cart. We left that down the parsonage last night. Douglas is went to get it and should be back soon. But no chest you say? Hmm. Well, we had best just gather what we can and be on our way. Thanks.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye!  Safe travels.  Oh, and be wary of the Muhlen sisters.  They can be... trying."  He smiles and ushers you out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As they open the door to leave, they see Douglas coming down the road with the cart and they proceed with the loading of all their possessions. As they do, they ask Denson if they can pay him some silver for his troubles.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Many thanks, gentlemen."  He bows to you both.  "Anything I can do to help, please let me know."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Quick clarification, did the rune coins disappear with the other stuff, or did we retain that? Been. A lot of prose today XD )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also how much silver did Denson take?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How much did you want to give him?!)</p><p>(You have a pile of rune coins and no chest...  Plus maybe one other one that you got from Douglas.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I kind of wanted to pay him a bit for damages. Not sure what seems reasonable, but maybe I’ll give him 5 nuggets)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group, eager to get on their way, pushes the cart quickly to the forge and seek Saynea to check on the status of their custom orders.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That'll work!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to get my weapons and kill bad guys now hahaha)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party makes their way to the smithee, minecart in tow.  The same steady hammering can be heard as before, however it has more pronounced notes.  Saynea is smoothing out some bits of Dieter's sword edge, forming the bevels and tempering it.  She looks up as the group comes in, and she smiles.</p><p>"Hoy there!  Glad you could stop by today!  Got some things to show you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I’m glad to hear it! There are foul folk about that I would have help us break these in!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She takes the large silver spheres out, shows them to Maouelue for his inspection.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes them in hand and looks over the smooth silver orbs.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “You are a fine craftswoman indeed Saynea. They are perfect!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bows her head. "Thank you kindly!  Here is the mold, as promised.  Any time you need more, come on back in."</p><p>"And for you," she says to Dieter, "I'm almost finished with the sword end."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The totem will take a couple more days."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If you'd like, leave your staff and I can finish it and affix it in a couple more hours?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Time of day check)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(After midday.  Maybe 2-3ish?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Begging your pardon, but could we leave this cart in your possession? It is a bit much for us to push around in our haste. You would be welcome to use some of the silver to indulge your professional creativity should you be so inclined.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She slowly nods, "Sure, and thank you for the trust.  I'll put this in the back room for safety."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group load out the rune coins and pack enough silver to be wise for the road. About 25 nuggets each.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We will return in a few hours as requested. How late will you be here?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles, "I'll be here when you get back."  She twirls her hammer and starts back to working on your sword attachment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With a nod, they move off down the road. Dieter, in a hushed voice, suggests that they head back to Trix. He tells them he would like to have her scry again using these strange parchments and coins as a focus.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>Selection timed out or was cancelled.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s face begins to elongate strangely and his body begins to bend at the midriff, his proportions oddly shifting as his clothing and gear merge into his shifting skin. A moment later where he had stood, there is now a large black stallion. Who neighs and beckons Douglas and Maouelue towards his back in an apparent bid to get them to mount.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas takes a step back, eyes wide, stammering.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I knew you had magic, but..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Heh, he does like a show of his magic now and then, doesn’t he...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye."  He'll go to pat Dieter Stallion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Have you never seen a Druid transformation before? It is truly one of the sights to behold in this world.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Never."  Standing in awe, he thinks for a moment, then says, "Are we really going back to the forest right now?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “It is indeed a bit of a surprise to me, but we have some time before we return to Saynea and then take our meeting with the council. Would you offer an alternative?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter Stallion lets out a snort and kicks his hind hooves at the dirt.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas looks from the horse to the wizard, then back again.  "No, yeah.  Yeah, that's okay.  We can go, that's...  Yeah, that's okay.  Let's go!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gives him what he thinks is an understanding look.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Heh, I remember my first Druid ride...You’re in for a treat.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both hop on, Douglas a bit gingerly and requiring a hand up, then Dieter Stallion accelerates to a canter and heads out of town towards the forest.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you head out of town, farmers wave and double take at the stallion.  You pass the animals in the field again.  There are even a few farm-hands out this time.  As you get closer to the forest route, Dieter, having been through the trail before, picks up the track fairly easily.  There are a couple twists, but he remembers to look for the blood on the trees, and the arrows pointing the way.   A short time later, the group comes into view of the ramshackle homestead of Bellatrix.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just as Douglas hops down from the druid, and arrow flies by his head, narrowly missing piercing his skull.  It embeds itself in the tree just beyond him, and a rapid series of sticks breaking can be heard from where you all just passed by.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to end it on a cliffhanger tonight.  I promise I'll get to more fighting as we go on!)</p>

<p>Combat ended.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s rage begins to fade. As he looks at the dead woman, a pang of sadness intrudes before he steels himself to attempt lowering the body down through the bramble wall.</i></p>

<p>As you look down, you see inside the walls of the thorn wall.  Bellatrix and Douglas are there, Douglas is wrapped in a gauze of some kind.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue moves his hands in a  sort of air dance as a large transparent hand extends out of his. He sends the mage hand up toward Dieter.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Sure! I’ll lend you a hand!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The body is guided down.  Halfway down, the swords fall away from the hands.  They land with a soft <i>thump</i> on the forest floor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes a look at Douglas and Bellatrix and sees that Maouelue is already heading over to assist in what way he can. Dieter begins scouring the fallen assassin for clues to her origin and anything else that might be useful. He carefully inspects the swords, crossbow, and bolts.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She has a plethora of fun things.  Two shortswords of poisoning.  A light crossbow.  A elven made cloak (Arcana check, or attune to it for specs.)  Her headscarf also gives her advantage on stealth checks.  There are plenty of bolts, none are poisoned yet.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’ll be in and out here for a bit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Same here, no worries!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't really tell what exactly it does, but it does track as magical.  She also has a bandolier about her torso, filled with about fifteen different vials.  All of them are various poisons.  (Intelligence check to see what they might be.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter picks up the gear and begins to stow what he can, then calls out to Maouelue to come over when he has a chance.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The leather armor is cut through, would need some repairs.  Lastly, she has elven boots (Arcana check or attunement.)</p><p>(Do you take anything off, namely the headscarf?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter begins removing the worn armor and asks Maouelue for his professional opinion on the magical items.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yuk)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I...I...don’t know. I think we should get out of the open and move these prone bodies into the hut.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix comes over to you both.  You can see she's come through an opening in the side of the thicket-wall.  </p><p>"If you're done with the body, I would like to move whomever it is into the circle of..."  She looks down at the body, gasps, and puts her hands over her mouth.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “What is it Bellatrix?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"This...  This is Veena Muhlen.  She's one of the Five.  She owns the general store with her sister, Hozieh."  She looks shocked, horrified.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “For the love of...why?...why would she try to assassinate one of our number? We were supposed to meet with them this very night! Is there aught we can do to help her? Is she truly....dead?”

<p>After a check, Maouelue bends deeply to her head, checking to see if there is any sign of life.  Amazingly, the wizard senses shallow, wheezing breathing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter is watching this scene anxiously. He considers for a moment then reaches for the half potion in his bag. He unstoppers it and begins pouring the liquid into Veena’s mouth one drop at a time.</i></p><p>“If she wakes...don’t let her move. Trix...what of our man Douglas?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Douglas is no longer a part of this world.  He has passed on.  I did all I could for him."  She looks back to the grove momentarily, then back to the scene at hand.  "He will be interred here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Damn my *haste*! Damn this foul treachery! What is the meaning of all this!?!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman on the ground stirs fractionally.  Barely breathing, the blood at least is staunched and color comes back to her face.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The vines come out very quickly, surprising the woman on the ground and securing her completely.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A beat later, she starts laughing hoarsely.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Tell me...Veena, what business does one of the council of five have as an assassin? What grudge do you have with me...and my man who you have so *cravenly murdered*?

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You say craven, I say... business.  This is nothing from the Council.  We're very much looking to speak with you both later."  Her eyes are still closed, but she is smiling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Business? Oh really...And what of your *business* with me? What was it now? *Wizard.  Witch.  My fight is not with either of you.  If you tell me where the druid is, so I may kill him as well, then I'll be on my way.*”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Check your pocket before you spit your venom, or repeat my words back to me."  Eyes still shut, still smiling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, without letting his eyes leave Veena, pulls out the ink splotched parchment from his pocket.</i></p><p>“You mean this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She opens an eye.  Then both.  Smiles back at you, then winks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Have something in your eye? Just <i>what</i> about this carnage and evil is quite so funny to you?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The fact that you think you can get information from me.  The fact that, even though you're holding that, you have no idea what it means.  The fact that I got caught by amateurs and you didn't kill me outright.  There's <i>plenty</i> to find humorous."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh the latter can be arranged wench...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls out his scimitar and holds it to her throat.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix cries out, "No, you musn't!  There are horrible consequences if she loses her life by either of you now."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She hestiates.  "I might have an alternate option."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Oh I’m *all* ears...we came to this town and offered our good will and services, but have been met with naught but deceit and death...Please, illuminate us.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “My companion speaks true. Though he be a bit...bipolar...he is an honest Druid seeking fair justice.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "The best would be for the Five to see what she did, have all three of us vouch for the situation, and give her justice to them.  I can bind her in a Forcecage, she will not be able to escape.  I can watch over her while you both go back and bring the Council here.  We can explain everything to them."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “...and what oath can you take that will prove your honesty in this matter?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Yes, your offer seems to be just but...treachery appears to lie around every corner in these lands. The past two days have not instilled us with confidence...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks shocked at the accusation.  Then visibly composes herself, although with an effort.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'm used to having people distrust me. I understand.  What oath could I give you that you could trust?  I've already helped you with potions.  I could swear something in magic, if you would like?  If either of you are able to do something to that effect?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Aye...you have shown aid to our cause...forgive us. Seeing our companion fall by the hand of this...wretch...the shock is fresh. You seem to be an agent of life rather than death. We will trust you. I will pray that it is not to our doom.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We came hence to ask you to scry once more...upon these artifacts.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hands her the parchment and a runed coin.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue regards the scent with intense apprehension and caution, searching for any tell of deceit.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix takes the items, looking forlornly at Dieter.  "I will help you in this.  We need to finish with Veena, first.  After we decide on what to do with her, we can make time for another scry.  I will only be able to do one more today.  May I ask, are these yours or no?"</p>

<p>(God this is so much fun! Cate and I are watching The Two Towers so I’m in full fantasy mode hahah )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Faintly, in Maouelue's mind, he hears, <i>"There is much to magic.  Life and death are inexorably linked.  I appreciate them both equally."</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Glad you're digging it, sir!!  Great movie.  Have you seen the Hobbit Peter Jackson movies?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue involuntarily mutters under his breath, “Yes...balance in all things...equal measure...a perfect node of truth in between...”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah! We just went through the hobbit movies again before lotr)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Even though they wrangles three movies out of it, I still liked it.  The best fight scene I've ever seen - save maybe the Minas Tirath battle - is the barrel escape.  With Legolas jumping everywhere are shooting everything in sight.  Amazing!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Perform the binding. But first, let us double our check and leave this...assassin...with no more tricks in her sleeves.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter proceeds to search her for any boot daggers or hidden vials and the like.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No boot daggers (that would have been cool, though!  C'mon Joe, write a better villain...), the bandolier is off of her, along with all of her equipment.  Didn't get her leather armor off, though.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "Your spell will quit when mine starts, you should feel it.  My cage will only last an hour, though, so retrieving the Council will have to be quick.  I will not be able to cast it again."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter scowls.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bind her while we regain our strength. I will take her to the council myself. I would have you come with us...so willing.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh... I...  can.  If you prefer."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes. I will risk no more surprise. Maouelue, come, let us recover an hour and consider what we have seen.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Bellatrix...do you require anything more of us before we retire?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I will pack some things.  However, I do travel light.  Let me step inside.  We require Douglas to remain... uninterred, correct?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “For now...believe me, I would not were there *time*”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He will be sealed inside the thorn wall, but the carrion birds...  They will have access.  If we hurry, it should be fine.  I will make haste."   She picks up her skirts and runs to her home.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>I have sent help to your PMs.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix returns with a small pack, using a staff to guide her steps.  The staff is gnarled, twisted, the top is a mess of brambles, nettles, and thorns curving in on itself to form an imperfect spheroid.  "All set.  I've set wards on my home.  Give me a moment to do the same for Douglas's resting place, and I will create the Forcecage for Veena.  Then we will away."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She waves her hands toward the wall of thorns, a shimmering like a heat haze settles on the structure.  Next she turns to Veena.  Her irises turn a milky white, she points her fingers at the woman.  A darkly wavering set of ethereal walls appear around the prone woman, her vine bonds drop away.  She stands and puts out a tentative hand to the dark magic wall.  She recoils as if bitten and looks darkly at the other woman.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"She will not be able to leave."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Have to start driving. I'll be on more later.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a worry, safe travels to you and the fam, sir.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>!Sheet</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party takes a short rest while Bellatrix prepares her spells and seem to understand a lot more about their lives thereafter. Though still a bit tired, they carry on with their mission.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party makes haste through the forest and into Oakhurst.  Bellatrix says, "Although I know the way to certain people in the Five, I would be... unwelcome calling upon them.  Do you know who you would like to speak with first?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “If there is time, I need to pick up my staff from the forge, then...do you know who the head of the council is?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Yes...come to think of it, we do not now the names of any bar...this fiend.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He scowls at Veena.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Did you take Veena with the group, or is she back at Trix's?)</p><p>"Yes, and no.  There is no head of the Five, they're all equally powerful, within the town as well as in the group.  There is Bazad Dunnol, the tanner.  Rhahlad Boste, he owns the coster.  Vam Stuniz is a wonderful horse trainer, he also works with a variety of farm animals, he's fairly popular with the citizenry.  Then there's Hozieh and Veena."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I did if that’s possible in her stasis.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter doesn’t trust any of these people and he didn’t want to take any chances.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think the original idea was that she would be in the spell cage for the short rest and they would bind her for the way back.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do you have a map of this at all?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The map of the town is pinned - the upper right hand corner.  I could specify what they are.  How would the party be transporting Veena?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was thinking after the short rest Dieter would turn back into a horse and they would bind her to his back.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Had a question about the level up during short rest as well. They both learned new spells,  it I think I accidentally switched the prepared spells and I may not be allowed in a short rest. What’s your call on that?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That'll be fine.  Since we're doing xp leveling you should be able to add the spells and such whenever you hit the level.  You'll need to long rest for the hp and the spell slots to be available.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(perf)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gonna check the map real quick and make a route plan here)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We'll go to Maester Stuniz. I'll trust meself a horsemaster ere a tanner any day. Do you think the two of you can get her there while I meet with Saynea and rejoin quickly thereafter?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes, I can take you there."  (If you'd rather not rp the blacksmith trip, we can just say you went there & picked up the bit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(To give you an idea of what I was thinking for these two custom weapons, I wanted each of the characters to pour their meditations into them over time with each rest, focusing on infusing them with their own magical essence as they grow. I want the bladestaff to synergize with the Shelleliegh and that it might have a slash attack and a bludgeon attack. The orbs, Maouelue would focus a different magical bias into each of them over time and practice balancing them in his left hand as an offhand/source item. The silver was with a nod to making them anti undead or armor or whatever is canon in this world.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(also let me know if i'm a crazy person!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group is anxious as they approach the ranch, looking around and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of all the animals.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter seems as calm as he has in a while in the midst of the beast party.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue looks as if he is bracing for a snowstorm.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a crazy person!  How would you like the meditations to work?  As a combat boon or hp aid, something else?  The blade can give the quarterstaff an extra 1d6 slashing, you'll have to roll that separately.  I was thinking with or without the Shillelagh, but it's up to you on that.  The three silver orbs - that'll be cool!  The silver is... an interesting situation.  I've already thrown out the idea of were-animals only being affected by silver weapons.  Or else your fight in the Mountain's Toe Gold Mine would have gone...  very poorly!  I'd like to maybe add a die roll if the creature you're attacking is undead, maybe an extra 1d6?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That all sounds totally on point. I'm messing around with the avrae aliasing stuff and i also saw you can get a bunch of extra commands from the serveralias pages etc. At some point i'll try to make a shortcut for some of it, but LMK what numbers you think are fair and I'll try to use that info.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(re: Shillelagh, that spell was kind of core to why i wanted to make the weapon, so whatever doesn't seem OP that can use that would be great.)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The meditations would just be like over time we maybe discover new techniques or empower some aspect of it with enough focused training.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool cool!  Shillelagh is one of my favorite spells.  I dig that aspect of the meditation, too.  Let me know what you're thinking and we'll check it out.  Before we get started on this next part, I gotta get some sleep!  It's been a long weekend, WAY too much yardwork!!  I'll start up the rp and - hopefully - encounters first thing tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yay! Thanks man! I may tinker with the bot a bit more in here. Looking forward to the morn!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I'm so bad with this recently, I'm sorry!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I hear you're starting in on the Ravenloft today, too, eh?!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The quartet walk down the street,  the woman in the cage draws almost all of the attention.  Whispers flit back and forth between shop patrons and the rabble that roam through town.  There aren't a lot of people, but you feel that it probably doesn't matter, this is going to be the hot gossip today.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>After a quick stop by the blacksmith's shop to procure Dieter's staff attachment (which is a beautiful counterpoint to the sliver death accompanying the opposite side of the staff now), the group heads Southeast, to a substantial group of farmland.  Rows of crops sway in the autumnal breeze as farm hands work with various animals.  An interesting addition, A group of rothe' roam the pasture past the waving grain.   These buffalo-type creatures typically come from the north, and it takes a practiced hand to raise them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group plods deeper into the farm, you see a very dark-skinned man, wide brimmed hat in his hands, talking to a rothe', soothingly.  The man has curly white hair, balding a bit on the top.  Smile lines crease his face, and it's no surprise, he's grinning while talking to the large creature next to him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He turns to notice the four people traveling towards him, smiles wider, and makes his way to you after patting the beast on it's rump.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I was wondering when I would have a chance to run into you folks," he says, winning smile possibly going even wider.  "Heard a lot about what you've done for the town already, and what you're planning on doing. Might fine, migh-ty fine.  This little place's been waiting for men like you, been saying it for years, isn't that right Bellatrix?  It's right nice to see you as well, ma'am."  And he gives a little bow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dang didn't even see this until now, but look at this fanciness...)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Always glad to meet the acquaintance of one so skilled with animals. I've got a special relationship with beasts myself. Master Stuniz, I presume?"

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(NICE!!  Well done, sir!  Did that take a lot of coding, or were you able to get a script?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I've been coding that for a while now. Lots of hurdles to get over, but I think I'm getting a hang of it now.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Please, please, call me Vam.  No one calls me anything but, I won't let 'em!"  He laughs heartily.  "Now, what can I do for the Heroes of Oakhurst, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The tricky bit was being able to add the name argument so I could have Mao use Dieter's spellcasting modifier like the cantrip specifies.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow, yeah, just noticed that...  Extremely impressive!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Vam, I'm afraid we bring fel tidings. Veena here before you beset us by ambush just outside faithful Bellatrix's door. We went in search of information about the dark deeds plaguing the town. I shudder even now to think what has befallen poor Culver. Veena saw fit to assassinate our companion Douglas, then attempt to flee. We were most surprised to find a member of the five under the hood when we laid her low...We would serve this town in honesty and good will, but this was a shock unexpected."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His smile falters, fades.  </p><p>"Wait, what did you say?"</p><p>He tries to see past you to the cage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seeing Veena, he's shocked.  He looks between the four of you, trying to understand what he's seeing.</p><p>"I don't understand.  She killed someone?  When did this happen?  How?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Do you tell Vam everything, or do you hold some thing(s) back?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party informs Vam of the events in the forest, withholding that they carry her possessions for now.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They also conveniently leave out the part about nearly setting the forest ablaze.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks sternly at the group.  "Well, I have to admit...  Not too sure what to make of all this.  I have quite a bit of history, professionally, with this woman, as most of the town does.  This sounds just like one of them fairy tales, I just can't believe Veena could be capable...  Have you told anyone else?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye, we are taken aback as well and equally unsure. We've not told anyone perse, but there were some onlookers as we came into town, though whether she was recognized I cannot say. My companion and I lack the ability to pierce any illusion at play here. Thus we seek council from the rest of the...ahem...Council..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue fidgets idly with his triumvirate of sliver orbs while the converse.</i></p><p><i>Dieter idly thumbs the contours of his newly-crafted eagle totem.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A-yuh, that sounds about right, we need to convene immediately."  He dons his hat.  "Lemme check on some things at the house, I'll put a word out to everyone to meet.  There is a building we use as the Council meeting area, but I'm afraid it's not available at the moment.  We'll just have to have them come here, does that work for y'all?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group nods in assent. Everyone is nervous, but this seems an amicable accord thus far. Eyes remain open, but guard is lowered ever slightly.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, one more thing," he says, tightening his gaze on the Maouelue, Dieter, and Bellatrix.  "This Douglas.  You, uh...  You still have the body?  Because if you do, I'd say we might want to bring him here, post-haste."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue glances at Bellatrix.</i></p><p>"We...had not time to intern it, but we have tried to secure it best we could. It's back at Trix's. Might should we head there together once the council is joined?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell you what," he turns and whistles at a nearby farm hand on a horse.  "One of you can go with Heston here and retrieve the body.  We might start without you, but no one is going to do anything without seeing Douglas's body."  With that, he makes a clicking sound with his cheek, nods to you all, and runs into the farmhouse at  good pace.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter obliges and makes great haste as he reassures Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Right. Let's get the council."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you enter the farmhouse, there are a couple older boys receiving orders from Vam.  </p><p>"Go round them up and bring them back here, double time.  Git going."</p><p>The boys dash out the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's fiddling becomes more intense as they wait. Creeping cryogenic crystals begin to form on the orbs' surfaces, stretching out from frosty fingertips.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam doesn't see.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gazes around the farmhouse, taking in his surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A handful of minutes pass.  A knock comes at the door and an older man with broad shoulders and a bald head peeks in.  His hands are large, gnarly, he's still wearing a smock of slick leather.  His face is lined, worn.  He looks extremely worried and says, "Vam, what's all this about needing to meet right away?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sizes the man up with a glance.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sees a very nicely kept homestead.  Plain wood beams and walls cover the interior, sawdust is on the floor.  Everything looks worn but very naturally so.  There are saddles hung over a bannister that leads to a cellar, it seems.  There is a second floor as well.  The main floor of the house is one big room, encompassing kitchen, sitting room, dining area, and foyer all in one.  There is a small hallway off to the right of the wizard, which ends with a couple doors, one on either side of the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks capable of handling himself in a fight, he's burly, strong.  He exudes an air of timidity, though.  Other than that, Maouelue doesn't get a real solid vibe about him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Greetings good sir. Maouelue is my name. It is well that you could come on such notice. You have my thanks."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks tentatively from Vam to you, very timid, very nearly backs out of the doorway.  Vam waves the big man in, and he stops his retreat.  He says, "Mm...  My name is Bazad.  I'm here for the Council meeting."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Well met."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods, shakes your hand rather quickly, then goes over to speak with Vam.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue casts a glance at Bellatrix and takes note of the increasing awkwardness of Veena's caged form.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He moves semi-casually to obscure it from immediate view.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check about Veena.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another knock on the door.  A portly, middle-aged man comes in while he's knocking.  He wears a sense of importance like a cloak.  You get the sense he might have been muscular at one time, but he's let that go for quite a while.  </p><p></p><p>He strides in, making eye contact with Vam and Bazad, then says loudly, "Who in the hell called this meeting.  I know Vam couldn't have been this idiotic, so who's responsible for taking me away from my business?  And at closing time, nonetheless?"  His eyes fall on the wizard and the witch.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “In a way you might say one of *you* called this meeting.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A realization hits Maouelue as a mental flash...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Veena has not moved or blinked since she's been caged.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What the hell does that mean?!"  He looks around from person to person, arms flailing in the air.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Forgive my being cryptic. Our company, such as it is, was attacked by one of your number, here. A man has been slain by her hand."
*He gestures at Veena, realizing he can't dodge the issue much longer, and seeking to get out in front of it.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Fear not her cage. She has been placed in stasis in order that we might secure her from flight."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"And I beg your pardon sir, I go by the name of Maouelue. My partner Dieter has gone with some of Vam's hands to retrieve...our friend's body."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What?..."  The portly man stares incredulously at you.  He and Bazad come over to the cage, with Vam behind.  They are awestruck at their unblinking friend behind bars of energy.</p><p>"I don't understand, what in the hell is going on here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam explains to the group what the three heroes told to him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He ends and a small voice comes through the doorway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That's a lie.  My sister would do no such thing."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue turns, startled.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And through the doorway steps a matronly looking woman.  Her clothes give off an air of being of money, old money, but maybe not much is left anymore.  She saunters in, glides.  If you though the other man had an air of importance, it's nothing compared to Hozieh Muhlen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "If what you say is true, then this must not be your sister..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He gestures grandly at Veena-in-cage.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Red satin, deep crimson velvet, and black lace adorn the petite body, and make a strange non-cohesion to her heavily made-up face.  As if they're fighting each other for relevance, the two styles are at war with your senses.  She comes across as old but trying to be young, but also young trying to pass as courtly and on-in-years.  It is a very odd feeling, and for those not used to her presence, Hozieh Muhlen makes people feel... strange.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She very stately strides over to the cage, aware that all eyes are on her.  As she approaches the Forcecage, she holds her hand out.  Bellatrix starts to warn her, Hozieh's eyes dart to the witch and Bellatrix goes still, silent.  All watch as the sisters reach for each other.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thunder crashes in the distance, and a streak of white hot light flashes, searing everyone's eyes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue blinks rapidly bidding his vision to return as quickly as possible. He searches about with the butt of his staff trying to reestablish his surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two women...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This is some amazing coding!  Nicely done.  I wonder if it can still target when in initiative order?  We can try, if you'd like; sim an encounter?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The power went out another three times last night.  The last one was for four hours.  Not my night, I was super bummed to have to cut it like that.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah dude. I haven’t figured out targeting yet, but would love to put it together. Honestly it may end up being easier to build it in Beyond and just update. Does the shillelaghs enchant +slashing seem OP?</p><p></p><p>A bit of a bummer, but also a fun cliffhanger.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(A bit, but that just means I throw harder things at you!  The assassin was a higher level, you seemed to do just fine with that 😀)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Seems to be the biggest problem with the homebrew content, no one site deals with it well.  Beyond is very much pay-to-play, and they don't allow outside sources.  Discord seems fine, as long as you have some coding background, but the more particular things might be tough.  Roll20 is cool, a bit more user friendly as point-and-click goes.  But even with them, you have to shell out for the pre-set options.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Gotcha. I was thinking maybe the slashing attack doesn’t get the spell modifier added? It could also maybe be a d4 damaged roll etc. until I skill myself up with it.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Another thought was that it could require a bonus action to apply the phantom hit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That's not bad, either.  Might be tougher to write into the script, but it could be a separate attack altogether.  How about this - just like with a one-handed versus two-handed versus a thrown weapon, it would depend on how you're attacking.  If you want to use the blade to slash, you go with that attack.  The bludgeoning could be a wholly separate series of attacks, and maybe if you wanted to do a double attack, your meditation from the previous day could allow for that?  Get a meditation point system going, or something of the like?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That is sounding pretty cool. The idea of meditating charges/slots for special attack seems like a nice balance and could potentially work with the orbs too. There could also be some skill element where if he uses the double attack he has a chance to cut himself for 1d4 with the blade end haha)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That's for when you roll a 1!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And the two women...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Are no longer there.</p><p>Everyone looks around in astonishment.  No one more so than Bellatrix, who is still holding the Forcecage solid.  There are no rips or tears, she is frantically searching for what went wrong.</p><p>Just then, a horse neighs out front, Heston and Dieter enter the house carrying the wrapped body of Douglas.</p><p>Heston asks Vam, "Pardon, boss.  Where do you want us to put this?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(all my testing has led me to completely miss this actual progression lolol)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Dieter...what timing...the Muhlen sisters have just disappeared!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He fills Dieter in on what he missed, then turns to address the crowd.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What does the council make of this sorcery?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They are dumbfounded, looking on the cage with astonishment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Bellatrix, what fearsome magicks might have the power to perform such an act?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix is still moving frantically over the cage, trying to find out what went wrong.  She starts emitting a low whining moan, which picks up the more frantic she gets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nothing!" she screams.  "Nothing can break free from a Forcecage!  That is one of my most powerful spells..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rest of the Five go to inspect the body.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers into the eyes of each of the remaining council members imploring them to speak up should they have any knowledge of the sisters' intentions.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They are uncomfortable, Bazad looks as if he'd like to find a reason to leave.  They start inspecting the body of Douglas.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't really tell if they're hiding anything or not.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Friends...councilmen, will you aid us in the pursuit of these treacherous creatures? If not, how long before it is your shop that is ransacked, or your heart poisoned with a fetid arrow?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He pulls out the bandolier of poison vials and gestures to Douglas' corpse.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How many more honest townsfolk need to die to serve the ends of this pestilent sorcery!?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Will you join us in our aim to consolidate the strength of this town? Will you assent to a guild of vigilant watchers? Would you see this evil undone!?!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look abashed, Bazad hangs his head.  Vam stands, saying, "A lot of things just happened right now.  I don't doubt that you have the best interests at heart, and we truly appreciate what you've done here."  He takes a deep breath.  "It seems to me that there is some treachery that has been happening right under our noses."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The portly man starts to object, but Vam speaks up, "Now, listen Rhal, you know as well as I do there have been some strange happenings for a good time now.  Matter of fact, the <i>supposed</i> culprit is standing right here in this room.  I'm not saying all of the facts are on the table, but there's enough for me to say this whole town, and <i>especially</i> the Council, needs to make a formal apology to Ms. Bellatrix here."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix's body sags as she releases her Forcecage.  She looks tired, haggard even.  She also looks extremely scared.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two heroes nod in approval of this sentiment, having been aided by Bellatrix without question several times now.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "My company must take rest soon, and I suggest we move elsewhere ere nightfall. Is there somewhere safe we would sup and discuss before taking our bed for the night?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You can feel free to rest and eat here.  Don't have much, or anything fancy, but there's plenty of beans and bread, at least tonight.  And there's a room at the end of the hall with space for some bedrolls.  What else for food...  there's the inn, and, of course, The Pig and Falcon.  I have to take care of this body, fellas.  We'll make sure he has a proper burial after we've gone over it for evidence.  Bellatrix, could you assist us, please dear?"</p><p>Vam goes over to check on the witch, and gently leads her over to Douglas.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue and Dieter come over and watch make a strange F-shaped gesture to pay their last respects to Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The men comb over the body, checking the wounds and the poison stains around his mouth.  They get a very detailed description of the fight with the assassin from Bellatrix.  Ultimately, move the body into the yard and Bellatrix goes about preparing Douglas for burial.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad approaches the two adventurers.  "You gentlemen decided where to sup, yet?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let us take our meal here and rest. There is much to discuss.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"True, there is much to discuss."  He leads you both to the dining area, where a sturdy table with six seats are stands empty.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue sit down</i></p><p>“We would hear the wisdom of the council. Ere we lay our course. What make you all of this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad makes a showing of offering you seats, then sits after you, playing a gracious host.</p><p>"Well, to be sure, today was one hell of a day.  I'm still not sure I'm not dreaming or not!"  He guffaws, looking around at the others.  Seeing no one is in a jovial mood, his demeanor darkens a bit.  </p><p>He then says, "Listen, there's bad business done here today.  To you, to the townfolks of Oakhurst.  To that young woman out there tending to your friend.  That happened some time ago, actually."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It all starts with missing children in the town.  A whole mess of them went missing, and we just couldn't find out what was happening to them.  When we sent out for help to other towns around the area, they reported the same thing happening.  Obviously, the Council got to work speaking with everyone, sometimes seven or eight times.  I feel we did our due diligence.  And, no matter who we talked to, the finger always pointed at Trix, there."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"She was always the black sheep of the community.  Everyone knew she practices magic.  At one time, our little town was very anti magic.  There was an impassioned plea from Trix's family, and we started turning our minds around, slowly to be sure.  Then someone showed us the black art that she deals in, and, well, one thing lead to another.  She was run out of town.  I do believe this is the first time she's set foot in Oakhurst in several years."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Looking back on it, there probably were signs of what the Muhlen's had up their sleeves.  They were very secretive with each other, to be sure.  How in the hell were we supposed to know they were evil, though?  They've been pillars of the community.  The general store they run is beyond remonstration; they are fantastic business people and generous members of the Council."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam speaks up, "What about the vote on these boys' idea, huh?  We should have pressed them more, there.  Should have known something was foul.  Wasn't the first time on that, neither."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam spits out the door, into the dusty walkway.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “The dread hands of the devil are oft dressed in decorum...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Justice lies just beyond the ice...it’s an old frost mage thing he taught me.”
*Dieter elbows Maouelue gently.*
Maouelue: “Indeed...”
Dieter: “We must gain reconnaissance of this town and its surroundings. Let it be known we will not tolerate the treachery of the Muhlen sisters in this town of Oakhurst nor those complicit. Maouelue and I have suspicion that there might be secrets hiding in the greater Kratos Hill Mine, but lack for a more general intelligence of the area. Please, be our guide in this manner.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let the juicy ice of justice flow into the heart of the mountain!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Rhahlad: "Kratos Hill, eh?  No idea about that.  All I've ever heard about that place is that it was used by a band of smuggler a long time ago.   A few of the younger men tried their hands at the silver ore trade for a while, but nothing too great came from it.  Might have gone to bigger towns, if they had found anything, come to think of it.  What about you, Bazad.  Anything to add?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bazad shakes his head, still looking uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Vam: "A-yuh, I can second that.  Lots of ghost stories about miners coming back from the dead and smugglers attacking anyone looking for their hidden treasure."  He laughs.  "Mostly told to keep the kids around here from doin' anything stupid.  Do you think Kratos Hill and the Muhlan sisters have something in common?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “It’s these coins...these runes...they keep appearing at all of these incidents. Culver, Douglas, the mine...and something Veena said about this...”
*He lays down the ink splotched parchment along with a few of the runic coins.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look down at the parchment.</p><p>Rhahlad starts guffawing.</p><p>Bazad looks like he's going to be sick.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam scratches his head.  "Am...  Am I missing something.  What is that?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad says, "It's some childish prank!  Who gave that to you, seriously?!  That's the best joke I've ever seen, ha.  You boys are all right...  Ah.  I needed that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party looks at the two men’s reactions with interest.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Is it a prank that one of these burst into flames in my pocket? Is it a prank that a man I had detained disappeared leaving only one of these behind in his stead?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “If any of you know more of these runes I would have you speak of it. Now.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A pale blue comes over the wizard’s eyes as he says this.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad stops laughing immediately.  "Whoa, whoa, I meant no offense, gentlemen, honestly I didn't.  I've no idea what you'd been through, don't blame me if i thought you were putting us on with this."  He taps the paper.</p><p>Looking back and forth between the four others, he says, "You all seriously don't know what this is?  The 'black spot'?  You've never heard the old sailor's tales of the 'black spot'?</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I suppose it’s high tide we did...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bazad and Vam look on in confusion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I come from the coast, but traverse the seas by...different means.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  that's fair.  Story's simple really, there're tales about pirates receiving this same mark, parchment with a ink spot on it, when they're marked for death.  I thought it was a mere child's story..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “...sadly...that tracks with our experience...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam shakes his head, studies the parchment again.  </p><p>"Can you point out the runes, here?  I don't see anything like that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s fingers glow white as he twirls his triumvirate with increasing vigor.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “The coins...look at the coins. We also...have seen this circle in dreams.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p><i>The darkness opens onto an entrance.  Runes are etched, but these are not the ones you're searching for.  There are many hazards here, many ways to die.  You enter and pass rooms, pass through hallways untouched by human eyes for generations.  You come upon a large hall, filled with statues holding up the ceiling.  These enormous statues depict lizardfolk in battle.  Victorious over their foes.  A strange feeling comes over you as you turn to see more lizardfolk around you, but these are not statues.  These are snake-people...  Snakes with humanoid features.  Arms on some, legs on others.  All with scales or some semblance of leathery hide.  They take you and tie you to the dias at the end of the big hall.  They pierce your side, let the blood run down the dias into a pool.

<p>(So after all that aliasing I just decided to create the heirloom item stuff on dndbeyond and sync it. Take a look at the attacks/descriptions when you have a second. I think I’ve made it pretty balanced, but let me know what you think and we can chat about progression.)</p>

<p>(Should the hit be tied to the normal attack and the slowed status be on the save or something like that? I was just tinkering with the save throw. Feel free to edit)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Took the con save off frosty ball. What do you think about the Cyclone Slash? Dex save mech ok? Damage and long rest reset seem fair?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(My thought for the bladestaff attacks is that it’s a versatile weapon and the bludgeoning attacks will benefit from shillelagh, while the blade attacks are finesse, so they will use my dex instead.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cyclone slash same as the frosty ball, however we can keep the Con save and say that it throws whomever it hits if they fail the save.  You can decide how far they're thrown, we'll set that as a separate roll.  Good thought on the bladestaff, that is exactly what I was envisioning as well!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two magic users waken at first light, their eyes feeling somewhat heavier than usual. They each rise, stretch, and take care of their morning usuals. They each then take their newly crafted heirlooms outside into the morning light and dew for a spot of meditation and exercise. As they pose and twirl about in the sunbeams, the silver of their weapons twinkles and bends the light into waving spectra cascading over the ranch. Dieter imagines a cyclone from his past and spins around in sweeping arcs, while Maouelue plays at sending ice crystals around his orbs and watches the angled refractions dance. He casually lobs one over at the spinning Dieter, who spots it mid turn and strikes it with the eagle end of his bladestaff. The orb soars out into the field amongst the animals. The two catch each other’s eyes and smile. They needed this moment after the haranguing pressures of the previous days. The stop their exercises and climb over the corral fencing to go and retrieve the ball, taking note of the animals along the way.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Vam and Heston have started a cookfire outside.  They've set out massive strips of white-grey meat, set to throw them on the fire as it builds.</p><p>"Mornin' friends!  How about some fresh snake meat to break your fast, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The meat is cooked to perfection, and stories are told around the breakfast camp fire.  (Anything you want to ask Vam or Heston?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Many thanks for the feast! The spoils of victory can be sweet indeed. I'm afraid I must now turn our concerns to the matters at hand. What do you know of Culver and Douglas? Is there anything that might link them to the Muhlen sisters? And what of Bazad?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston sits back in his seat, taking a chew off his plug of tobacco, offers it around.  Vam declines, the takes a deep breath and pushes his plate away.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, good sirs, I don't rightly know where to start.  Don't know if I'm going to enlighten you folks, either.  But I can tell you what happened after you slipped off to dreamland last night."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bunch of us, we stayed up taking care of this here snake.  Bellatrix came through and told us Douglas was ready for burial, so we took care of that in the patch the town's reserved for such things.  Bellatrix ended up taking off after that, but she mentioned that we might want someone to watch over the graveyard that night, just in case.  I put one of my hands on it, he didn't see anything amiss all night.  Not a hide nor hair from Bazad.  Rhahlad did come back, but only for a few seconds.  Heston here scared him right off, just showed him what you gents faced down in the streets last night."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So...  I guess the best way to begin about Douglas and Culver is to say, I really don't <i>know</i> all that much.  Culver was a staple of the town, Douglas just seemed to be a passer-by.  They got to drinking together, guess that was their bond.  There was a miner friend of theirs, too, used to keep the end three stools at the Pig warm, if you know what I'm gettin' at.  Didn't interact with Douglas, but Culver and I go way back.  Get most all of my supplies from him.  Shame to hear he's gone missing."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There was some scuttlebutt about Culver and Douglas dealing with the big man from the Pig, calls hisself Molur.  People say they were looking for something for him, maybe laundering it through Culver's store.  But that's all hearsay, I've never had a bad deal from Culver.  He's a good 'un."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"As far as them having a link to the Muhlen's, that's a no go.  S'far as I know," he sucks his teeth a bit, trying to wean out a bit of loose snake meat, "They don't have any connection at all.  There're all sorts and sizes of stories about the Muhlen's.  They're the royalty of Oakhurst.  Matter of fact, they used to have a mansion house not too far from here.  All decrepit now, not any place anyone could live in.  Their maw and paw used to live up there, along with gallons of children!  So many running all over the damned place!  The father, he had his life tied up into that mine, Krytos Hill.  When the belly went up on it, so did his fortune, and he moved right outta here, taking the whole family with him.  All except Veena and Hozieh.  They had already set up shop here and didn't want to head out."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Years passed, they became a staple of the town.  Some would even say the cornerstone.  We get so many just passing through, to have an established community started to make us think we could make something outta this place."  He takes a long, deep breath.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Shoulda figured it was too good to be true.  Those missing children.  Only happened for a short time, and stopped when Bellatrix went away.  They coulda been planning that for a while.  I bet Bellatrix might even have more to say on the subject, but she's scarred from the experience.  Surprised to even see her in town.  Horrible what we did to her, accused her of.  I'm rambling, but the bottom line is this - we had no idea they were witches or magicians or whatever they are.  We had no idea they were rotting this town from the inside out.  And wherever they are now, well they can just get going straight to hell, because if they ever come back to Oakhurst again...  We're going to have ourselves a mighty fine bonfire that night, I can tell you that."</p>

<p>Vam looks up and shakes his head.  "You gentlemen be careful if you go searchin' for trouble.  These women... they're insidious.  If they could be right next to us for so long and us not know anything?  They're capable of anything."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I am keen to discover more about these sisters as well. Perhaps Bellatrix's counsel will be most valuable. We should send word for her and take a closer look at this manse. We still have no clue of Culver's whereabouts."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Vam have you something else about them you would have us know?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam ponders for a moment, trying to think back to anything he can remember that can help you.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His eyes widen and he opens his mouth in astonishment.</p><p>"I can't believe I didn't see it before."  He looks at the both of you.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bazad.  Bazad was acting real strange, right?  Like he was hiding something.  He was on the Council too, and I just keep recalling that most of the votes, he went along with nearly everything Hozieh said.  Even if it didn't make sense, he was always...  I haven't thought about those kids in the yard for such a long time, but...  I think...  Guys, I think Bazad was their brother."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "If that right then...then...*would they drag their own brother off like that*? He was irreconcilably reticent...yes...this makes sense."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "The tunnels...we could follow the tunnels. Track them down to their lair!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouleue: "There is much to consider. Good Vam, good Heston, I fear we cannot dally to create our guild just now, but what say you stay behind and rally the townsfolk while we scout out the borders of these dark magics?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam shrugs, then nods.  Heston pipes up, gruff voice sounding like gravel being ground, "I can track just 'bout anythin'.  There's no trail on the one that got away.  The tunnels are being repaired by some folks from the town, but I'd say you could follow them, if you can find a way down into one.  Looks like they head south."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam adds, "That's the direction of the old Muhlen place.  You can catch the river south of here and follow it a few miles southeast.  Their place is about two hundred yards from the river, 'bout ten, fifteen miles down as the river flows."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Might be we should stay above ground for now and look for any signs of tunnel entrances on the way southward toward the Manor. I like my chances in an open field more than a labyrinth of tubes."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Some walls can be seen, others only felt, and yet there is a way to all things..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Riiiight...*he does this sometimes*. Grab those frosty balls and let's get out of here. My man Vam, could you spare us a couple of mounts for the road?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouleue looks up at Dieter slightly reproachfully, but obliges.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You bet!"  He whistles over to the farm hands, but Heston pats him on the shoulder.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Heston: "I'll get 'em set up."  And he ushers you both to the barn.  There are a few horses in here, a thick draft horse that looks similar to a Clydesdale.  There is a Criollo, grey/black with thick tufts of mane and tail.  There are two Mustangs, deep brown coats with tan manes.  They're all used for various work on the ranch, Heston explains.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Vam's good with you pickin' what you need.  Oh, and I wanted to ask you guys somethin'..."  He trails off, looking a little sheepish.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Shy not away from what you would ask Heston. We all need to support each other through this."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, it's just...  I could use that snake skin for so many different things.  I was hoping I could use some of it.  Not all, mind ye.  Just wanted to try my hand at a few things.  Some boots, a vest, maybe some leather armor or something padded-like?   I unnerstand if you guys wanted to sell it or something..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter smiles wrily.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking a fine snake jerkin would look might fair this time of year. Some bracers could help with some of this staff practice as well."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "And every wizard...needs a hat!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks at you expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Heston good man. Take the lot and practice your craft. I would love to see the fruits of your artistry. Should we encounter more of these serpents along the way, would you have us bring you more material?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...a *pointy* hat!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter sizes up the Clydesdale and Maouelue runs his fingers over the ashen beauty of the Criollo.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks giddy, which is an odd look for a cowboy.</p><p>"Ah, thanks so much!  I'll get going on that right away.  Pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers.  Got it!"  He tips his hat and run-shuffles away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The heroes smile after him fondly then lead their chosen steeds out of the paddock, heading back over to Vam to give their thanks.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Vam...how can we ever repay you?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam turns from cleaning the breakfast, putting out the cookfire.   He says, "...  When I was a kid, my pa used to tell me a scary tale of the Baba Yaga.  Ever hear of it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two mages shake their heads and listen intently.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  She's the witch of all witches.  Had scads of children, some famous wizards in their own right.  If you can bring back those two, alive, or something close to it, I want to ask them a question.  If you can't bring them back, ask them this question for me - Is it true that the Yaga still lives?  I'd be forever in your debt if you find the answer to that question, gentlemen."  He nods, solemnly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and be careful of that Criollo.  Her name's Ashpeak.  And she likes to bite."  He smiles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue repeats, "Ashpeak...steady girl..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She calmly looks back at the wizards.  And whinnies.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We will do this for you."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue secure their posessions and mount the two horses, heading South toward the manor.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The adventurous adventurers head south from the Stuniz ranch, steering their new mounts with great ease and ability.  (Animal handing, just for fun.  Advantage for both.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Then survival checks from both, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The horses listen to the two adventurers...  for the most part.  A few miles into the trip, you come to a river.  It's about 60 feet across, and the water level looks fairly deep.  It's a dark blue, moving well so the bottom is decently obscured.  That being said, you have already seem some fish darting about, occasionally one jumps out of the water.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Sitting on the bank of the river, about a couple hundred feet away, is a figure.  It looks like they might be fishing.  They're sitting on a small shoal where the edge of the bank meets the water smoothly.  For most of the trip, the river bank has been about two feet above the water level.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The riders being their horses to a gentle canter and approach the figure, waving casually in their direction.</i></p><p>“Ho there!”, shouts Dieter</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both see a halfling man, hairy feet dipped in the water, lying back on the shoal, eyes closed.  As you hail him, he opens his eyes, props himself up on an elbow, and says (in a <i>thick</i> cockney brogue), "Ahoy there lads, ahoy there and how're ye doing this fine day, eh?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "The waters flow kindly along the banks this morning. We are travelers seeking interesting wildlife in these lands. We mean not to disturb your rest kind halfling."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I take it you are familiar with the domain along the riverbank here, friend?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Those are kind words and kind faces, lads!  Well met, well met indeed.  I was just sunning meself by the bank here, taking a load off as they say.  Been traveling far and anon, singing my songs, telling my tales, of that you can be sure.  The domain...  Oh, aye, the old mansion atop the hill, aye, looks like there could be some good stories about that place, aye, indeed.  Sadly, Briffo Lightfoot has no such knowledge of that stormy looking place..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He gets up and moves to his pack. "I do have some items that are needing a good home, though?"  He looks at you two, expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Items, you say? Well I always have a good home for the like. What say you come with us and gather a few stories for your songs and we'll see what accommodations we can make for those."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"...  Uh..."  His almost juvenile smile falters massively.  His skin takes on a green pallor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Um...  Sh...  Sure, lads.  Let us away!  Did you want to see the wares first, or would you like to see a test of the stores, so to speak?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye that's the spirit. Let's take a look at what you have and then be on our way."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks more heartened at this prospect, and opens his bag.</p><p>"Briffo Lightfoot carries many a potion, these are but some of what I have to offer," and he pulls out five bottles.  One is red and swirling, a second is a larger bottle of the same variety liquid.  The next is cloudy green, and there looks to be a jellyfish-like creature swimming in it.  The penultimate is a dark purple brew with green bubbles drifting throughout.  Lastly, there is a strange, small vial.  This one is almost pearlescent, rainbow veins of light swirl through it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Also, I have these," he puts out a cloth with three rings on them.  One is golden, banded with flecks of emerald.  There is a platinum one with a crest of a shield as a figurehead.  There is another gold one, very scratched and pock-marked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They look over the potions and ask after their effects. Maouelue inspects the set of rings closely inquiring about...pricing.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and don't forget these here!"  He takes a roll off of his bag and unravels a few more items, giggling as he does so.  There are a couple small stones he's wrapped tightly together, both with a single matching rune on them.  A long stick of yew wood.  Lastly, there is an oddly glowing rod of a strange material.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Both men look at each other, then the runes on the stones, casting their mind to the rune coins and thinking whether these match any of them.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Oi mind, while we are showing wares here, have you ever seen the likes of these items here?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, pricing, of course!  I could see you are class fellows, I'll give you my friends discount on all of these items.  Now, the bottles are as follows - potions of healing, lesser and greater there.  A potion of waterbreating.  A potion of...  something with necrosis...  And that last... Well, that's a special one.  Not...  not quite sure what that one does.  Looks fancy, though, aye?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He begins digging out the unidentified elven boots and cloak as well as the shortswords of poisoning and the bandolier of poison vials, then lays them out for any potential identification.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, if you'd like to see the item and check it out.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>Selection timed out or was cancelled.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, bartering!  I would <i>love</i> to see...  And <i>what</i> do we have <i>here</i>?!?!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling sets to checking out the items you have.  Dieter and Maouelue pick up the stones, unwrap them from their binding and investigate their nature.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rune is not one from the set you've been looking for, but the wizard does recognize it.  These are sending stones.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few minutes in, Briffo gets uncomfortable.  "Say fellows, where...  um...  where did you get these items.  Now, mind you, I'm not opposed to some pilfered objects.  Been known to dabble in that trade myself.  Long time ago.  But these...  Lets just say, these are assassin's tools.  The shortswords are enchanted with poison.  This belt - full of poison vials!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The boots, enchanted with a stealth spell!  The cloak is elven for sure, I can only assume it has something similar on it.  Too powerful for my detection, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye...sadly we came by these tools by means of a...once and future assassin. The tale is woeful, but we would avenge the fallen. Were the tools of treachery to transmute into the teeth of retributions, oh that would a tasty sort of irony."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Do you recognize these poisons...for your part?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Where might someone concoct such filth? With what reagents?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Least ways we should take on what healing we can. I'm a bit keen on the special as well. What more can you say of these rings you are peddling?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue studies the rings with arcane intent.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"First ring there is poison resistance, second one, like the one I have on here, is a ring of protection.  Last one...  Again, I'm at a loss.  Looks pretty beat up.  Don't really remember where I came across it.  Haven't the heart to get rid of it, and no one seems to want to buy it."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "And lastly, what of this rod? It is...beautiful..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter picks up the scratched gold ring, looking at it more closely.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is, looks in very bad shape.  Maouelue points to the rod, and the halfling smiles widely.  "Let me show you!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He picks it up, says, "Stand back a bit."  Then he points the wand in the air and <i>whoosh</i> an string of fire darts straight up into the sky.  It climbs, climbs, climbs...  When it's almost out of sight, and looks like it might have fizzled out, the wizard and druid let out the breath they were holding.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then...  <i>BOOM</i> the sky is lit up by a dazzling fireworks display!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A myriad of colors pop and fizz and explode, to the delighted clapping of Briffo.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "My word! What a sight!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Impressive trinket indeed. What do you call it?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The rod of Sky Explosions!  Might need some work on the title.  But the results speak for themselves!  Played a show once where someone set these off while I was playing.  Very good time, I can tell you."  He smiles, reminiscing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I recall a festival or two with lights that would bewitch the eyes and mind. Have you a tune for us from that night? I would love to hear it. Dieter and I here each have a bit of performative flair with the odd bit of magic as well. Might be we could make a merry scene here."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I love a bit of a show, but perhaps we had better stay focused on our mission."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Heh, perhaps you're right. Perhaps this evening, should we be so lucky to find the time."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "How about it master halfling? Would you join our cause and we could share supplies? We have a surplus of weaponry and could always use the inspiration in battle."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling is a <i>whirl</i> of emotions.  He was very enthusiastic to play, starting to take out his shawm, but slowly puts it away, nodding that it might be better to conclude business.  His face is extremely malleable, and he wears his emotions right out front!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Positively, good men, I couldn't agree more.  What... ah... What exactly are we going to that house for?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I'm all of a dither at this excitement as well. Something in the air I guess. We go to seek truth long lost, long covered in shadow."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Do you have any experience in...the art of altercation Briffo?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Or do you write your songs from afar..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, I've been in a scrap once or thrice, but, if I'm hearing you correctly...  Nothing of that like, no..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Well I won't deny, there will be dangers ahead like as not, but if you are keen to test the limits of your inspirational powers, a tunesmith would be most welcome on our travels. We can provide an array of protections on the front end and could equip you in turn."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter gestures to the Light Crossbow slung across his Clydesdale and the shortswords laid out amongst the tradegoods.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling looks from you two to the weapons to the horses, then back to you.  He steels himself and says, "I've been on the sidelines for far too long.  Why not, eh?!  Time to <i>make</i> some stories, not just tell of them!  I'm with ye, lads!  Er...  whoever ye are!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Ah! Have we forgotten to introduce ourselves even in that manner! Oh my, we are impetuous. I go by Maouelue, elven wizard of the woodland realms, and my companion here, Druid of the Coast, Dieter...Dieter Deleter."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "There is something wholesome about this unexpected alliance that I sense will provide us with a wrinkle of advantage in the coming days. I remember listening to the rhythms of the crickets in the dunegrass as their pulsating chirps moved in and out of phase with eachother, echoed by the waves. There is music among my people as well, and I would hear it woven into the worldly ballads of our futures."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group spends some time divvying up equipment. Dieter hands over the crossbow and poison shortswords. He dons the elven boots and hands the robe over to Maouelue to do the same. He picks up the bandolier and considers it, then looks at Briffo.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Would you use these if it were to be in the service of stopping the one who would craft such ills?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>While Dieter asks this, Maouelue picks up the RoSE and turns the three rings over in his other hand.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I might be persuaded...  If the fiend was foul enough!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Add the boots of elven kind to your inventory, but you'll have to attune to them to get the boons.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check or short rest while studying them or meditating on them, something like that.  I'm going to be afk for a bit, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was actually just going to suggest a short rest for the very purpose. I can use the SR to identify other items as well, yes? I've got the cloak and a headscarf of stealth)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool, that works!  Cloak of protection and the headscarf is going to be a homebrew item.  I can get you stats in a bit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sweeeeet!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Before we get going with the house, I wanted to run something past you...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Run away!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(I have this: https://app.roll20.net/join/6068472/bY1K8A, if that works for you.  The options are these:  We could use the Discord for the fighting, but just use Roll20 for the map; would have to change much of anything with that route.  We could use the Roll20 solely and aside from the Discord; we would have to update our characters on there OR you can use the Beyond20 web extension to basically roll from DND Beyond, and it shows as your character on Roll20.)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That last option I would have to get us generic tokens, but that's pretty easy.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I like the idea of having maps up. Will r20 work with avrae? I could get down with the extension unless running or from r20 would get us access to more content/items/feats etc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think the best way, if you're cool with it, would be to get the Beyond20 extension and have it roll for us on Roll20.  Might be a bit of a learning curve, but you code, so...  prolly not!)</p>

<p>(How would you feel about keeping the text/rolls part of this campaign in discord? I like the maps in Roll20 and think we should keep using them, but having the coms here makes it easier for me to stay connected.)</p>

<p>(And that way we don’t have to write our own custom plugin 😆)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm totally down for that.  It's how the Ravenloft campaign goes, too.  There's really just the map and movement, just for spacing/blocking on Roll20.  We'll do that.  Want me to see if I can copy and paste the text here, or are we just starting from the jump spot?)</p>

Dieter: “That’s a fine ring you’ve got there master lightfoot. Might come in quite useful along the road. Let us get you now to healing rest. Please, back through the front with haste.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Crazy night, just getting back in from yard work, etc!)</p><p>As the group stares at the ring, flames dance along it's mirrored surface.  The flames change to ghastly faces, to glyphs, to writing, to faces again...  The three shake their heads, as if trying to rid themselves of the visions.  The wizard, for just a moment, seizes on something from the long distant past.  A tale of old forgotten lore regarding a lost ring of invisibility and...  was it fire?  Eons ago, there was a story about a lost ring...  But as soon as it comes, the memory goes.  </p><p></p><p>Briffo takes the ring back, almost conspiratorially.   He shakes off some of the dust, puts the ring back on, then leads the group northward through the NE door.</p>

<p>Towering bookcases line the walls and stretch across this room, but there are only a few books left on them.  A lounging area is furnished for comfort, though the leather looks aged.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are six main bookshelves, all marked with sigils.  Two couches and a few side tables are arranged for relaxed study.  There are several candelabra here, a couple still have hale candles in them.</p>

The majority of the books are tatters. barely kept together in their bindings.  There are five healthy books, though:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a contemporary interesting book entitled 'Physiologies of Magical Creatures' - Information on the biology of Beholders, Dragons, Unicorns, and more. Full of diagrams. This book is a little more eye-catching than most other mundane books.</p><p></p><p>This book is in mint condition. It is written in Common Speech. It has a lengthy foreword or dedication to someone.</p><p></p><p>This book is worth 50 gps and has 145 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
You find a contemporary guidebook entitled Remarkable Sunrises of the Great Desert: Crossroads of the Courier. This book is meant to give insight about the region of Anauroch, and the perils within.
This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Dwarvish (Dwarven Runes). It has a cover made of stone. Iron rings hold it together.
This book is worth 20 gps and has 754 pages.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a old skill book entitled Unearthed Theories on Knowledge. This book is meant to increase a wizards intelligence. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Common Speech. It is obviously not written in the author's mother tongue.</p><p>This book is worth 65 gps and has 214 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a recently written skill book entitled Unambiguous Conceptions on Intimidation. This book is meant to teach intimidation techniques. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Common Speech. It has a haughty and authoratative tone.</p><p>This book is worth 40 gps and has 505 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a contemporary biography entitled Exposed Triumphs of the Guild.</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Magical Writing (Requires Magical Deciphering). It looks to be a part of a series of volumes.</p><p>This book is worth 10 gps and has 543 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a bandolier hanging on the bookshelf by a door to the W.  There is a hallway on the E wall, on it's south end.  There is another door on it's north end.  This one looks stained with something...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter walks over to inspect the bandolier.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He compares it to the poison one he carries.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a very nicely made leather bandolier, this one carries parchment.  Scroll cases and buckles adorn the carrier.  Oddly, it looks almost new.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Hmm...don't mind if I do!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He pulls it down and puts it on.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a good fit!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They move east through the door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group goes through the hallway.  More wear and tear can be seen through here.  Tapestries are moth eaten or completely ripped down.  The hallway widens to a small entry room.  A door to the N and a door to the E.  The door to the N looks stained with something.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue nods to the group and they head over to the stained door to inspect.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's mildew.  It doesn't seem damp on this side of the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue pushes on the door and tries to open it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's hard to push initially.  All three of the group give it a go, and with a scraping, the door eases inward.  A short hallway opens into what looks like a green room.  Literally, the entire room is green with mildew and lichen, decay and rot and filth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a large bowl in the center of the room, also covered in green mold.  (This whole floor works as difficult terrain, which means your speed per round is halved.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you ease in further to the room you see six symmetrical doors.  One on the W and E walls, two on the N and S walls.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue extends a ghostly hand out into the middle of the room to try  and pick up the bowl to retrieve it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bowl is larger than the hand, and is covered in a slippery green slime...  (Strength check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage hand lifts the bowl and brings it to the wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The hand sets it down in the previous room just outside the door to the right. Maouelue directs the hand to wipe away the slime. Dieter tries to determine what the bowl is made of.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hand moves over the bowl, wiping slime and muck away.  It starts scooping out the inside as well, you see ashes coming out along with the slime.  The slime comes off, but there is still a greenish residue left after the muck is wiped completely off.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter guides his flame over gently singeing a small patch of the residue, trying to break through and see the material.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Small patches of bronze can be seen under patches of the green oxidization.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter continues to burn away what he can while the hand wipes away the char and polishes the bowl. Maouelue looks for any kind of marking.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No special markings adorn the bowl.  The polishing reveals a bronze brazier.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The party is going to the entry way room, correct?  The one S of the 'green' room?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue cannot sense the meaning of the message, but the druid hears it in the back of his mind, faintly.  </p><p>"Please.  Stay.  Help."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter considers the voice. From whom had it come? Was (s)he young? Were...they?...what was this aural apparition?</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Did you hear that?”, he asks of his companions.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue:
“Hear...what?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gives a look of grave concern to Dieter that is all the answer needed. Dieter begins to answer back...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The chill deepens, you feel like an answer comes, but you just can't be sure.  The cold seems to be coming from the vault doors.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter seems compelled. Without consulting with his group, he tractors toward the vault. The others follow in defense of their enthralled companion.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thin tendrils of blue vapor course around the door.  They wend and weave their way into and out of the scratches and markings on the doors, eventually bringing to bear twenty sigils arranged symmetrically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter begins tracing them in fire, Maouelue shrugs and does the same on the opposite side in ice, trying to match Dieter’s timing.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p><i>They spell weave top down, out to in along the sigil lines. The flame and ice auras casting a pale light flickering between violet and green where the overlap.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As your hand covers a rune, it glows a bright purple.  The fire and ice dont seem to affect it but your presence does, or at least your intent to 'activate' the runes.  When they are all lit, they give off a brilliant radiance, filling the foyer.  Then they slowly... fade to darkness.</p>

<p>This time, the wizard picks up the words... "Runes.  Four.  House.  Clues."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue translates for Dieter and Briffo...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “It says ‘Go fetch 3/4.’”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter turns to the entryway and up to the north room with the destroyed portrait ghost. He leads them to the West door and pushes on it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You enter the 'green' room.  (Perception check for what you think this room is.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(AFK dinner)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks from the mage hand holding the bronze brazier to the green slime on the walls and floor.  He bends down to scrape some of the muck away and sees cedar wood flooring.  He does the same for the walls, and finds the same.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees this and he instructs the hand to continue wiping away areas of slime to reveal anything hiding underneath.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hand scours the room, unveiling a couple more bronze ewers.  But no sigils are here.  There are four doors, two on the N and two on the S.  The door to the W opens into the library. (They put a fucking sauna between an art gallery and a library?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They proceed to the north  doors and peek through both.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The one on the NW opens into damp, disgusting scraps of what used to be towels and linens.  The NE door opens onto various bottles and vials on shelves.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter never says “no” to a vial. He starts hovering them into his bag as he looks at the labels.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Mostly perfumes and soaps.  Some look a little volatile, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They leave it alone for the time being, head backward and to the west.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back to the library?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think so. I’m a little turned around, but I’m going to go through the northwest hallway making our way to the top left corner of the map.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're good!  The W door leads to the library.   This is where you picked up the scroll bandolier.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They move back through the house, through the prep kitchen and out through the east door then up to the north end of the hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall ends in a right turn, a door stands in front of the party.  It leads back to the main foyer.  Briffo scratches his head.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Kid bedtime)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I updated the map on Roll 20.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue has an idea. He runs through the house and distributes ghost crystals into the three sigil containers in numeral order.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>While his companion runs around like a mad wizard, Dieter inspects the scrolls in his bandolier.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The cold seems to linger in front of the vault doors while the party splits up to hunt for clues.  The crystals are deposited by the already found sigils.  No reaction is noticed.  Dieter's bandolier is empty... save for one carrier.  There is a bit of parchment in one.  When unfurled, it reads:
*I'm the one that cleans off the dirt
I can fall and not get hurt
Look for me to beat the heat
While I run without any feet.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls out his water skin and dribbles a few drops ok the parchment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The few drops soak into the parchment, partially showing a sigil under the writing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter full saturates the paper, inspecting the sigil.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The full sigil appears, it is one of the runes you've been looking for.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He catches Maouelue’s attention as he passes by and shows it to him.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What do you make of this?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both consider the circle of runes they had seen, trying to recall the message. Maouelue thinks through what he has put together so far.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“R<i>NEM</i>R</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Markdown is messing with my underscores)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Runemark? Runemare? Runemort? Rinemire? I...this is....what is this new rune?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he mutters, the group heads back into the prep kitchen and looks around some more.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you say the guesses, a rumble takes the whole castle over, threatening to dump the entire second floor into the first.  After almost a minute of shaking, the house settles.  The area the party is in wasn't damaged further, but from the crashing heard after the earthquake stopped, you figure some of the house took damage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the party walks into the kitchen, a strange sight greets them.  Two of the larger knives are hovering in mid air.  They fly at the group!!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll start initiative tomorrow!  I'm beat!  Great game today.. <i>You're almost there!</i> All the clues are out, just gotta get into the final room... 😃)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p><i>The group takes a brief rest, then forges onward back to the vault door. They take a longer look at the sigils, seeing if any of them match what is labeled by the ones they have found, or if any match the mysterious circle they keep finding. Could there perhaps be a "bust rune?", perhaps a "Roulette wheel?"...could it be so simple as that?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All of the runes from the coins in your posession are on the vault door, along with several others.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group's steaming breath can be seen billowing from your mouths now, its pretty close to freezing in the front entry way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue steels himself, then traces the runes in the same order as the circle they have been seeing.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The runes glow blue, then purple, then crimson, back to blue, cycling through the rainbow of colors until with a blinding flash, they light up brilliant white.</p>

<p>A low rumble starts, intensifies and sharpens to what sounds like laughing.  Familiar laughing.  The laugh rises in pitch, becomes a searing scream in your ears.  The runes go out.  Darkness invades all of your senses.  Even Maouelue's dark vision is affected.  Suddenly, a dark shadow comes <i>through</i> the closed vault doors.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a lightening in the foyer, a softness comes into the room.  The cold abates significantly.  A sad sort of peace comes to the two adventurers.  There is a certainty of finality here.  Not for the mission or the mysteries of the house, but for their friend.  Although they both want things to be different, the vacant stare of their newly found and newly gone friend is both heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.  The halfling wears a beatific smile, hand still clutching the totem around his necklace.  Soft sounds of rain can be heard now, pattering on the escarpments and damaged grounds of the old Muhlen Manor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “He...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “...was too young to die. He did not deserve this fate. Our cruel mission and heedless frivolity have led this poor halfling to his death...at our behest. I shall not forget this.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What is it he clutches at?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter let’s Maouelue’s words wash over him and a steely determination sets about him. He begins to stare at Briffo with a fury, as if forcing this image into his being so that he may remember this solemn hubris. After a few moments, he closes Briffo’s eyes, then moves his hand from the locket. Dieter looks down and attempts to open it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue now comes over too and makes a ritual gesture of peace. He then bends down and begins to remove Briffo’s worldly burdens. As he does this, he pulls out the rings and the Rod of Sky Explosions. He offers the Ring of Invisibility over to Dieter and puts the Ring of Poison Resistance and the Ring of Protection on.</i></p>

<p>The hands come away easily.  It is a simple locket, one with pictures inside.  A younger, smiling Briffo stands opposite a beautifully plain halfling girl.  Both are immeasurably happy.

<p>The cold comes back with a vengeance.  Immediately, the frost is back, you can see your breath again.  Dieter's head snaps back, his eyes roll back in his head.  He stands...</p>

Dieter: “It’s time for a *wildfire*...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter hoists Briffo’s body up onto his shoulder and picks up his boomerang. He fits the Ring of Invisibility into his jacket pocket and heads out to the front door in large sweeping strides. Maouelue follows, sorting out a few of Briffo’s knickknacks as he tries to keep pace. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is now producing small flames here and there setting a char on fire now a curtain now a rotting canvas. He has a carnal fury about him and his inner rage roils to an inferno. He unleashes every ounce of agony blistering every artifice he can find as he strides the group out to the entryway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thunder rolls as the group leaves the house.  Small fires turn to big fires.  The group are about a hundred feet away when a crack of lightening hits the house full bore.  The rest of the second floor collapses.  The fires expand and the former beautiful mansion burns unabated.  Suspiciously, the rain has stopped.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue hands Dieter the Rod of Sky Fire. Dieter obliges and points it straight at the conflagration. He waits for a moment, watching the flames rise, then fires off one blast directly at what used to be the front door.</i></p>

<p><i>The group heads back toward the resting spot at the edge of the river where they met Briffo. They lay down their things and make a small camp, then Dieter begins digging at the ground with his staff, outlining a grave site. Maouelue collects stones and Dieter imbues each of them with magic as they make a small mausoleum for their friend.

He lays eyes on his companion’s slumber. “Let him sleep,” he thinks to himself, then proceeds to inspect their new equipment and keep watch on the camp while awaiting the dawn. The sky is now a dark purple, the moon ringed by seven bright stars shines down on the Wizard. “Selene, watch over us.”Be our light in the darkness, be our shield from death. Be the one who stays our dying breath...”</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair's slumber is calm, restorative.  There are strange visions occasionally flitting past, however.  Quick visions of a man with a moustache, of two serpentine sisters, of dark tunnels leading into the world; occasional frights to bitter the sweet memories of their friend's send off.  </p><p></p><p>The stars wink at Dieter.  Telling of arcane, unknowable secrets.  One of the stars goes out.  Comes back again.  The world then gets covered in darkness, but for only a second.  Whatever just passed over the moon must have been huge.  And either far away or silent.  Dieter keeps his vigil.  (Survival check from Dieter, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't make out what flew overhead.  Whatever it was, it sent a shiver down his spine.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Eventually the two come out of their slumber and reverie, refreshed and ready for the next leg of their journey.  (Where to?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We need to get a lay of the land. Do we still have that old map the Miner gave us? I saw some dark beast flying this way..." 
*He points in the direction he saw the shadow traveling. Dieter then looks around to gauge their current surroundings, taking note of the direction of the river flow and looking out to the horizon to get a sense of their extended environment. He is feeling strongly pulled by the course of the water, as his time away from the coast is taking a toll on his psyche.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye, it would be good to gain a vantage and consider our next move carefully. Perhaps we should ride back and report to Vam and Heston with our tidings and seek a map of the greater area. I'm also keen to deliver this snakeskin and see how our budding tanner-tinker has progressed!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye...but first, I have one bit of unfinished business..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter packs up his things and mounts his Clydesdale with one backward glance at the mausoleum. Maoulue follows suit, and in the morning light, the two trot back over to the smouldering remnants of Muhlen Manor. Their pace slows as they approach and inspect the grounds for safe passage back to the center of the ruin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Tendrils of smoke rise from the smoldering remains of what once was Muhlen Manor.  Between the lightning and the internal fires, nothing remains but small bits of metal, a few crude blocks of stone, and ashes...  and a marble staircase leading to a box of stone, the runed vault doors barring entrance still.  There are many places where the fire even swept into the basement level, clearing out whatever was down there.  Earthen tunnels can be seen routing the earth below the main level, with entrance holes scattered hither and yon. </p><p></p><p>As the party approaches the scene, you both notice that getting across will be dangerous at best as there is no bridge or way to access the staircase directly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers the distance to the staircase and looks for nearby sources of water.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are several puddles from the night prior.  Additionally, just over the next hill is a wonderful pond, just a bit algae-covered.  It's about 250 feet from the marble box.  (By the way, I say it's a box - it's actually a 40ft x 50ft by 20ft tall room.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gestures for the group to follow him. He leads them around to the pond and alternately uses magic to move water over to the smoldering wreckage then freeze it, crediting an icy bridge over to the staircase.</i></p><p><i>Dieter, catching on, begins to bring hands full of gravel and dirt over to ease the passage on the icy surface.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How did you want to do this?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(How do I want to make the ice bridge or proceed?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If we want to roll that back and add some chance to it I’m coo with that. Lmk.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, my fault.  So the spell takes water within a five foot cube and manipulates it, but you only have the 5ft amount of water to work with.  The stairway is about, let's say, 20 feet away...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(5ft cube = 125ft^3. I’ll make a bridge that is (25ft long <i> 1ft tall </i> 5ft wide)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You got it, just wanted to make sure!  Hitting me with algebra!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I can cast multiple times too right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group smirks at their cheeky method of navigating the embers. It's almost</i> <b><i>too easy...</i></b></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They make their way towards the staircase, Maouelue lightly chuckling, but Dieter reeling himself in as he sees the dread doors again.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You approach the doors, everything seems solid, if a bit sooty.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They approach the vault door and once again take a look at it to see how it fared during the blaze storm.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It looks exactly like it did before, no marring, no soot.  You can see the sigils better now, in the light of day.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter does not hesitate. He traces the sigils in the order they have seen in their visions...the circle of runes.</i></p>

<p>The runes on the coins read 'Runemark'.  The runes on the door are a hodge-podge, it was designed to be that way.  The specific runes in the rooms and on the parchment don't really have a correlation to anything.  You're getting the feeling that the 'runemark' password was a trap.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As it pushes inward, you see a cozily lit study, of sorts.  Bookshelves line the walls, the books covered in heavy leather and looking very old.  There is a massive bear-skin rug on the floor, a considerable trophy of skill and strength.  There are numerous chests in this room as well.  The entire room is lit by what looks to be ever-lasting candles.</p>

<p>The wand of secrets pings, points to a corner where a beautiful set of plate armor stands upright.  There is a base where the armor stand could be moved toward the door of the room.  The plate is a burnished steel, but it looks to have oxidized a bit, giving it an interesting black-green sheen to it.  The metal is dull and does not reflect any of the light shining on it. </p><p></p><p>The books smell musty but not in a damp sort of way.  They must have been here for centuries, you figure.  (History check for more!)  Maouelue takes down a book or two, inspects them.  They are in a language that is almost impossible to read... as the word never stop moving on the page.  Line after line, picture after picture, the books are a maze of movement.  Diagrams drip between pages, margins are attacked and seized.  There are many books like this.  Although, as Maouelue searches, he does find a few that are able to be read... by a wizard.  (d6 roll, please!)</p>

<p>There is one chest that sits off to a side, looking more ornate than the others.  This one <i>looks</i> locked and trapped... (Sleight of hand check to disable& unlock chest, with advantage if you have thieves' tools.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue tries looking through the bins, sifting through the coins.  The connection to what's off isn't hitting the wizard, but he knows something is off.  Something strange about the feel of the coins.  The weight...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two adventurers try their hands at the ornate chest.  There are no thieves' tools, however the men find a few bits and bobs that could work.  Alas, they do not.  The lock is still in place, but there are no traps.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Y'all start spilling <i>left and right</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue is curious about the bottoms of the chests. Whether they seem...solid, and whether the coins ring as expected when hitting the floor. Dieter takes a closer look at the staff on Maouelue’s back in the meantime. He sometimes likes to disengage like this when Maouelue is on one of his arcane inquiries.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bottoms of the trunks are normal, typical wear and tear.  They seem like they've had water damage at some time or other, but nothing to hurt the solidity of them.  The coins do make a leaden thump instead of a ring, which is strange for gold.  You might expect that with silver, or even copper.   Gold pieces, though, usually have a bit more metallic clang to them.  These do not.  As for the staff...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm headed out tonight, but hit a perception check with advantage first thing tomorrow and I'll let Dieter know what he's looking at!)</p>

<p>(I hear you!  So much craziness...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A bevy of weapons and items greet your gaze.  A longsword sheathed in a gorgeously made scabbard.  A set of bracers with Giant runes emblazoned all over them.  A plate helm with a rime of frost on it.   A mace that glints mischievously.  A silver ring with rubies inset in a cross lies on the floor of the chest, as does a beat up looking piece of lead... with 'Runemark' inscribed on it in a circle.  Lastly, a shield with the visage of a dragon being ridden by a wizard is attached to the underside of the chest's top.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
There is a piece of parchment that catches Maouelue's eye.  It reads:
*Dearest daughter, 
  Remember that the Barbarian's Wind is* magical *!
  Only speak the word to unlock it's secrets.
                          Love, Father*
There is a Giant rune underneath the word Father, in a different script.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries at all, playing goalie over here, too!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter picks up the shield and tests its balance.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "There's a lot of gear here, we may need to sit and consider it a bit."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group takes a short while to sit and consider the items they have found here. The henchmen take a look at the helm and mace, Dieter looks at the bracers and shield, and Maouelue looks at the ring and staff.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue passes the sheet of parchment around as they do this.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As they go about the equipment, they lay it all out on the ground so as to make an outline of the wearer, shield on the right, sword on the left with a bracered arm and scabbard hung low, the helm facing upward, the mace hung opposite the scabbard, and the ring, just where the hand might poke out from behind the shield in combat.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(For the fun of it, group Arcana check!  Even the henchmen - just roll at advantage for them.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can get the deets for three items, by the way.)</p><p>(Cool, I'll start making the characters.  They'll be shared in the 'Campaigns' section of Beyond.  Don't know if you can edit the non-assigned characters, but feel free to try.  Let me know if you can.)</p>

(Ok cool. I think that works well, since the item is OP already :). )

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I would like to be able to equip them with shit I have in my bags though if that's cool.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(But I assume it would all fall to the ground when the spell is up etc, so they would need to take the time to equip it next time they are summoned.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Staff of Baobab is special.  It can only be used by a druid.  When inserted into soil, a great baobab tree grows (you can decide the height & look).  The tree bears only two pieces of fruit per growth.  This fruit, when consumed, heals 1 disease and does 8d4+8 healing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A pure feeling of life seems to seep into Dieter's being as he takes the staff from Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It is OP, isn't it?!  Maybe you're just using it well!!  I was thinking it would work where they're fresh each time out, but I think we can make some concessions here.  Since they have personalities, there's an argument that they should keep their equipment, etc.  You can almost use them like a follower in Skyrim, pack them full of stuff.  These guys, though, go to an extra-planar dimension when their time is up.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That works! I love it!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Reset/charges on the staff?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The shield is called the Shield of Disruption.  Adds +1 to your AC and it has 4 charges to impose a CON save (DC10+Intelligence modifier) on a creature using any spell.  You can spend 1 charge against the spell, or spend more for higher level spells.  (If you wanted to counter a spell at 5th level or above, the DC would go down by 3 for every level higher.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The staff can only be used once every seven days.  Only once charge in that timeframe.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mace twinkles in the candlelight.  This is the Mace of Reduction.  The attack and damage rolls have +1, crits on 19 and 20, and on a natural 20 the target is under the effect of the <i>Reduce</i> spell.</p>

<p><i>The group ruffles through the burgeoning bags of holding to produce the Barbarian’s Wind tome. Dieter holds it in his hand and speaks the rune using his most ostentatious form of Giant.  (He loves to be very presentational in front of the henchmen...)</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry bud, you wanted to do the short rest and attune to everything, correct?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the druid holds the book aloft and speaks the Giant rune, the book glows a glittery blue hue.  The words on the page magically rearrange themselves into different words, pictures, diagrams.  As they come together and form a completely new tome, a sharp pain courses through Dieter's head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I didn't try the Beyond route.  I have a pretty cool way to add the attack for anyone here, though, without keying it up in Beyond.  You probably saw some of my monkeying around in the bot testing area.  I can !attack create whatever special weapon and that should be good.  The armor and shields are another story...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the words coalesce, Dieter has a harder and harder time concentrating on the book.  At the height of his ability, he's still not able to comprehend the language or read the book at all.  His headache starts to get worse...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The shield resets at short or long rest.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Hand me....ugh....hand...GIVE ME THAT HELM!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Stenchy picks it up and hands it over to Dieter, who hastily puts it on, not fully knowing what it will do.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Is he still holding the book?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>It's a bit awkward to hold the book while putting the helm on, but Stenchy lends a hand to help him sort it out.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the helm goes on, a feeling of sharp cold comes over Dieter.  It helps quell the pain of his head, but only momentarily.  (Is he still trying to read it?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cold abates and Dieter starts feeling comfortably warm, noticing for perhaps the first time how cold his surroundings really were before.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter sets the book down momentarily and produces a flame, he sends a bit of it into each of the emptied rune chests to provide some additional light and heat in the room. He gestures to Maouelue to take a look at the book.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouleue picks up the tome and tries to read some of it as well. He wonders whether he'll have the same searing experience.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is able to read it perfectly.  It is the musings of an arcanist who was obsessed an ancient race of people called the Netherese.  The land of Netheril was located where the Anauroch desert is today, and a mageocracy of peoples inhabited the land.  Thousands of years ago, the archmages of Netheril controlled magics unheard of, and with their prideful demise, most of the artifacts and knowledge died with them.  That did not stop this particular arcanist from searching, and clearly finding, books and items from the bygone era.  This spellbook is both an account of what the arcanist was able to glean from the books in this library, as well as his dabbling into some of the forgotten magics therein.  The books and items in this room are priceless, worth more than a mansion in Waterdeep for some buyers.  Collectively, you could be looking at millions of platinum to the right person.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "An interesting tale to be certain...Now which of the Lord's daughters do you think was...*dearest*?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I know not, but this mystery seems to know no bounds. We should take what we can and move on."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group packs up their things and Dieter coalesces the fire and moves it over toward the plate armor.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Stenchy looks admiringly at the armor and sizes himself up against it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Stenchy: "Egh bosse....I can try eet on?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Let's shove it aside first and see what happens..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Who is touching the armor first?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter is responding, Stenchy is already coveting the armor and running his sweaty hands over the epaulets.</i></p>

<p>The hole is four by four, so it's about as big as a person.  Not too too much room to move around, but Dieter can light up the hole.  The ladder descends <i>far</i> into the earth.  The light shines about twenty feet down, just shows darkness beneath.  The druid throws the flame down.  It travels down, down, down...

<p>The spider moves 20 feet per 6 seconds.  SpiDieter crawls vertically down the shaft, moving swiftly.  Three hundred feet down, a full minute and a half later, the spider feels the wall turn away ninety degrees to create the ceiling of a massive cavern.

<p>The group makes their way down the ladder.  It's not as rickety as you would think, the handholds are secure.  There is a bit of a scare when Frenchy slips on a rung.  Other than that, everyone gets down.  The water at the edge of the cavern, at the bottom of the ladder, is only a foot deep.  The henchmen are wading, waiting for the wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He beckons to the Henchys to follow him and walks around the perimeter counter clockwise to a small just he sees on the East wall. He once again tests the waters as he steps out and gauges the distance to the center. It looks to him like about 20ft at that point. He begins to pull up a large cube of water from the area, hovering it in the air and spinning the 125 cubic feet of water in a mesmerizing ball that flickers reflections of the flames all over the cavern. He slowly begins to extend the water into a long bridge, similar to the one used above ground, this time considering the terrain, he makes it slightly narrower with higher sides to act as railings. He then leads the group across, giving Dieter time to do...whatever it is he needed to do so badly...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Let me know your take on that. I've got one read on it that since the fog isn't dense it means that the overall amount of water should fit into the 5x5x5 cube when condensed and so it should clear the whole range. LMK your take)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What overall range are you going for?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If I can do 60ft in all directions in front or around Maouelue that would be ideal.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Since that is the range of the spell. Do you think the spell reads like I’m thinking?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think maybe this spell doesn’t care about density on second read, but would be dope if it worked that way. If no go on that, he does the same thing in a line toward the snake.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok I did some more reading and the 5’ cube is the bounding box of the spell. So no go on pulling it from everywhere. There are a few takes on whether or not I’m allowed to manipulate fog with this at all since it is not in liquid form.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry for the delay, just doing some reading on this.  Seems to be a bit of contention in the D&D community, actually!  Give me one more sec...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No prob! I like this kind of investigation actually.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I can't do this now that I'm reading more.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The wording seems to be 'an area of water that you can see within range - 30ft - and that fits in a 5ft cube.  I think there's an argument to be made that. since you can freeze the amount of water you need to make a bridge, you take 5ft cube and it makes as much ice.  The density doesn't matter there because, I'm using the ice-cube theory, the water you put in is the water you get out.  Steam is different, and I think should be treated as such.  The question is how much steam or fog would a 5ft cube make?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think you have to take liquid water then change its form and not the other way around. There are other spells that manipulate fog, so i get it. )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He casts that in the last place he saw the snake)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I would say Maouelue could target the Shape Water spell on a certain pinpoint.  If he's creating ice or moving water, it can go for the 5ft cube.  If he's manipulating liquid as a gas, I would say the range of the spell is targeted, so that's a 30ft cube.  There are spells that deal with fog specifically, but I think there's a point to be made with Shape Water.)</p>

<p><i>The adventurers feel the tension strangely slipping away as they break bread and regale each other with their feelings about the last battle. It's quite a merry band by the end of the rest. Their spirits are in much higher order now that they've been replenished. And now, they begin to think about a way out...and loot. They love loot.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Second wind resets on short or long rest.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Frenchy: "Iz eet me, or deed we neglecte to searche ze roome properly?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(We did a SR for attunement and such up in the bear rug chamber, yeah? I know I used it and expected it to be gone, but both my sheets had it available. I'm thinking it reset back then. Your call.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(My understanding is you can short rest at any time, you just won't have all of your hit die every time.  If you use hit die on a short rest, they don't come back until after a long rest, and then you only get half of your available hit die at that time.  So, if you use four hit die now, after you take your next long rest, you'll have 2 hit die to use for a next short rest.  You don't have to use hit die at a short rest, you can just SR to attune if you need to.  I think that's what you did up in the vault room.  You took all of the major items, did you want to go check for more?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Or did you want me to go over the new items, because I prolly forgot to do that!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The longsword is called 'The Blade of the Mists', +1 longsword.  Contains 2 charges, Misty Step.  After you make a successful hit, you can cast as a bonus action.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'm cool with the hit die. I didn't use any upstairs. Come to think of it, I don't know why I would have had any reason to use Second Wind all day since I don't think the suit of armor PWND stenchy that bad. I'll double check)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bracers are 'Bracers of the Giantess'; Once per day you can slam the bracers together and cast <i>Enlarge</i> on yourself.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The plate helm is the 'Frostbitten Helm'; grants wearer resistance to cold damage.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(found it, i did take an sr upstairs, but it was before the armor fight where he used SW, so I'll remove the HP)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silver ring inset with rubies in the form of an x or + is the 'Ring of Aid'; Once per day you can activate it to give the wearer 1d6 healing at the beginning of their turn.  Or, out of combat, can heal from 1d6 to 1d36 points of healing - basically 6 charges of 1d6 healing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, getting slammed at work at the moment...)</p>

<p>(No prob. I'm doing a bunch of stuff too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Would you be down to add another friend into this adventure sometime in the next week or so? You might remember my old friend Dan Kohl from back in the day. He and I got to talking and I thought it might be cool to hook him in at some point where it makes sense. He’s got a meet up campaign going but it’s really slow because it’s only every 1-2 weeks. I think he wants to play a bear totem barb or something.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I would totally be down for that!  Would you want a restart, or add him to the current?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Add to current I think. I gave him a synopsis of the action so far. I was thinking maybe we meet him for some reason after this current dungeon/thrust. Sounds like he’s a bit busy this week, so we’d have a little time to work it in.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Any time he wants to join, I'm more than happy to add him in.  If he wants to add me in Discord or email me to get me background info or whatever, feel free to throw him my contact info.)</p>

<p>(BTW, I like your rp of Amber, you're nailing it!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group moves together along the NE tunnel.  Frenchy sees much better now, noticing that after forty or so feet, the tunnel takes a turn due E.  The light shines forty feet in advance of the party, dimming at the edge of that distance.  The tunnel continues straight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party starts noticing that the tunnel looks carved out of the clay heavy soil.  It is ten feet high, a little less than ten feet wide.  The walls look damp but not wet.  A heavy smell of earth hangs everywhere.  Along with the tang of iron, but that could be from your bloodstained clothes...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silence is the worst part.  Sounds echo, every footfall, even though they're quiet, sound like a heavily laden <i>thump</i> as you all walk.  Stenchy sounds like a bucket of silverware jouncing around.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'm an anime girl at heart)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'll send your DC info along to him. Looking forward to that!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue winces at each echoing step, but there's not much for it at this point. He makes a palms down gesture to Stenchy trying to get him to lighten his footsteps. Stenchy makes a show of understanding and doing so, but it does almost nothing to change the clatter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!  In all honesty, Barbarians are my favorite class!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter tells Maouelue and Stenchy to hold for a moment and takes the torch from Stenchy, moving forward along the passage with Frenchy to scout a bit more stealthily.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the two proceed stealthily up the tunnel, they come to a bisection in the path.  One tunnel goes NE, the other SE.</p>

<p><i>On second thought, there's no time for that nonsense. Maouelue slowly leads the fighter forward with his elf vision making sure to stay well behind any sign of the light from their companions.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter makes a mark in the ground with his staff pointing down the SE corridor and moves forward with Frenchy. They hear some plated footfalls distantly behind them and get a sense of what's going on.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Going NE, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(SE)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(BTW, this would be the only thing that would hold the game up, with adding another person.  I have no problem with it and can even eliminate some of the rolls, but that would be up to you guys.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Frenchy moves his foot slowly down the path, he feels the floor... change.  It is raised in this part.  Not significantly, but enough for him to feel it under his boot.  He puts a hand out to stop Dieter from passing him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Frenchy stoops down to inspect the change in the floor and beckons Dieter to do the same.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a distinct line of something on the floor.  (Frenchy or Dieter can get his fingers underneath it, if they want.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter digs underneath the object carefully, brushing away the debris.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a padded piece of wood, the covering made to look and feel like the surrounding floor.  It lifts easily... and the stench of rotting, decaying meat hit you both full and hard. (CON save.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both feel an urge to vomit as the wood plank is moved away.  It stretches the width of the floor and extends to fifteen feet forward down the tunnel.  The wood feels flimsy under your fingers.  You both can also see that the tunnel tapers at the edge of the torch light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Steadying themselves and holding their breath, they look for what might be the source of the stench under the board.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The board is moved back, slowly, carefully.  A trench full of body parts, in various states of decay, lie ten feet deep.  Sharp points of some sort stick up here and there within the pit.  As you peer further into the miasma or filth...  something moves.</p>

<p>The two watch as whatever is in the grossness moves from their left to right, getting slightly farther away from them in the process.  Sick gurgling sounds, squelching and liquid <i>flops</i> can be heard as the thing moves around.  It doesn't seem to sense your presence, for the moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>What used to be limbs get sucked below the mire as you both watch on.</p>

<p>Frenchy spots something slinking towards the pair...  Then loses it.  He thought it looked like a slug of some sort, but didn't get a great look at it when it surfaced?  Did it surface?  The smell is somehow getting stronger.  (CON save, please, for both!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Although it <i>seems</i> stronger, it's not affecting either of you at all.  The nausea is abated, at least for the moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, an arm still grasping a dagger gets <i>sucked</i> with great force under the flotsam.  You both peer into a multi-chambered eye for a moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It blinks.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then dives away, further down in the pit.</p>

Dieter: "I'm not sure what in the seven hells that thing is, but we had better backtrack and meet up with the others."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Nope!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group takes the NE path, moving quietly...  except for Stenchy.  The wizard, who is constantly checking behind himself for fear of being snuck up on, spies something <i>slithering</i> and skittering down the path behind them.   (Survival check from whomever is leading the group - Frenchy, right?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The path continues on.  As the group continues on,  they see a three-foot diameter hole in the ceiling of the tunnel, directly above them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter raises his flame to the hole to try and light it up a bit.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party moves onward.  (Good movie by the way, if you haven't checked it out!)  </p><p>The path continues on...  ten feet, twenty more...  Fifty more...  The skittering keeps pace with Maouelue, staying just at the edge of his vision.  He sees it crawling on the ground.  Then loses it for a time.  The party can hear the sounds of little claws hitting the stones in the floor, clicking together... unnerving them.  Until, suddenly...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Onward is SO GOOD!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tunnel opens into a strange cavern.  The walls arch overhead quickly, almost at a 90 degree angle.  Sounds echo frightfully here.  There are noises of dripping and the slight splashing of water.  The torch illuminates the area, but only just.  The room seems to be getting bigger and bigger the farther they go.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check from Mao again, please!)</p>

<p><i>Maouelue beckons the group to put out their lights and to stay by the door while he scouts out the room with his darkvision. He proceeds along the left wall.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!  Is everyone staying together, in a group; single file?; circled up?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard looks around as the other three huddle and shine lights around the area.  They are in a large open space.  The three without darkvision are not able to see the walls, but they can hear noises bouncing all around the cavern.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue searches the area, looks up the wall and sees...  a grub-like creature clinging to the wall about twenty feet up.  It's about the length of a grown human's leg, and about a foot in diameter.  It is looking at Maouelue.  Strands of spittle hang from its maw.  As the liquid hits the floor of the cave, it hisses.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He strides over, eyes locked on the crawler, furiously intent on laying it low. He thrusts with two hands!</i></p>

<p><i>He misses! Bahamut has forsaken him! Perhaps because he has not been particularly devout of late....or ever. Why the wizard chose this moment is anyone's guess.</i></p>

<p>The laughter bounds around the cavern and bounces off the stalactites and stalagmites surrounding the party.  Their merriment is met with peace, calm, tranquility.  The sound of water can be heard, somewhere farther on the other side of the cavern.  Dripping brings them home to where they are, and how far under the surface they've gone...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue is the first to recover his wits and gestures for calm. The party, slightly crestfallen, obliges. They take stock of the scene and a mild guilt forms in their diaphragms. It's all of a mess. What could the Muhlens possibly be doing down here? The group moves to a small outcropping they saw near the entrance and sits down to make camp and recover their strength.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They have no idea what time of day or night it might be, but it must be getting on. Stenchy takes the first watch as the group sits down to their rations and dwindling water supplies.</i></p>

<p>(Where's an infinitely respawning camp of kobolds when you need it?!?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(The mechanics for the watch: Since Maouelue is a full elf, he would only need to get 4 hours of reverie to be 100%.  You can set up camp where everyone sleeps, survival checks would be needed, and you could get snuck up on.  For those on watch, as long as they get 8 hours,  they can benefit from the long rest.  Perception checks would be needed for those on watch during those hours.  How did you want to stagger the sleep/reverie?)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’m planning on having the henchmen take the first and second watch to give mao his 4 hours, then he can take over. Presumably they will disappear when the 24 hours is up, so I’m always baiting them a bit in that way.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Good idea.  Their 24 hours is pretty close, too. Probably another 9 hours - from the start of the long rest?)</p>

<p>(So, Maouelue and Dieter and sleeping through, correct?  Stenchy is taking the first two hours, then Frenchy is taking another two.  After that, Maouelue wakes up and relieves them for the last four hours of Dieter's sleep?)</p>

<p>Stenchy's had a tough day.  Although he found some good gear, fighting in it, wearing it, using the new magical items...  it has taken a toll on the big man.  He's tired.  And as his head nods down... down... down... As his friends sleep blissfully innocent dreams of treasures to come and mysteries to solve...  There is a hiss of something thrown in the air at the group.  (Give me a d4 roll.  Dieter 1, Frenchy 2, Maouelue 3, Stenchy 4)</p>

<p><i>As Maouelue rises, he feels a new kind of light in his heart. These brushes with death, these revivals, these dark forces gathering, his will...no, his duty to quell them with the divine light...Maouelue begins to feel his devotion coalesce. He must meditate on this soon.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We cannot thank you enough, may I call you, friend? Your aid is most welcome. Would you come rest with us and hear of our tale? Perhaps you could tell us a bit about what brings you to these foul tunnels should you be so willing."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, lad," he claps Dieter on the shoulder.  "I'd love to hear your tale.  Myself, I've been tracking these here orcs.  Got away from me for a bit, but when I heard the commotion, I came as fast as I could."  To Maouelue, "Sorry I couldn't have been here before you fell, fella."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"...  Aye?  Indeed some interesting magics.  Okay, I won't be surprised if I'm left by my lonesome in the morn'!"  He puts out a hand.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue rests by the fire watching the flames. He relaxes his mind into its usual meditative sequence, going over the events of the day, then casting them toward the stars in his mind's eye. Here in the dark cavern, his memory of starlight is lifeblood. Life...he considers this a moment...his run ins with death... These musings form a blip in his usual steady trance. The scene of Briffo's burial blends with the stars. His song comes in and bends its drifting lines, tracing constellations. Now slowly a low hiss grows and distorts the glorious notes, a cruel laugh, darkness begins to set in. Then a flash of platinum blue sears the scene...there is only one constellation, burning radiantly wavering obscuring all else. An outline only visible in the relief of pure light begins to resolve...The vision of divine justice, of good, the king of dragons....Bahamut's form sears itself into the mind's eye. Maouelue is no longer controlling this meditation, this is something else...A silent voice in his head speaks. It says to him simply, "Life." Then the form turns and begins to alight back to the stars, the form now more visible in the new relief of darkness, the void of space feeling ever deeper than ere it has. As Bahamut set wing to space, the last fleeting glimpse before he took flight was dimmed only by a spectral Briffo, nestled in the crook of a wing, looking out over the vast expanse. He lifts a platinum lute and strikes a final chord, fleetingly winking back into Maouelue's eye. Then....it's all gone. The darkness of the abyss becomes the shadows of the cavern receding to the flickering flames of the fire. Maouelue comes to changed. He knows now in his heart he must use his power to bolster the forces of good and channel his power into life. He stands, a new radiance seems to emit from him, awe inspiring, yet distancing. This new strength seems to come at the cost of a certain kind of knowability, but not loyalty or honesty.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This hunt for the Muhlen sisters is no longer a curiosity. It is a divine decree. Let the roots of evil be laid low for their treachery though the purification of the very soil to which it has taken root.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As he rises, he looks at the frenchmen, their new brethren. He holds a hand to each of their shoulders and says a prayer. He traces the mark of Bahamut in his minds eye as they disappear back into the ether...back into the mirror. A sad, yet pure knowing sets over him as he begins to don the now-empty plate mail. He affixes the Giantess Bracers and Frostbitten Helm. He sets his scabbard to his waist and picks up Frenchy's dagger. Digging around in his pack for a moment, he pulls out a stray piece of silver ore that must have settled to the bottom during their journey. Holding it over the fire with the dagger, he warms the metal and it drinks in the firelight. Bringing it back out, he sets it on the Shield of Disruption and begins shaping it into a draconic form. A symbol for his new devotion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he's melding the silver, the feeling of a human hand rests on his shoulder.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Holy...!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns, expecting to see the stranger from the fight before.  Instead, he sees a blond man, ethereal, radiating powerfully bright aura around him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your faith will be your reward.  Know that I will be here, watching over you.  When you most need me, look to the East, look for your patron."</p><p>He touches your shoulder, sending radiant energy through the wizard's body.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he disappears, and Maouelue looks back to the shield, you sense the metal is different now.  On closer inspection...  the metal dragon is platinum.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>An ebullition of all proportions sears into the cavity in Maouelue's chest, swelling him from his very core outward. A divine pride and devotion seem to reinforce the very sinews of his being. He picks up the shield and slings it over his left arm. His fingers grip the hilt of the sword and he unsheathes it, holding it point upward directly between his eyes. He lets the firelight bend off the sharpened edges of his sword into the back of his mind. Then he stands his silent vigil over the camp.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I knew I wanted him to be ever changed by the series of deaths he has witnessed.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Right, right."  He rips something from the orc's hide, wipes his knife on the dead creature's ragged clothing, and sheaths it.  He puts the hide patch into his pack, then points E.  "A bit of a walk thata way is a stone entrance, 'bout 3 feet wide, 7 foot tall, aye?  All I know about it about seven or eight of those bastards guarding it.  The orcs that came through here got into a scrape with them, couldn't quite see if they finished all of the snakies, but that might be a good place to start for the day?"</p>
