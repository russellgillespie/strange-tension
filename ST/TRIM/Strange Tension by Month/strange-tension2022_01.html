<p>(Should be...  I'm at work now, so I can't update it here.  But the pbp should be good, and I have a map I'm working off-line with, so...)</p>

<p>(Dieter and co are in the far right room.)</p>

<p>(Going to hop on my computer in a little bit and I‚Äôll be able to get down on it today! Stoked to wild shape and scintillating shell!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sqwaaaaaak!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(OMG this fucking citadel!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's a bigg'n!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around the room at his faithful menagerie and beams with pride at their handling of the arcanist.</p><p>"Let us all take a moment to calm our nerves and take stock here. Jaecob, what do you make of this place?"</p>

<h3>Avrae ‚Äì Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae ‚Äì Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dodgy place..."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Best to keep moving."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agreed..." says Dieter as he notes the myriad exits to the room. "Best start to the left." he states as he proceeds to the Southwest door.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He presses his ear lightly to the surface, wary of what the next foul challenge might be, before pushing the door open.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That is the direction you've just came from, by the way.  To recap, you all woke up from a slumber in the illithid disection vault.  After fighting off some kobolds, you made your way through several areas eventually getting to a hall with a illiti-dragon statue.  Moving through the hall and side passageways, you all converged on the door and defeated the arcanist.  The unexplored sections are to the E - which is actually N I just couldn't flip the picture!  If you compare it to Roll20, you'll see it should be flipped 90 degrees counterclockwise.  Sorry...  the next pics I get I'll try to orient them correctly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door swings wide and the hall you just came from stands empty.  A few doors down that hall are closed.  A trail of flail snail slime tracks from the far passage right into the room you're currently in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just for expiditious purposes, most of the rooms there are store rooms with nothing much in them.  There is one - blacked out on the map - that has something of note, if you'd like to explore.  Otherwise, the doorways to the E are your best way forward.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh ok. i was looking at the R20 version so it would have been the door across from the stairs to the left that I was trying to enter. Not sure if that scans, but I'll go to the room of interest that you mention.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group opens the door, a soft glow illuminates the room.  The smell of dried blood - a pungent iron/metal smell - hits them all.  On the walls are racks of torture equipment along with various instruments for medical experimentation.  In the middle of the room, situated above a round, grated hole in the floor, is a strange table with holes in it, like a sieve.  Atop it, a familiar sight - a human dissected just like the illithid in the vault room; a Y incision splits the man's thoracic cavity and various organs have been shifted around and searched through.</p><p></p><p>As the light comes on, slowly, the human...  blinks.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dear DEKU!" Dieter shouts as he reels back from the startling movement.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Jaecob, meanwhile, lets out a long low groan of wearied resolve. "Here we go again."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Flayco on the other hand, bobbles over to the splayed form and begins sniffing and licking intently.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group maneuvers in the room, assessing the scene, they can all see the man is pinned down in several areas.  His head is lashed to a headrest at the forehead and around his neck with what look to be metallic clasps that intricately link to the table.  There are more clasps on his arms and legs, and two large metal pieces sticking out from his hips.  The folds of his chest-skin are pinned to the table as well.  As Flayco starts licking the man's appendages, his fingers and toes react, but only slightly, as if there was a disconnect in the transmission of the impulse.  He blinks again, a bit faster now.  His mouth moves awkwardly, but no sound comes out.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>While Dieter stares agog in disgust, Jaecob moves with resolute grit, pulling out his dagger and in one swift motion, laying the poor soul to rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Attack roll, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter watches the scene unfold as if in a trance, unable to muster the call for Jaecob to halt.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gracious act from Jaecob is met with an unexpected hitch.  As the dagger lances into the man's jugular, the entire form on the table <i>pops</i> as if a bubble was burst.  Acidic slime bursts onto Muhlen's hands, dealing him 6 points of acid damage, but not poisoning him further.  The goo-man rushes through the sieve holes and down the grate in the floor, burbling all the way down.  </p><p></p><p>Left on the table is a small, purple/white crystal, about an inch long.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Picking up the still slick crystal, it pulses with radiant light - for just a split second - when the druid touches it.  Unfortunately, though, he can't quite grasp what it's all about.  It seems like a normal crystal one would find in a cave somewhere.  With the exception of the radiant light part.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The table is alien to this world, Jaecob can tell that from as close as he is.  The material it's made of is completely foreign to him.  Looking around at the implements, Dieter can see most of them are cleanm unused.  A couple of the medical implements, however, are red with blood.  An odd flask, with an amber liquid filled about halfway, stands near some of the instruments, its top off.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Jaecob, a man hewn from tougher stuff than might be put off by such a grisly scene, heads over to the flask, lowering himself to it and drawing in a waft.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Smells acrid, biting.  A preservative of some sort?  (Perception for more!)</p>

<h3>Avrae ‚Äì Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid can tell it's for keeping something, especially organs and tissues, from the ravages of deterioration.  But whatever was added to it might either enhance or degrade the effects?  Or there could be a magical component to the micture, but it's hard to say without further experimentation.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmmph...better stopper this and keep it safe." he says, stowing the bottle now in his pack. "Gods be damned this place...."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Shaking his increasingly scruffly head, it had been a long time since he'd had a shave, Dieter heads back out of the room cursing, then looks dead on at the staircase ahead. "Are you ready, friends, to follow me to whatever end?"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sqwaaaaak!"</p><p>"Schluuurpp!!"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Grmph..."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Alright then. <i>Follow me.</i>"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves determinedly to the next destination, wondering if the Elf fared any better at this particular moment. <i>What would he have made of this?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Taking the NE door, the hallway leads to a curved wall and another door, slighly left ajar.  As soon as the first door is open, sounds of scuffling and scraping can be heard from the room beyond.  Yelling in a gutteral language and occasional yipping is heard, too, creating quite a din.  (No need to roll stealth, but if you want to check and see what's in the room, roll a sleight of hand, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter turns back to his crew and raises a finger to his lips as he crouches just a bit and sidles up to the door to take a peek.</p>

<h3>Avrae ‚Äì Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door is only open a slight bit, and the number of beasts and creatures inside can't be figured.  But there are some large beasts...  and some creatures possibly training them.  And, amazingly enough, just beyond the crazed action of matted hair and green-grey bodies running amok, Dieter can see a lowered drawbridge and it's mechanism...  and grey stone beyond, a glint of sunlight - <i>real</i> sunlight - splashing on a crag several hundred feet beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed be the light‚Ä¶‚Äù Dieter lets out a sigh of relief. He takes a moment to check himself over, patting down his various pockets and bags.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>‚ÄúStay here and wait for my signal,‚Äù he says the group, then lifts his left hand and touches his golden ring. His form dissipates into nothingness and the door opens gently.</p>

<p>(Roll20 is updated, btw!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh hey, didn‚Äôt see your reply.)</p><p>Dieter pulls back the door just far enough to squeeze through, then begins to move across the span and assess the masses for a potential plan, a potential route through. If they could just reach the bridge‚Ä¶</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It might be tough because not only are there a couple rough looking goblins, but they're training two very large animals...</p>

<p>(No worries, sorry...   two gobs and two barghests.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 is utd.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Sensing now the closest thing to freedom he has seen in a long time, Dieter makes his move. He whispers back through the door to his crew, "Jaecob, be ready with your swords. Flayco, this time it's your turn to shine. Shelli...guard the door here." And with this, he moves off to the right side of the room, still invisible, preparing his energies for what is to come.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Jaecob: "Bloody hell..."

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Before Jaecob can protest further, Flayco flops in and follows his person's orders. Squawking and making a grotesque yet comical scene as he enters into the room.</p>

<p>Feeling as though the door is securely fastened, and not hearing the animal from beyond the threshold moving about, a calm comes over the group.

<p>Well past the point of needing a breather, Dieter urges the group to sit for a moment before investigating further. He passes out what is left of the restoratives and passes out some rations.

<p>Dieter walks over to the square and addresses it while Jaecob tends to raking the room for anything useful.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The off-colored rectangle in the middle of the door is non-descript, aside from it's different color than the rest of the door.  All of it has a dull metallic sheen to it, and the rectangle is darker that the rest.  The map is available for the taking (or inspection), as well as the potions on the wall.  There's also the individual potion ingredients strewn about the room, you can do a survival check to find out what you can get there.  (Or let me know if you're looking for something specific and I can let you know if it's there.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter strolls over and gives the map to Jaecob for a closer look while taking his time going over the nature of the alchemical supplies.</p>

<p>There are quite a few things here that are ingredients for health potions.  With that check, Dieter can get enough for 2 standard or 1 greater.</p>

<p>"We had better take our time here getting ready. Who knows when we'll be able to breathe next." Dieter intones ominously which is met with a gruff acquiescent grunt from Muhlen junior.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sets about his work, thinking back to the priestess of Ilmater all that while ago and of the deadly chase of the Muhlen sisters... <i>Jaecob...</i></p><p></p><p>"I...I am sorry Jaecob. I'm not sure if we've ever discussed what happened...to your...father's favorite daughters..."</p>

<p>The map is a detailed crosssection of the underdark, or at least certain strategic locations.  Several cities are mentioned - Menzoberranzan, Earth's End, Gauntlgrym, Blingdenstone, Sloopdilmonpolop - but the biggest one, a section with a giant circle around it, is the <i>Fallen City of Asharladon</i>.</p><p></p><p>The potions are - standard health potion, potion of clairvoyance, and potion of scrying.  </p><p></p><p>Lastly, it's unclear as to what needs to be done with the door, but it looks really solid.</p>

Jaecob: "You know somethin' about my sisters?  Which ones?"

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Veena...Hozieh..."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter shifts uncomfortable in his stance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah, them.  Ye kill 'em?"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Taken aback at the matter-of-fact tone, Dieter stumbles to a few nods and grunts. "I am sorry."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nah, don't be.  They've been tryin' to kill me for years.  Why else do ya think I'm hiding around down here, gatherin' my own army?  They were always tryin' to take control of the Runemark legacy, along with Wilm.  Shits, all of 'em.  Here's the question, though...  ye sure they're dead?"  He winks at you, goodnaturedly.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter‚Äôs uncomfortable shifting takes on a new tone. <i>Could he be sure? Everything was- is such a blur now.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>"Not me.  Staying the hell away from there, if I can help it.  I ever tell you about my time with the giants?"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>‚ÄúGo on‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(He's genuine.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Where we got our family name from, "The Runemark".  See, my father, that rat bastard, sailed the Sea of Swords all the way across the world.  Legends say he went to Maztica, some say he fell of the side of the world, others mention a portal that took him to the island of the giants.  Whichever way he got there, he got there.  He used to tell us that he was stranded, all of his crew gone, and the giants were about to kill him when he offered them a scroll of wish...  Bullshite if ye ask me, but any way ye cut it, he came back from that situation with the knowledge of giant runes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Those things are inherently magic, and he could have been an artificer or enchanter, maybe even an evoker...  but what does he do?  Writes on lead and copper pieces a rune that turns them into gold!  And it's an illusion spell, so it doesn't actually <i>change</i> anything, just make 'em look like gold!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Rat bastard.  Created a whole business with those coins.  Traded with 'em, built a merchant empire...  No doubt if you head back to the sea, you'll maybe see a few pass through your pockets.  And people are none the wiser.  Not to say they aren't really what they seem, I guess.  But with all of that power, all of that magical acumen, what does he do?  Swindle and rob.  Great legacy, eh?  Now you know why I'd've just traded in the Runemark magic when it passed to me.  Who knows what would've happened if my sisters or brother would've gotten it, though.  Maybe it's for the best."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shrugs and meanders off to look at the 'metal' door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Anyway, there's a story in my family that a huge trove of real treasure is buried on the sea.  Under that guise, I hired a crew and sailed the Sea myself, kinda tryin' to find the treasure island...  but really, I was shootin' fer a way back to the isle of the giants...  And I found it!  When I got there, only a few giants were left, actually.  There was a small tribe of about seven or eight, and no youngins.  Their magic was still strong, though, and so I tried to barter with them for the magical knowledge.  They had heard about my father, and since that time have never offered their magics up to 'off-landers', they said.  I told them I understood, but since I was there, since I actually found the place, I wasn't going back empty handed.  They were unwilling to leave the island, even though it looked like they would be extinct in a matter of time.  I offered to bring more of their kind to the island, which they took to immediately.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So, that's how I became a giant runner.  At first, I would go out with a crew of adventurers - mercenaries, really - and we would capture giants and relocate them to the island.  That only worked two times.  The first one was pretty stupid, so he took to the relocation fine, but the second...  was a fighter!  Almost killed the whole crew when he woke up mid-trip!  We got it into our heads that we could find giants and let them know about the solitary island, and that worked much better.  And eventually, as the tribe grew, they offered me my reward...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He pulls up his shirt to show a large runic tattoo laced around his back that goes around his side and travels up to his shoulders.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"They wouldn't tell me what it does, but I've been dyin' to know!  They said if I came back with more of their kinfolk, they would share the meanings of some of them.  Matter of fact, I was tryin' to find some when I ran into this craziness with my brother creating the 'Runemark Army' and taking over the local areas.  Not sure if I'm going to make it out of this, but if I do...  Maybe I'll just find a wizard to tell me what these things mean.  But there's no way I'm going back to the water, not any more.  Got a bad feeling about all of it.  Feels like tempting fate if I were to sail again."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stands still a long while soaking this in. His minds eye floats outward across Mount Hotenow passing the Sword Coast and out to the Trackless Sea and boarding a Northbound ship. Cold winds pull harshly across patchy stubble as the winds of Winter whisper in early. Off in the distance, somewhere through an icy mist, a land of deep magic and mysterious creatures‚Ä¶</p><p></p><p>His gaze returns to the room and Jaecob then down to the tattoo. He chuckles a bit and says, ‚ÄúThought you‚Äôd go back and do the thing <i>properly</i>, huh?‚Äù</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Maybe.  Maybe I was just hoping for more...  just, more.  More than my father.  Rat bastard.  Thing is, I received the Runemark legacy as we were coming back into port; Luskan actually, and...  well...  A part of me knows what my tattoo <i>could</i> do...  I think.  It's complicated.  But I can use some giant runes, I just...  don't know how I do them.  Does that make any sense?  Sometimes...  I think I'm crazy, ya know?"</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen ‚Äì Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Yeah, I'm probably crazy."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>‚ÄúFriend, this whole damned world is crazy. But you‚Äôre the one I‚Äôve got right here and  now and I‚Äôm none to judge. I‚Äôve‚Ä¶made my choices in life‚Ä¶‚Äù something dark seems to swim across Dieter‚Äôs eyes as he says this. There is a sadness there that Jaecob hadn‚Äôt marked before. </p><p>‚ÄúAnyway, maybe you could do something with this here stumper. Perhaps those runes will come of use as we try to unwind the dread knot your father has tied us all into.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen ‚Äì Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Hope so.  Not sure about everything down here, it seems like a whole new world.  Makes me wonder what he actually got hisself into.  Like, the agreement with the Yuan-ti to ressurect the Great World Serpent is one thing, but these guys...  that <i>thing</i> that was torn apart in the chamber...  Not sure what to do with all this information, eh?"</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen ‚Äì Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Like this door.  These markings are totally foreign.  Do you recognize them?  Maybe from my father's crazy book?"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter thinks back to the book, it's writing coherent at first, but then deteriorating to the scrawl of a madman. <i>Do I? Do I remember?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The book that was found to help decipher the illithid writing.  Helped you guys get into the vault.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter searches his trusty bag for his book storage area and while rooting around finds a few flecks or rotten snake hide from so long ago. He smiles, nostalgically thinking about Vam and Heston, then turns his attention back to the matter at hand. He finds the tome and pulls it out, rereading and scanning for any passages that might speak of this.</p>
