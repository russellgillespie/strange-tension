<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’ll do perc then see if I get down to inv)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All of the suits of armor are frost-rimed, about 7 ft tall, and each carry a long bastard sword at various stages of presentation.   There are five more, the alcoves they are in only have room for the armor.  They are all still immobile.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dripping gets louder as you move farther S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They walk on down the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Elkamigo and Maouelue make their way through the corridor, passing into the room with the frozen monster...  which is slowly losing its frost covering.  This is where the dripping sound has been coming from, as a small puddle has formed underneath the creature.   It's antennae are sticking out, completely clear, and a portion of it's head is barren, yet the majority of the monster is encased.  </p><p></p><p>The giant elk moves slowly past the creature, seeing it's eyes following the pair.  Maouelue takes his eyes from the beast back down the W hall to the pool room...  and realizes something.  This is where Bellatrix and Benna were.  Yet, upon further inspection of the immediate area, they are nowhere to be found.  The dripping quickens.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue hops down from the furry frame and indicates for Elkamigo to back up into the entryway as he comes closer to inspect the beast.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature for the animal type.  Investigation for...  other things!  Please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The creature's name escapes him, but Maouelue definitely remembers that these beasts live in the ice and snow - usually under it, as a matter of fact - and ambush their victims.  With that knowledge, looking around on the floor the mage sees bits of different types of armor and weapons frozen underneath the massive worm-like thing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There seems to be a orange-red glow coming from the creatures chest, too.  Deep withing the thing itself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the water melting off the form, was this the magical sort or the other? He takes no chances, quickly attempting to form the water once again into a cage of ice spikes surrounding the creature.</p><p>[Shape Water]</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He then reaches out with his feelings, trying to sense the creature’s conscience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Go ahead and cast the spell, it'll conform to what you're looking to do.  What/How are you connecting to the creature's consciousness?   Or did I misread that?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I will peer at it’s heart and try to attune to the source of heat. More sensing for reaction than trying to communicate directly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, didn't realize it was a cantrip, my bad.  Roll a Constitution saving throw, we'll see where we are with attuning to what's happening here.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage centers himself.  After a few deep breaths, he briefly thinks on Dieter and what he would do in this situation.  One more deep breath, and he squeezes his eyes close and reaches out with his feelings, with his emotions...  and finds an inferno of pain an anger raging in front of him.  The fire seems to be intensifying, while the emotions of the beast are lashing out at him, even in this amorphous state.  Maouelue feels the hate the creature has for anything humanoid, especially giant-kin.  It's especially fearful of the suits of armor, of which it believes Maouelue is a part of.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's eyes fling open as it mentally begins showing the mage what it plans to do with anything it encounters when it is freed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Calm your anger ancient one. I am not your keeper, and we need not come to blows. I sense your hatred for this frozen place, your heartsfire makes this plain. Let me show you my intentions are noble.”</p>

<p>The internal fire burns brighter as the creature's eyes start to take on the orange glow.   It stays immobile, however, as large sections of ice melt away from it, slowly freeing it from it's prison.</p><p></p><p>(Are you continuing to cast 'Command'?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Find...the...sisters....” he gasps as he falls prone again against the antlers.</p>

<p>(Constitution save, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue gets close to passing out, but keeps the blackness on the edge of his periphery at bay.  As the mage made his escape through the area, he can't recall passing his other two companions.  And he can't hear anything now, save for very distant grinding of ice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Elkamigo looks around wildly as he approaches the center room, unsure of which way to go around the circle, yet keen to avoid the all-too-familiar ice block in the center. He turns left, somehow out of force of habit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair make their way yet again around the circular room, heading off into the last hallway they haven't checked yet.  It leads to a set of stairs, then doubles back on itself to another set.  It repeats this a few times more, always climbing upwards and doubling back on itself.  Finally, Elkamigo and Maouelue are led into a corridor which branches into two halls.  East leads into a small room with a solid block of ice covering the entire eastern wall.  North has a few alcoves with more suits of armor in them, ending in another hall leading north.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Afk soccer.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you." says the chastened mage to his furry fey friend. "I...I...would be <i>gone</i> without you..." Tears begin to fall from the Sylvan's darkened eyes, crystalline as the freeze upon his face. "I've nearly lost everything now.... The sisters! Oh where could they be?"</p><p></p><p>He slumps down and Elkamigo nestles in to the corner bay to their South, propping up the miserable mage, who goes about tending to his wounds.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The chill begins to reach its way into the heart of the Dragon Mage. He teeters on the edge of consciousness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halls up here echo with a faint breeze, coming from the north corridor.  Maouelue, as he's healing and taking a moment to gather his bearings, can hear the groaning of the castle below him, seemingly shifting on it's moorings.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He peers warily at the suits of armor, unsure if he could take another onslaught at the moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The armor looks exactly like the ones downstairs, just not animated.... yet.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
Maouelue: 38/55

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Bedraggled, the mage summons what's left of his spirit to at least try and prepare for the encounters ahead.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aaaaaahhhhh now that’s the stuff! I’m a bit low on my mana reserves but I’ll mana-ge... eh? eh? Oh right, you’re just a beast...I wonder where those sisters could be. Bella might not have liked it, but I <i>know</i> Benna would have at least guffawed.... Oh listen to me prattling on...”</p><p></p><p>He gathers himself and pushes on with Elkamigo through the rows of armor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The suits of armor do not make a sound as the metal mage lumbers through the corridor, the loud <i>clack</i> of his amigo's hooves bouncing around the room.  A right turn at the end of the hall leads to another corridor running E, ending in a right turn.  Midway down, a left 90 degree turn leads into a fog-shrouded room.  Not much can be seen from the entrance to this room, and no noise greets the pair as they approach.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue gets a little dirt off his shoulder and begins to weave, swirling the fog around the room and sucking it into a vortex where it dissipates at the center.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Appearing in the middle of the cleared room is another block of ice, identical to the others.  No frost coats the walls or floors here, this room is rough stone bricks, as that of a castle.  The temperature of this room is very nearly pleasant.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage steps forward, now expecting another place to put his hand.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches forward, placing his hand on the ice block.  The fog reappears around him slowly, emerging from the ground.  Then he notices the block is no longer in front of him...  and that the fog is swirling around.  The swirls become small eddies, combining, colliding into each other.  In mere moments, the mage finds himself in a vast open space surrounded by five fog elementals!  (Before initiative, please give me a perception check!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a few, too.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There doesn't look to be a way out, at least from your vantage point currently.  The elementals are intimidating, but they are not (as of yet) acting aggressively.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Children of the fog, I am the true ancestor of Albrek. I am here to complete the trials and take my rightful place in this realm. Would you help or hinder this cause?”</p>

<p>(Persuasion check, please!)</p>

<p>They don't speak, but you get the distinct sense that this is one of the tests.  Simple fog-enshrouded weapons appear at each of their sides, and they move into a semi-circle position around the Dragon Mage.  Their red eyes flare momentarily, but they make no response.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue lays down his weapons and sits down in lotus position. He closes his eyes and begins breathing slowly. He says only this, "Discretion."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The fog monsters dissipate and start to coalesce around the meditating mage.  Maouelue feels a pressure building at his nostrils, as if the fog were trying to get in.  He is focused on his breathing, but he holds, contemplating what to do next.  (Breathing in?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He releases hold of his corporeal self, breathing in the fog and meditating on <i>becoming</i> the water, the vapor, the frost, the ice.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first breath in sends his inner vision blurring through time and space; stars and constellations, planets and their moons, all race by, filling him with awe.  The material world peels away, and after a few more deep breaths, all that exists is fog.  Vapor.  Ether.  </p><p></p><p>The ether forms into a humanoid body, coalesces more into a perfect copy of Maouelue.  It approaches and sits, cross-legged, right in front of the real mage, looking at him serenely.  </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Maouelue.  You have passed the test of peace.  This used to be the penultimate lesson for the dragon mark.  However, the test has been corrupted, Dragon Mage.  Not the whole test, just the ending.  The Prince and his cohort have used their influence to degrade and denigrate the process.  It now does not yield what you think.  It has a solution for you, but it is not what you were hoping for.  The dragon mark is not earned.  It is bestowed.  However, if you are able to defeat the Pale Prince, there might be a way to receive your boon.  Keep on the path, wizard.  You are so close to the conclusion of your quest."</p><p></p><p>With that, he disappears, and Maouelue finds himself back with the block of ice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The test of peace, defiled. Yes, that sounds just like what I have heard of this charlatan Prince. I feel sorry for him... If I must be his end... <i>sigh</i>... so be it. Though, perhaps ‘defeat’ need not mean death...more death.” With a heaving expulsion of breath, the mage comes to and re-acclimated himself to his surroundings.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silence is absolute.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A sullen, frosted voice sounds in Maouelue's ear, saying softly, <i>"That was...  unfortunate.  I was so hoping to meet you without any...  interference.  You are more capable than I presumed.  Find me, if you can.  I'm not far away.  And neither are your friends."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Did it sound in the chamber, or in his head? Reverberant or like asmr whisper?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It sounded like it was right next to his ear.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue starts a moment at the proximity of the voice, but doesn’t give in to looking. He takes a steely breath and considers this latest riddle.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He stands back up slowly and pats his amigo on the hindquarters. He leads back down out to the corridor and turns left to inspect the end of the hallway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Moving around the corner, Maouelue almost has a heart attack when he sees an enormous frost giant in the middle of the room!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then he notices the pedestal and that the being is lifted off of the floor by a foot or so, making him more imposing than usual.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The being is either dead and stuffed, or under some type of spell.  He's almost completely frosted over, but that might just be how frost giants look.  He is in full regalia, too - full giant armor and holding a gigantic shield and spear.  There is also a closed door on the E side of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk, kids going to bed.  Be back soon!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cool cool! Supper here in a moment.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back, feel free to fire when ready!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He backs away slowly, not quite ready to there...yet. He heads back around through the armor room and hangs a Lumao at the junction, inspecting the space to the East.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>... and sees a massive wall of ice.  Inside the block are beings, seemingly frozen in stasis.  The far side of the block can be seen, but just vaguely.  The block looks to be several feet thick.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks to see if there is a way around to see it from all sides.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only areas are the halls he's seen.  Nothing backs around to the other side.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He puts his hand to the ice and wipes away the rime, trying to see more clearly what, or whom lies within.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks into the depths of the ice block, peering into the miasma that becomes clearer and clearer the deeper he goes.  Bones, bits of armor, various weapons, body parts...  all suspended in the ice...  or...  it looks strange, now.  The mage moves back and forth along the length of the blockage, sussing out the contents.  There are definitive striations, vertical markings where it looks like the ice might have frozen against something.... an invisible wall of sorts.  This striation is on both sides, six feet or so from the edge of the side walls.  There doesn't seem to be horizontal striations, but the vertical definitely stand out as he moves across the surface of the ice wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue shudder, privately praying that he doesn't end up a disembodied array of items frozen in that mass of ice. He moves back around to the Giant Room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is sparse, the only furnishing is the frozen giant.  The door on the E side of the room is made of pure solid metal, something very fine (investigation check for material).  The base of the giant is frosted over, but it looks to Maouelue like there's a small plaque near the base.  There are words on the plaque, giant markings, but only the first few words and letters can be seen.  The rest are obscured by ice.</p>

<p>He investigates the door material then tries to wipe away the ice obscuring the letters.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty metal.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Can't quite tell what the door is made of.  It's definitely not made of ice, though.</p><p>The ice on the statue base will have to be removed for Maouelue to read/make sense of it.  (Mao speaks Giant, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He speaks Giant.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The first few words and letters spell out:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>"... m a giant, an anci..."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes out his knife and begins to scratch away at the icy covering, trying to reveal the rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The hoarfrost at the top is easy to scratch away, but it gets thicker toward the bottom.  A couple lines are revealed in the scratching:
*"I am a giant, an ancient king
With many a jewel by my neck are hanging"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue looks up at the king’s necklace, seeing just what these <i>jewels</i> might be.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is no necklace on the giant.  He wears no crown, either.  Just bulky armor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes out the mace, thinking to crack through the remaining ice, but takes a moment to inspect the Giant’s shield and insignia.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation and history check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The shield is of exceptional make and quality.  As is the armor and the great-axe at the giant's side.  The rimed shield does have a raised insignia, a series of runes that identify him as a bard of the frost giant ordning, who have a major place in frost giant society.  Unlike traditional bards, frost giant bards are specifically runesmiths.  Some of the runes lining the perimeter of the shield give Maouelue a twinge, but he can't put a finger on how he recognizes them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue pulls out his book of drawings and etchings comparing the runes to the Runemark and others he took down in the Muhlen Vault.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A <i>lot</i> of them match up.  Most of them, in fact.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dieter should be here...” <i>sigh</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Friend.</i> The Dragon mage utters in the Giant tongue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It stands solid and frozen in place.  No reaction.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Psh...works in all the old stories...” he adds petulantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>I bet Snarr would have gotten it...</i>” he jibes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Considering again, he thinks back to the line about the jewels around the neck. He cajoles Elkamigo over and remounts to get a better look at the top of the Giant form and to peer down inside the armor plate.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Elkamigo allows the heavy mage hop upon it's huge back, but Maouelue doesn't see any 'jewels' or anything of the like around the frost giant's neck.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Well, I didn’t want to do this...but...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He thinks a moment, “Back up Elkamigo.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He hops down and shoots a stream of flame at the placard.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
As the ice melts slowly away from the base of the giant, more runes can be seen:
*"I am a giant, an ancient king
With many a jewel by my neck are hanging
Then a monster comes, a heartless thief.
The bite so bitter brings me grief.
It takes my treasure, my riches untold,
My rubies, my emeralds, my silver, my gold.
What am I?"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Tree.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue speaks the word, the giant word resounds around the room, and the air feels like it is being drawn away.  To the E, the polished metal doors move inward, slowly, scraping against the frozen floor.  An odd green glow comes from within the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Kids bed!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns to meet the glow, the steel and platinum of his armor iridescent in reflection. He approaches the precipice and peers in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Emerald green fills the mages eyes as he peers into a modest sized room that is completely engulfed by an enormous, leafy tree.  Leaves spill over an impossibly large trunk whose roots are digging into the ice and stone of the castle.  From the base of the tree to about halfway up it's trunk is a rime of ice, threatening the life blood of the massive structure.  As the wizard looks closer, there are a few leaves, scattered here and there, that look to be frosting over as well.  Glinting near the center of the large bough system is a golden apple, a single fruit, hanging down within arms reach of the mage.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, isn't it.  You see, I stole this tree from another world, and brought it here...  just to watch it die," the feathery voice says in Maouelue's ear.  "That golden apple is the heart of a new world, or could be.  The wood from that tree can create magical items that can transport people anywhere their heart's desire.  To any plane, any space...  any life, perhaps.  One would say it's a travesty that I have imprisoned this wonderful thing in a place such as this, just to kill it.  I would prefer it did not have to happen.  But I cannot allow what it stands for.  I cannot allow it's hope to infect anyone else."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Would you like to see the last test?  Or, at least, the last test originally planned for the heir to the dragon mark?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Mage stoically nods his silent consent.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue could swear he hears a heavy sigh as a blue-white portal appears on the edge of the S wall.  Within, the mage can see a simple, yet unoccupied, tavern room.  A plain wooden table has a white cloth on it.  Maouelue can see something is underneath the cloth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage walks into the room, and as he does so, the cover dissolves away, showing the mage a series of wizard's wands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The one at the farthest left looks to be made of solid gold, set with rubies.  Next is a polished wand of a black substance, somewhere between wood and stone.   The third is an intricately carved white-wood wand, extremely ornate and delicate.  The fourth is a thick wand, made of a tough wood, and is set with small crystals and gems that twinkle. </p><p> It also has runes etched all along it.  Last is what looks to be a stick, twisted at odd angles, scarred along an edge as if from a lightning strike.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A voice comes to Maouelue - <i>"Choose."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Afk with kids for a while. Sry for stop start. )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, brother!  Enjoy the fam!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can mao read any of the runes on the fourth wand?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They're in Sylvan, so he sees...)</p><p><i>No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He reaches out and lifts the fifth wand, testing its balance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a heavy wood, weighing down his hand as he picks it up.  It surprises him, the heft of it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He closes his eyes to the material world around him and tries to connect with the source within the wand, if there indeed is any.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check, please!)</p>

<p>A deep sense of calm comes over the wizard.  The small room fades away, Maouelue soars through clouds.  Tufts of white flow by, then part to reveal an immense forest below him.  The wizard flows down further, below the clouds altogether, and close to the tops of the tallest trees.  Interspersed between the trees, at the base of seemingly <i>every</i> tree, is a pool of water...  no...  not water.  Liquid, but not...  water.   As far as Maouelue can see, the forest continues in every direction, endlessly.  </p><p></p><p>Dipping further below the boughs, Maouelue sees sparse foliage, neat grasslands, and, again, thick tree cover rolling across the entire landscape.  The pools are colored in a rainbow of hues.  The vision stops at a massive tree with a golden liquid pool beneath it.  As he looks up, Maouelue notices a golden apple on one of the highest boughs.  The vision fades back to the heavy wand in Maouelue's hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It is.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room, table, wands dissolve around Maouelue, with the wizard still holding tight to the heavy wooden wand.  He reappears in the frozen room, but this time there are noticeably less leaves on the tree.  It's nearly barren, the ice now covering the majority of the trunk and even moving onto some branches.</p><p></p><p>"It's an interesting choice, wizard.  Have you always wanted to play the martyr?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hard work and a keen intellect were the values Shi’Vandos instilled in me. Sartorial considerations and ostentation often mask a lack within. One who lives pure and true has no need to proclaim.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Strong words.  We'll see if they're still strong after we meet.  We're waiting..."  Another leaf falls from the tree.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage lifts the wand up to the golden apple and ever-so-gently touches it with the tip.</p>

<p>(Dexterity save, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The apple falls from the tree, Maouelue reaches to grab at it as it falls, but it slips through his fingers.  As it heads for the floor, just before it hits, it disappears.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“No!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks searchingly back up to its original position, hoping...</p>

<p>A few more leaves fall from the tree.  The apple doesn't reappear.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope this works...” he half prays to himself as he pulls out the small bottle he had refilled with magical sap what feels like an age ago. Once again, he dips his knife into the sap , this time coating the blade fully in the viscous liquid.</p><p></p><p>“Grow. Fight. Live.”, he implores the tree as he holds the blade point down over the exposed bark. He watches, breathless on the edge of hope, as the drops begin to fall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Enough of this charade, <i>Brother.</i> Come out and face me.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tsk, tsk...  It is a good guess, but no, Lumao.  I am not your brother.   He is far away from here.  But he was here, once.  He may be the only person who truly understands my pain.  I must admit, too, I enjoy his plans for...  correcting the imbalance.  I do have a message from him for you, though.   Shall I save it until we're face to face?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotta pause there for tonight, sir - fun stuff!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Man this is intense!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue does not reply. Instead he looks upward, assessing where these branches lead? Could he climb further yet? The old feeling of being pulled by strings of fate and power-hungry machinations roils to his core.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he comes to a determined conclusion. </p><p></p><p>This time he points the wand directly at his own heart. He grips a branch from the tree firmly and says, “I am ready.  Take me to him.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a slight chuckle, and the thin voice says, "I believe you have the wrong impression of that wand, young wizard.  But what you ask is...  curious.  I wonder..."</p><p></p><p>A few moments pass, then a circle of bluish-white appears where the door to the tavern room was before.  It widens out until the circle reaches from the top of the wall to the bottom, and stretches to fifteen feet across.  Through the door, Maouelue can see a blank white space, akin to the clouds he was just floating through.  Farther in, he can see the bottom half of a person dressed in black robes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was wondering if the power of the tree could be channeled like that.)</p><p></p><p>Maouelue moves down to meet the figure on the threshold.</p>

<p>(The tree is looking pretty grim, and it's been here for a while.  Plus, the apple was lost...  If you were looking to transport out of the keep, the Prince isn't about to let that happen, however...  we'll let the die decide...

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue descends from the tree, more of the person on the other side of the rift becomes visible.  Standing comfortably, arms tucked into the front pockets of his robes, stands a young-ish man, human by all accounts, with a scraggly black goatee and dark black, lank hair hanging down.  He has a hint of a scar on his forehead that detracts a bit from his emerald green eyes.  He does not smile, nor does he scowl.  His countenance is...  very difficult to read, actually.  His robes are a good make, black again, and underneath, what Maouelue can see, are well made - possibly nobles? - clothing.  The boots are polished and impeccably shined, although they seem to be older.  The man gives off an air of intelligence, contemplation, and just a hint of smugness.  He eyes the wizard walking towards him.</p><p></p><p>In an almost monotone, very little inflection in his voice, he starts, "I wasn't expecting to be seeing you in quite this manner, brother.  What have you gotten yourself into to have the Prince connecting us like this?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed, Brother, this was not how I expected it to be either. Funny, how everyone seems to know me already in these parts, yet, I suppose that’s natural for a rightful heir. Yes, I have come to reconcile my past with the Eladrin....,” he pauses a pregnant beat and searches deep in his pack for something, “...Father bade me deliver this to you.” He proffers the old scroll that Shi’Vandos had prepared for this very moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(And to think...we could have just walked back to the Barrow from Oakhurst!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(To think, all of this started with a one-shot!!!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He nods and obliges, a misty sadness now coming over his eyes. This was not right. It shouldn’t have been like this, here, underground. Nevertheless, who knows when he might have the chance ever again. For Bahamut’s sake, he may not live to tell the tale of this very place at all!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Upon thinking of Bahamut, there is a shiver in the tree.  It seems to be bolstered, at least momentarily.  There is an intake of breath, but it does not come from Shi'Veilan.  </p><p></p><p>The dark man on the other side reads, nodding.  After a time, he looks up to Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>"Have you read this, brother?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(He's offering, so it's totally your call.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(You're holding it up, he's just proffering it to you.)
(Insight check if you want more of his though process.)

He nods, saying, "Respectable.  Not something I would have done, but commendable nonetheless.  I would like to understand why it is I was summoned here - if it was pure curiosity or something more - but first I would like to make one thing absolutely clear:  We are brothers in name only.  As far as I have thought of or regarded our father, he is the seed from whence I've come, nothing more.  Any thought to my 'mission' or honoring his 'legacy' is complete idiocy and I would stem it sooner rather than later.  My search for the dragon marks and their history is purely my own.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't play any part in it.  Whatever happened in the past is the past.  For now at least.  If I am able to put the events in the right order, however, you're after the dragon mark.  Father told you it was our lineage.  And since there was no word of a mad mage gallivanting around with the mark, he thought I failed?  Or had he known from the start it was a fool's errand?  Either way, it seems he's convinced you, for blood or glory, to do what he would not.  Have you realized the truth yet, Lumao?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"A wise fool once told me that we are all pawns in the game of life. Perhaps that is so. What motivation would you give me otherwise to bestill the words of the man that I know?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Words are meaningless - I would urge you to judge with your eyes.  What have you <i>seen</i> of your father so far, hmm?  Told you of his existence well into your life, only to set you on a path he would not dare tread?  Inform you of a history, a family you've never known only to rip it all away from you the next second?  You're not the first he's done this to, and you will not be the last.  He is the basest form of evil - a truly selfish man without compulsion to be better.   Yet he would dangle his 'legacy' over other's heads as a treasure, only to lead them down a primrose path.  </p><p></p><p>"No, I would not give you motivation based on words, lies, Lumao.  I would instead have you see what end your father has brought you to.  There are but two ways out of this tower - one is death; the other is owing the Pale Prince.  Either are shackles, and there is no boon to gather.  All is villainy and woe.  This was set from the start.  You and I were but a sacrifice, an offering from our dear father.  I only hope, one day, that I can repay his favor."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A tear begins to fall from Maouelue’s left eye. It freezes before it hits his trembling lips. He had never felt so cold before. Here in the dark, in the churn once again, those cold brutal words take hold in a deep recess of Maouelue’s spirit. He stifles a croak before he replies, “Thank you brother. I see the truth in your words. I understand your anger. May we meet again some day, somewhere that the Summer’s light still reaches.” A beat, then, “There is however one thing I hold that is truly mine own and of which no circumstance shall leave me bereft...</p><p></p><p><i>Hope.</i></p><p></p><p>Goodbye Shi’Veilan. May the light of the Eldar find you again.”</p><p></p><p>With this, Lumao Albrek turns away to face his fate. </p><p></p><p>“Come Prince. Let us end this.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The monotone delivery of his brother's words still in his head, Maouelue feels more than sees the messaging portal vanish.  Looking back on the tree, it still has a handful of leaves on it, but the ice has fully invaded the bulk of the branches now.  In the outer room, Maouelue hears a loud scraping sound, of stone on stone.</p><p></p><p>As he peers back into the statue room, the frost giant is slowly rotating, showing a recess underneath the floor.  The statue comes to a halt, and a spiral staircase starts rising into view.  It curls up, up, touching the ceiling and moving through is, as if through an illusion.  Moments later, the stairs come to a halt.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue, like the tree beside him, feels so very close now. Maybe his release will finally come. He resigns himself to the ascent.</p><p></p><p>“I’m glad Dieter isn’t here to see this.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue takes his first step up the staircase, he hears a crackling behind him.  His head snaps over to see a blond haired man in a brilliant platinum breastplate, short red half cape on his back, bending over and examining the fallen leaves at the base of the tree.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Does he look like Bahamut from under the Vault or does he appear different.?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Could it be?” Maouelue turns back to his patron and genuflects. “Master, of all the times and all the places, you are most welcome here. I am slipping on the brink of failure. I pray for your guidance, oh lord of Dragons.”</p>

<p>He chuckles, softly.  "Tis a long and storied history, in truth.  There once was a being who desired a hallmark, of sorts, from his travels through the planes.  It came upon a golden pool, and a tree that grew nearby.  So fascinated by the tree it looked upon it for ages.  As if granting a wish, the being stared long enough to see a single golden apple appear.  The apple was plucked, the being went off.  Soon after, the being was hungry and ate the apple.  Not wanting to waste the precious seeds, he planted the core in his own garden, which was magical.  The tree grew, sans pool of course.  As it grew, the being looked for another delicious apple to grow.  But nothing happened, and the being grew frustrated with his souvenir.  As time went by and the tree refused to bear any fruit, the being became angrier and angrier.  Eventually, incensed at his prize, he ordered the tree cut down, and to have it made into a variety of different items."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A limb of the tree went to a wand maker of particular lore.  With a core as the heart-string of an ancient platinum dragon, the Wand of Celestia was born.  It has some peculiar properties, mostly healing and the like.  Legend says it has special properties for certain carriers, as well.  Either way, I should dare say it will help you in a bind," he says with a wink.</p><p></p><p>He moves to the tree.  "And what are we to do with you, old friend?"</p><p>(Religion check on the wand, if you want!)</p>

<p>(That's super dope)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I... I tried to care for the apple, but," replies Maouelue, now voicing his deep concern for the first time, "I dropped the golden apple. Have I doomed it at last?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man turns to you and smiles, puts a hand on your shoulder.  Maouelue feels a warmth emanating from the man into his very soul, a peace that passes all understanding.  </p><p></p><p>"No, young one.  You have not doomed this tree or yourself.  I dare say you might still find it in this tomb.  Take heart.  And know that we are with you always.  Is there anything you would ask before you go forward in your quest?"</p>

<p>"What  can you tell me of the Pale Prince?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Much...  and not much at all.  His history before this place is well known.  He is the son of Oberon and Titania, fell in love with a mortal.  When she learned of what he truly was, she demanded he make her immortal, too.  Surprisingly, he told he he could not, and she spurned him.  She went off to become one of the most feared witches in all of the planes.  While he...  he slipped into a deep depression that never left him.  It became him, made his world.  He was transfixed with pain and loss, and his world changed with him.  His parents hadn't the heart to truly exile him from the Feywild, but he would not be again allowed within the walls of Astrazalian, or even on the island at all.  He closed himself off within this prison of pain, and that's where his known story ends.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"One more thing do I know, however.  There was a lich that visited this realm some time ago, when he...  it was just gaining power.  Every dragon mark has a signature.  True carriers of the marks can feel the presence of others.  Very few true dragon marks exist in the universe or among the planes currently.  False ones, however, carry their own...  stench.  If a dragon mark is specifically used for dark magic, the Five can feel it.  This place has been the core of a dark-essence dragon mark for some time now.  We know not what it is being used for, or why it was put here in the first place.  There have only been two known usages of this mark... and I would be interested to know who and why they've been used before.  Our sight is clouded from such things.  As powerful as we are," he says, smiling again.</p><p>(Full rest, btw!  From him touching you.)</p>

<p>Maouelue smiles back now. The first time he's felt truly inclined to do so in quite some time now. As the warm blood runs back to his face, the frozen tear begins to melt then trickles down, leaving its salty evidence upon Lumao's lips.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for always being here."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage nods his heartfelt appreciation to the Messenger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The blond man purses his lips, looks hard at the Dragon Mage.  Then he nods slightly and closes his eyes.  A golden light, soft and almost imperceptible, surrounds him for a moment.  He opens his eyes, regards Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>"The last I was able to see, he was entering in a small chamber...  an examination room of sorts.  I should warn you, time in the Feywild is a trick unto itself.  It could very well be that there is much to his tale after this point.  However, this is the last image I was able to see of him... and his cohorts."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Wand in hand, Maouelue begins to ascend the long and winding stair. Not to be left standing there, he brings himself to the Prince’s door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice reference!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue ascends, his padding makes no sound.  Softly, he climbs.</p><p></p><p>The stairs end in a door made of solid, clear ice.  Inside the ice can be seen a multitude of bones, stripped clean and bleached white.  The ice is about a foot thick, but as the mage puts a hand on it, it moves silently inward.  </p><p></p><p>The space within is monstrously long, ending in a throne made completely of bones and frozen over.  Atop it sits a very white, emaciated being.  It has dark black hair, sunken beady eyes, and wears a lopsided crown of silver.  The Prince wears long, blue-white robes of a shimmery material.  He sits on the edge of the throne, waiting, tense.  Not looking straight ahead, he appears to be studying a hovering, shifting thing off to his left.  There is a similar object to his right, and a monstrous shard of crystalline ice behind him.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue realizes, if he can see details at this distance, the Pale Prince must be very large.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hail, Pale Prince. So we meet face to face at last. Tell me, is all of your despair and treachery worth the cost? Would you not instead seek healing and repentance? Is your spirit indeed so far gone that all you care to do is watch things die?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Then, my pity is yours, whether you would have it or not. Would you care for a final release?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"So be it."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Pale Prince  rises to look at Maouelue at the end of the hall.  The Prince waves a hand and the hovering objects to the side of him become clear to the mage.  Hanging suspended above the ground, encased in an icy cocoon of sorts, are Benna and Bellatrix.</p>

<p>Maouelue takes in the  chaos surrounding him, death, decay, sadness. For a moment his mind flickers to a Black Dragonborn, flying high on eagle’s back screaming into an unnatural storm. His vision returns to his love, his <i>family</i>...he sees, is it an illusion? Douglas...Culver...Briffo...</p><p></p><p>“Starlight strike true!”</p>

<p>(How would you like to do this?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The magical bow seems to draw in all of the spectres as Maouelue does the string, it’s very wood grain glistening a pearlescent aura, blinding. As he releases the nocked arrow, all of the light from the bow and room together  streams into it, tracing across the room in a trail of stardust. The pitiful Prince’s darkness complete, he sees not his fate arriving. It strikes in the hollowest point of his decrepit being, the heart, piercing the failing globe, whistling an ancient dragonsong in the shimmering acoustics of the room, holy overtones of divine retribution singing the end of this pestilential source. As the arrow strikes, all becomes silent. A low howl begins to swirl and erupt from the deep recesses beneath the frozen facade, wretched now in the gloom, sundering the very ground beneath him as he falls, shattering into a million icy crystals, melding with the frost around him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a massive creaking sound as the Prince first falls, then shatters.  A definitive chill seems to lift, warmth coming back into the chamber from some unseen source.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ice knives holding the sisters melt into the floor, releasing their bodies to the ground.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A long low breath releases from the very depths of Maouelue’s diaphragm, one he had perhaps been holding their entire time in the Feywild. An ancient anxiety, at last quelled and resolved. He takes a moment to recover himself, then dashes to the unconscious sisters and begins applying his life sustaining magicks to stabilize them.</p>

<p>Maouelue moves closer to the onyx gem, and it is as large if not larger than himself.  Standing 7 feet tall, about 3 feet wide, and jagged all over, it looks to be more than the mage can handle, physically.  (Arcana and history checks, please!)</p>

<p>Stress and concern for his friends overwhelms Maouelue's senses, closing him off from his arcane wisdom, however he does remember two things in the tumult - Aenier requested the crystal be destroyed, and there is supposed to be a portal in this room that links to the throne room of the Queen of Air and Darkness.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue, not quite ready for such an encounter, moves back to his direly injured friends and priorities their well-being for the moment. He works with Jerry to take them back downstairs to the tree room, also curious about its condition now the Prince’s magic has been rent.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wolf deftly maneuvers the spiral stairs, knowing the precious cargo on his back. At the bottom of the staircase, the frozen frost giant has toppled, leaving bits of giant scattered hither and yon.   The base is still intact, and there is a trapdoor where the giant would be standing.  In the tree room, the massive limbs are thawing, ice water is dripping from the trunk in thick rivulets, pooling on the stone floor.  The floor, Maouelue notices, is lined with small cracks and s lacking much of it's frost rime.  The castle shakes again, ominously.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Seeing the peril they are all in, Maouelue scarpers his plans of getting any rest right now. He looks at the tree, hopeful, yet cautious. He seeks to quickly but carefully take a cutting from one of the livelier branches with a thought to graft it later, hopefully saving the majestic giant in one way or another. He then moves to take a cursory look at the trap door, pulling it up.</p>

Perhaps this was a sign that his other tidings were fallacy as well. He reads on, thinking subconsciously of his father...master. He must research more...</p>

<p>Things race through Maouelue's mind, crowding in on his emotions and causing him to have to reread section. Finally, he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and thinks on his family.  Dysfunctional as it is, he has people to call 'family' now.  Bolstered by this newfound thought, he opens his eyes to start again...  and immediately finds something.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Beautiful.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is said to be an onyx black stone called chardalyn that is mined in and around the cold caves of Icewind Dale.  The gem was considered useless for a long time, until mages found it had magical properties.  A hand sized sample can go for over 20,000 gold, so the piece in front of Maouelue is probably worth 1,000 times that.  </p><p></p><p>Usually this material is brittle, but something has strengthened this sample.  More than likely to keep it's secrets intact.  The best way to go about finding out what spell is being stored in any shard of chardalyn (for that is what they're known for) would be Detect Magic.  Barring that, Identify would be another good route.  If one would rather destroy the piece, overloading it with magic should be considered.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of magic on the giant chardalyn shard.  First is an abjuration spell focusing on shielding.  The second, deeper seated one is a teleportation spell.  The gem exudes the abjuration, but the other is more internal.</p><p>(Gonna pause there for tonight.  Great game, sir, as always!!)</p>

Astonishingly beautiful, curvaceous, and, again, wearing just the barest of gossamer gowns, she is stunning.  As she looks up at him, however, the eyes betray her.  Bloodshot and a sickly bright green, the image flickers for a second and Maouelue can see the horror within.  A grotesque, hunchbacked woman with only one eye, boils all over her body, and a gangrenous green tint to all of her mottled black-blue skin, the hag is a nightmare incarnate.   As quick as the vision comes, though, it vanishes and again Maouelue is staring at a beautiful stranger.   </p><p></p><p>"Queen Mab is...  away on...  let's say <i>business</i>.  Would you like me to call for her?  If she recognizes the name, she could indeed return quickly!"  She takes a step closer to the Dragon Mage.

<p>(actually never mind)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue slumps into the remotest corner of the room far away from the doors after tidying up the chests as best he can. He holds the potion of invisibility at the ready and harries himself in to the most functional of reveries. He meditates on all he has been told and all he has read of Mag Tureah. His mind palace's walkways merge with the dark corridors of the keep...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can retcon the potions if you want.  You thinking short/long rest?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue thinks on Mag Tureah, and remembers almost immediately that it is a Fomorian stronghold, with ogres and goblins and unseelie en masse.  A twinge hits him that...  where he is now...  is not Mag Tureah.  It is the Fortress of the Queen of Air and Darkness, her secret, hidden keep.  There should be another crystal here, one that should get him back to the Pale Prince's keep.  The sounds of fighting must be the Summer Court's forces... but that would mean either a good amount of time has passed (which is highly likely) or that the Summer Court possibly changed their strategy.  Or it might be a civil insurrection, too...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was thinking I'd take the potions just in case I got discovered and had to fight, but yeah, trying to rest here. For some reason thought Mag and Queen's fortress were the same.)</p>

<p>Ever since Maouelue touched the chardalyn shard, he's been feeling strange - as if he can feel the presence of the crystals around him.  A possible side effect?  He's not quite sure, but he does sense the presence of a <i>very</i> large shard somewhere to the NW of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And it is fairly close.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns on the spot and, as if on a tractor beam, gets sucked right in towards the source of magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He sniffs for it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue moves to the W door, almost as if under a spell.  While facing the door, he can feel it - <i>smell</i> it - to his right, and a little in front...  directly NNW.  And it seems to be pulsing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Now he leans in. He listens to its rhythm</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVN3gNxvIIk

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a steady pulse, one that brings Maouelue back to his roots...  and then it starts to strike an ominous tone.  Perhaps it's the atmosphere, maybe it's the essence of the chardalyn itself, but as Maouelue listens to the inherent beat of the crystal's call, he starts getting very worried.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue creates a gentle rain to drizzle down upon the hurting shard and blesses it as the water falls softly, slowly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I can't, man!!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Is it a trick of the light, or does he see a tiny Bellatrix inside the crystal, twirling, dancing?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!  And - has he gone through the door?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sorry, yeah he can go through the door before blessing the rain)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens on a hallway to the right and Maouelue immediately sees the massive chardalyn structure.  It appears to be growing out of the rough stone of the keep, branching several directions as a multitude of individual spires erupt from the central core of the boulder-sized hub.  He peers into the gem and can see Bellatrix dancing, Benna cackling, and...  a strange figure creeping in from the left side of the crystal shard.  He can't see quite yet, but it stands to reason that the room opens up fairly wide to accommodate the many devotees who would honor the shard.  The snarls of some nasty, slavering beast get closer, coming from the W side of the room...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The time comes for all of us to face our demons in the end." He says as he pursues the slavering sounds.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Stealthy or no?  If so, stealth check, please!  If not, let me know how you're entering the room.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Maouelue clambers through the hallway towards the slobbering sounds.  A loud clanging starts up in the W just as the metal mage peeks into the room.  The crystal takes up the center portion, but there are tables and chairs lining the room, as if it were a ceremonial destination.  Maouelue can see there is an exit to the W, being blocked by a distracted...  dog?  No other egress can be seen.  There is an angled stone wall behind him, and all around the room are stone walls with bas-reliefs depicting the Queen of Air and Light in all her victorious glory.</p>

Fine rugs and tapestries can be seen on the wall, illuminated by several ornate wall sconces.  A <i>scritch...  scritch</i>  can be heard from that room.</p>

<p>The armor clunks heavily as Maouelue pounds through the room, trying to find restoratives for his companions and other goodies.  Hundreds of pieces of ammunition (standard) lie about - arrows, bolts, and marble-sized ball bearings used in slings.  There is one healer's kit, a box of bandages and gauze with some ointment in a glass vial, and two standard potions of healing.  </p><p></p><p>Bellatrix notices another box of healer supplies and makes quick work of bandaging her sister.  Benna is stable, the blood has been staunched (for now), and Bellatrix rises and looks to Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>Unnoticed, until now, is a small, cloaked man - a young man, no more than 17 years old, elfin, hood down to show his close cropped blonde hair and surprised expression - looks upon the unfolding chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>"Wh...  wh....    who are you?  Hhhh..  Hh..  How did you gg..  get in hh..  here?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns to the elf, “Shhhhh.... young one, there are forces stirring here that you would do well to flee. But, pray, tell me, just where is <i>here</i>? For we have come by, erm, rather unconventional means.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He takes a deep breath, glad not to be thrown into a fight.  </p><p></p><p>Meekly, eyes darting between Maouelue and the women, he says, "'Tis the Fortress of the Queen of Air and Darkness, lord knight.  The fighting began some time ago, and she has fled.  She bade me stay here and keep watch, and scribe the events of the battle.  I have been doing what I can, with her scrying beacons around the keep.  We are many leagues underground, I cannot understand how the Court's forces were able to find us here.  Have you come to stem the tide?  To push the enemy back, brave knight?"  He looks up, wide eyed and innocently pleading.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I am the Queen’s chosen and yes, young one, I have indeed come to stem the tide and lay low the enemy. The Queen’s teleportation magic is...a bit erratic at times, so I thank you for your service in our reorientation. So that I can complete the Queen’s mission, can you recount for me, quickly, what has transpired here this far?”</p>

<p>"Thank the gods!  The Queen's Chosen!!"  He fiddles with an amulet around his neck and cautiously moves further into the room.  </p><p></p><p>"It all started...  let's see....  about four days ago.  Large battalions of troops from the Summer Court materialized at our gates.  It's impossible to teleport into the keep itself unless given the magic directly from the Queen, so we knew there was no threat inside, however these eladrin invaders started picking through our defenses quickly.  Soon, most of the Fomorian guards and the mage range fighters were repealing back into the keep, some even went to the transport room and fled away completely.  The Queen took a contingent of her guard and touched the chardalyn, teleporting I know not where.  I've been secured in here by the arcane door, listening for more breaches of the castle walls and viewing the battle from afar.  It seems a stalemate at the moment, actually.  The outer walls have been broken through, but our inner sanctum is still intact.  I have seen others escaping via the aqueducts as well - dirty pirates and brigands, the lot of them.  She should have never brought their kind on...  Oh...  my apologies, Chosen.  I did not mean to speak ill of our Queen."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You would do well not to, young one...,” he gives the whelp a simmering look from under his visor as he lets this absorb in the silence. “As it so happens, I am here because of that very...treachery. I come from the throne room in the Fortress of Frozen Tears, if you take my meaning. I am bidden to come and clean up the...” he looks about the room, “mess that’s been created here.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Your time has come. Lead on, young one. Take me to the Queen.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Real quick ret-con question, should I retain the spell slots for blessing the rain or did that actually go down and have any effect?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The young mage looks abashed, then says, "I'm sorry, saer knight.  I can only lead you to the arcane door.  The knowledge to move past I do not have."  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue is shown doorway with a shimmery opaqueness that has taken the place of a physical door.</p>

<p>"You have my thanks, young one. Your duty now is to make haste away from here." He hands him a platinum coin. "Here is for your troubles. Arm yourself with what you can and now make haste away!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks wide eyed at Maouelue, nodding off-handedly.  Making his way back to his chair and desk on the northern wall of the W room, he starts back up writing, with a <i>scritch, scritch, scritch...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>What part of AWAY didn’t you understand, young one?!!</i>” Maouelue takes a few intimidating steps toward the youth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wh...Whh..  Where am I to go?!  I cannot get through the barrier?"</p><p>(There are no other exits, just the arcane door on the S wall of the W room.  Roll20 is up to date.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“One point of egress...naturally. Well, hide yourself as best you can, and <i>give me those papers for the Queen!</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>"Th...  th..  thank you, saer knight..."  He backs away from Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He steps to the shimmering door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue bounces back from the door.  His hands come up and press against the shimmering.  The hands stop as if a real door were there.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Metal Mage considers the door a moment and looks to Bellatrix, concealing his questioning look from the young elf.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He whispers, "What do you know of portals such as these?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Not much.  They usually either have a word to open them, or they're attuned to  specific person."  (Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix's words hint on something Maouelue remembers from his studies.  These locks need a password, or to be attuned, or they can be dispelled by a spell.  It would have to match the level the lock was set at, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>The Dragon Mage lifts the shield in the air and activates it.  He moves toward the door, holding the shield at the ready.  As the shimmer touches the shield, it parts, blocking off the spell's energy and creating a barrier around the shield itself.  (As if it were dispelling with a 10 ft sphere around the shield.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Stepping through the door, the trio enters a long hall with statues lining the wall.  Right in front of them is a massive statue of a screaming dragon.  The ones on the wall are made of etched stone, but the dragon is highly glossed, polished marble.  Immediately to the left of them is an animal very familiar to Maouelue...  the man-faced dog is quirking it's head to the newly arrived group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hoy Man-Dog....” he looks at the ground around... “Shit.”</p>

<p>"Whomever could you be, elegant dragon? What deeds have earned you this place of reverence?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Looking over the room, the statues are of various elves, all in a state of battle or reverence.  Most are fully armored, almost every one has a beautifully crafted weapon of some kind barred or in use.</p><p></p><p>The dragon statue is very similar.  Very lifelike.  This section has been enlarged from the others, to accommodate this statue and some of the others, which tower several feet over Maouelue's head.  The dragon is 20ft tall itself.  </p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage touches the marble statue, and a slight hum can be felt.</p>

<p>The smell of smoke and fire overtake Maouelue's senses.  An acrid, acidic taste hits the back of his throat, and he gags, inhaling even more of the phantom remnants of imagined flames.  His body temperature rises instantly and Maouelue is overcome with heat, causing his armor to heat as well, burning to the touch.  A powerful voice overtakes his mind, adding to the pain and chaos of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"<i>You</i> are not the Queen.  Where is she?  When will my torment end?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do I recognize the voice or have any intuition?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue feels that this voice, if it were embodied, would like to do harm to everything and everyone.  Then his mind flashes back to the wizard trapped in the dungeon.  And the shadow dragon shut up there as well.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He staggers back, reeling and attempting to maintain his balance in light of the horror. He should be more careful with his communion henceforth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voice stays with Maouelue, the feel of the flames, the false smoke he inhales with every breath.  </p><p></p><p>"I asked, <i>WHO</i> are <i>YOU</i>?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I am Lumao. And I am here for your Queen.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Hmmph.  She's not my Queen, Lumao.  She, along with a <i>very</i> long list of offenders, have trapped me in this hell...  this...  limbo.  One which, even with all of my considerable powers, I cannot undo.  Find a way to destroy this cage I am in, Lumao, and I will grant you treasure and power beyond your every desire."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I already have a dragon patron, one of pure radiant life, light that would scour your darkness from this realm. No, I think you are here for good reason."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The growl resounds around the mages brain...  </p><p>(Constitution saving throw, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ringing abates slightly, but does not go away.  The growl turns into a roar, and at the pinicle, the dragon says, "Today I add Lumao on my list of enemies to <i>vanquish</i> upon my GLORIOUS return!"  </p><p></p><p>And with that, he fades from Lumao's mind.   The marble phases out to the group's eyes, almost as if a blur spell had been cast on it.  As quickly as it comes, it goes.  Bellatrix, Benna, and the Man-Faced-Dog(tm) all look at the mage curiously.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Shaken, he turns to the others. “Let’s move.” He offers nothing else.</p>
