<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Bella, Benna, this seems like your area of expertise. What do you make of this glowing toadstool?"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

**Result**: 1d20 (3)
**Total**: 3

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look but come up confused.  "These...  are not known to us.  They must be only found in the Feywild.  Did you want us to investigate them further?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Yes, let's do. I will inspect it for magical properties."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sets about exploring the mushroom in more detail, trying to sense what magic might be emanating from it. He takes a few  spore samples as he does and stows them for later investigation as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>For the purple one...</i>  (Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can't really tell what it is, or what it does, but he gets a sense that it might be hostile if he tries to harm it in any way.  (Con save to get near the yellow ones, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard can get closer enough to a group of yellow fungi without harmful effects of the airborne spores.  That being said, they're still pretty strange looking.  Maouelue doesn't get the sense that they're magical, though.  They might have some interesting properties, but further examination would need to be done.  (An alchemist would have proficiency on investigation checks for this, fyi.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue gets closer into the area, he sees that getting past these mushrooms without touching them might be a tricky business.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"On second thought...let me take a slightly different vantage on these...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves back and directs his familiar to harvest some of the species and return them to a  piece of parchment he lays out for the purpose.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Survival check from Mao for what the bird is able to procure, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard familiar is able to get a good quantity of yellow mushroom.  And, for good measure, was able to take a chunk out of the purple one, too.  Just as it flew in and out for the last time, a spore cloud caught it and he flew straight through.  (Con save, please!)</p>

He's alright, just flustered a bit.  Now that the bits are set aside, Benna pulls out some equipment from her vest pockets and studies the mushrooms.  The yellow one is: Dwarven Fart. This mushroom is the size of a fist and packed full of spores. Crushing it or throwing it will cause it to release a cloud of spores in an area the size of a 5ft radius sphere. Each creature inside must pass a DC 15 check or be poisoned by an hour.  The purple one is: Gripa. Sometimes known as the sign of tragedy, or the plant of deaths. Rumor has it gripa grows where tragedies have taken place, as a memory of the fallen and their miseries. This purple vine grows as a product of the decomposition of a humanoid. It is often used by hags, which makes them really prone to build settlements around areas rich in gripa. It is rare to find, and with a large enough amount, it can be used as a daily treatment to reduce aging and it’s symptoms. It can also be used for purple coloring.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(need to pause. yay shrooms! lol. Tty tomorrow!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Shrooms!  Have a good night, sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ok, well...now I’ve got these mushrooms...  Now...Where the <i>hell</i> are we?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just past the mushroom cavern, the group sees carved stone walls with a hall moving off to the left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“In for another shroom, in for another room I always say... Let’s head on!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They move to the hall....on the left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the quartet moves through the mushroom minefield, they enter the carved room structure, looking as if it were either constructed by someone or something, or possibly transposed into this mountain somehow.  The hall, beautifully carved stone throughout, carries on for about 25 feet then opens into another small room.  Halfway down the hall is another offshoot to the right (leading W).</p><p>(Roll20 is updated, btw.)</p>
