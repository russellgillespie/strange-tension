<div class="character-1"><p>The giant flesh golem/human scorpion attacks!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Target frume not found.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"AH, HOLY SHIT THAT HURTS!!" yells Frume as a stinger pierces his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go get her....er....it...Shelli!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli slimes over and matches tentacle for abominable arm with the decrepit, soulless pile of limbs.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>p</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume throws his dagger, missing the creature badly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shakes his head, then takes a short running lead.  He jumps on Shelli's shell, and stabs down at the monster!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sword slices through a few appendages.  They flop to the ground, twitching with retained electrical impulses.  Frume lands on the opposite side of the creature, laughing.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The monstrosity, on it's last legs... er...  appendages grabs an eyestalk of Shelli's and <i>rips</i> it out.  The snail lets out a small shriek, dark ichor spraying the creature and the ground around them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You bitch!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You ok Shelli? Look what that friend did to you!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume picks up his dagger from the ground.  "Okay, Dieter, we have bad news, and worse news.  Which one do ya want first?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The less time we waste the better, leave the rhetorics to the romantics.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter reclaims his boomerang as he tends to Shelli’s wounds.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Okay, well...  that explosion's going to be bringing the cavalry.  Second, just beyond that door is a black dragon.  We can either go in guns blazing, try this room here (he points to the now broken door on the W wall), or we maybe try to get back to the catacombs, try our luck there.  Either way, doesn't look...  the greatest."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“By the grace of the grotto! A black dragon!?!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I mean...they’d be mad to follow us....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Was he chained?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Mighta been.  Didn't look <i>that</i> closely.  I was more concentrating on the fact that it was eating something."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Something with bones..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, how about this, we open that door to the Dragon and hide off this side chamber and await to ambush should they be so daft as to charge down the dragon. I’ll use my ring to remain hidden while I open the door.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sheila, get ready to mass stun!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shrugs. "Sounds like a good a plan as any.  I'll jump into this side room here.  We'll see what happens, eh?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume heads into the side room.  "What. In. The.  Shit."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is very distracted by either Frume, or Shelli, or the remaining fire from the other room, or the black dragon...  Lots on his mind at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What now Frume?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter enters the side room, another strange sight greets him.  For no apparent reason, there is a goblin tent set up in here.  A small, greasy fire is burnt into the stone floor.  Three barrels of foul smelling liquid are seeping through broken slats in the corner, dampening the floor.  Inside the tent, three dead goblins can be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume just stares at Dieter, as if to say, 'What the hell is this?'</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Not sparing a moment, Dieter says, “Help me with these Barrels!” He has Frume help him move the barrels into their growing booby trap in front of the dragon door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two move the barrels pretty quickly to block the double doors.  The three just barely stretch across their length, but it looks like it should hold if anyone were to try to open them.  Unless they open outwards from this room...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to determine what is in the barrels. “Back up Frume”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume backs up.  Dieter prepares, but just as he's about to make a move, the double doors start opening towards the heroes...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter taps his ring, instinctively going invisible.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume flops into the other room.  The snail stays put.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gets busy uncorking a barrel and seeing whether he can tip it over in time.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doors swing wide open, banging against the stone walls.  A regal man steps in.  Coarse, curly black hair sits atop a stern looking, young man's face.  Even though he is young, his face is battle-scarred; a long, thin wound, partially healed, carved his face from left temple to right jaw.   He's covered in plate mail that looked hale but battered.</p></div>
