<div class="character-0"><p>"While you eat, friend, we will sit down the hall while the smoke clears, sorry about that by the way, and recover our strength. We'll need it for what comes next..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>[short rest/(Feywild LR)]</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Snarr offers for you to come into the vast room and eat with him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed, we will join you! Come Bella, come Benna!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he sees the women, he says, "OOOH, PRETTIES!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He waves with his good hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Alright, alright, keep your hand to yourself!" He smirks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks abashed and sits on his hand.  Bellatrix smiles at him, though, and that brightens him up.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok then Snarr, it looks like we’re about ready then. I just need to know one thing. Do you want to do the honors or me?” He pulls out the Mace of Reduction and proffers it. “All it will take is one <i>good</i> strike, and we should be in business.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"MAYBE WE CAN TAKE TURNS?  WHAT AM I HITTING?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well you see here Snarr, the thing is, this mace right here...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gestures again with the mace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...will cast a reduction spell on you if we get it <i>just</i> right.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“May I?...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ahh...not quite...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Eeesh, sorry about that. Maybe if you hold still I can get lined up just right...”</p><p>[adv?]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here let me ease this for you a bit.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There, does that help?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"YEP!  THANKS!"  He scratches his head with his stump.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The giant, in a sudden spasm, shrinks down to half his size, stunning the ladies who didn't know you could do that!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Snarr, surprised by seeing the small people get large, takes a few moments to re-orient himself.  </p><p>"Hmmm."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a time, he notices the door is significantly more...  available to proceed through, and smiles at Maouelue.</p><p>(Crits on a 19+)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Y’alright there sNARR? Here, take this.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That ought to help a little anyway. Now follow us!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He follows, mesmerized at finally leaving his prison.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’d say, ‘Smell the fresh air,’ but....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads the brief way down the hall and shows the seal to sNARR. “I think the answer to your questions lies here, friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I know not what will happen, but if we don’t see each other again, I wish you the best in  your search. Let the name Lumao “Maouelue” Albrek be known as a friend to the Giants.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With wide eyes, he enters the treasure room, gazing at the wondrous wealth and shiny things.  Then his gaze lands on the 'coin' on the wall, and his mouth falls open even farther.  As he moves towards the object, there is a low humming that starts.  Everyone looks around, but as Snarr gets closer to the 'coin', the humming quite obviously gets louder and louder.  As he reaches for it, puts his hands on it, the humming turns into a heartbeat, the now very loud <i>thrumm thrumm</i> echoing around the room and seemingly throughout the underground complex.  </p><p></p><p>Snarr's hands move around some of the runes, then he finds the dragon mark.  As his hand touches it, like molten gold melting away, the patina of the 'coin' falls away and a blast furnace of heat greets the adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s blue orbs shrivel a little.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“If I may....before you go...what is this place?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A long time ago, Zalto, the guy up there, split the fire giant ordning so's we couldn't come back to our home in the elemental plane of fire.  We'd been kicked out so long...  I'm not even sure there are any more of my kind over there.  But, anything is better than being here.  Thank you, Maouelue, friend o'the giants.  I will tell others of your great deeds."  He bows low to Maouelue and the women, then steps through the gate and, in reverse, the molten gold flows back up to re-seal the 'coin'.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The group lingers in the silence, in the space that for the first time in who knows how long, was no longer a prison. They move into the room vacated by Snarr gathering in their surroundings. Maouelue asks Benna to provide some light.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is the biggest space the group has seen so far.  Cracks in the floor reveal where the methane gas has been coming from.  Just below the floor seems to be a lava run, which had been eroding various minerals.</p></div>
