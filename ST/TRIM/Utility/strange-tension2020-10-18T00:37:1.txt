strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>(Crazy night, just getting back in from yard work, etc!)</p><p>As the group stares at the ring, flames dance along it's mirrored surface.  The flames change to ghastly faces, to glyphs, to writing, to faces again...  The three shake their heads, as if trying to rid themselves of the visions.  The wizard, for just a moment, seizes on something from the long distant past.  A tale of old forgotten lore regarding a lost ring of invisibility and...  was it fire?  Eons ago, there was a story about a lost ring...  But as soon as it comes, the memory goes.  </p><p></p><p>Briffo takes the ring back, almost conspiratorially.   He shakes off some of the dust, puts the ring back on, then leads the group northward through the NE door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Towering bookcases line the walls and stretch across this room, but there are only a few books left on them.  A lounging area is furnished for comfort, though the leather looks aged.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are six main bookshelves, all marked with sigils.  Two couches and a few side tables are arranged for relaxed study.  There are several candelabra here, a couple still have hale candles in them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They inspect the sigil labels and compare notes, then begin to look amongst the books.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Some of the sigils are familiar, a couple Maouelue doesn't know.  (D30 for number of books.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a contemporary interesting book entitled 'Physiologies of Magical Creatures' - Information on the biology of Beholders, Dragons, Unicorns, and more. Full of diagrams. This book is a little more eye-catching than most other mundane books.</p><p></p><p>This book is in mint condition. It is written in Common Speech. It has a lengthy foreword or dedication to someone.</p><p></p><p>This book is worth 50 gps and has 145 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a old skill book entitled Unearthed Theories on Knowledge. This book is meant to increase a wizards intelligence. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Common Speech. It is obviously not written in the author's mother tongue.</p><p>This book is worth 65 gps and has 214 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a recently written skill book entitled Unambiguous Conceptions on Intimidation. This book is meant to teach intimidation techniques. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Common Speech. It has a haughty and authoratative tone.</p><p>This book is worth 40 gps and has 505 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a contemporary biography entitled Exposed Triumphs of the Guild.</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Magical Writing (Requires Magical Deciphering). It looks to be a part of a series of volumes.</p><p>This book is worth 10 gps and has 543 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a bandolier hanging on the bookshelf by a door to the W.  There is a hallway on the E wall, on it's south end.  There is another door on it's north end.  This one looks stained with something...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks over to inspect the bandolier.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He compares it to the poison one he carries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a very nicely made leather bandolier, this one carries parchment.  Scroll cases and buckles adorn the carrier.  Oddly, it looks almost new.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls it down and puts it on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a good fit!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They move east through the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group goes through the hallway.  More wear and tear can be seen through here.  Tapestries are moth eaten or completely ripped down.  The hallway widens to a small entry room.  A door to the N and a door to the E.  The door to the N looks stained with something.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue nods to the group and they head over to the stained door to inspect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's mildew.  It doesn't seem damp on this side of the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pushes on the door and tries to open it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's hard to push initially.  All three of the group give it a go, and with a scraping, the door eases inward.  A short hallway opens into what looks like a green room.  Literally, the entire room is green with mildew and lichen, decay and rot and filth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a large bowl in the center of the room, also covered in green mold.  (This whole floor works as difficult terrain, which means your speed per round is halved.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you ease in further to the room you see six symmetrical doors.  One on the W and E walls, two on the N and S walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue extends a ghostly hand out into the middle of the room to try  and pick up the bowl to retrieve it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bowl is larger than the hand, and is covered in a slippery green slime...  (Strength check with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage hand lifts the bowl and brings it to the wizard.</p></div>
