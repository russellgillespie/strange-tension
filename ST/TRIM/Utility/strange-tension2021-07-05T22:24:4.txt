strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The stairs open into a library of sorts.  The last one you were in was...  scary and had a carcass in it.  This one in <i>much</i> homier, with a couple nicely upholstered chairs, a few bookshelves, and a very large chest against the far wall.  There are doors on the N, E, and S walls, all wooden and fairly simple.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter moves about the room, looking for any traps and magical traces.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are several magic things in the room, small explosions greet the druid as he casts the spell.  The chest is one, abjuration and evocation magic are attached.  A few books pop out at Dieter ranging from illusion to necromancy, and underneath the rug, a small ping of divination magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter raises a finger. “Move carefully in here… matter of fact, don’t move at all…”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He kneels to sense at the magics beneath the rug first, sensing a trap.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He lifts the rug, and...  sees a ring.  Silver, with small engravings of moons and stars on the sides, curving all around it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, what a curious object!” He runs his fingers over the runes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ring is cold to the touch, colder than the room or stones around it.  The inscription is less runic than astrological and aesthetic.  It has a heft to it as well.  (Arcana or identify spell for more info.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It feels like this ring will give you the possibility of casting a school of divinity spell.  Which one, you can't quite tell.  But there's some serious potential in this ring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Jaecob, remind me prepare some identification magic next time we reset up. I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot of this kind of thing going forward."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Now picking up and stowing the ring, the dogged druid moves now toward the chest, now even warier with the pings of evocation around it. He steadies his hand and checks for any trapped mechanisms on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is no physical lock, but it looks like there is an arcane lock on it.  A knock spell, dispell magic spell, or high arcana check will be able to break through it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm," shrugs Dieter. "I am not prepared. I'll just have to see what I can make of this."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter probes, searching.  There is an aura of abjuration magic, protection magic.  It reminds him of Maouelue for a moment.  He recalls the mage's capability with magics, how adept he always was with all things magical.  As he probes, he wonders where his friend was at that moment.  A <i>click</i> brings him back from his reverie.  The large, ornate clasp on the front of the long chest flips open, the aura fades.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well fancy that..." <i>Was it just coincidence? Just as he was thinking of the arcane elf....</i> "Humphf...surely just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>He leans in now with thirsty intent on the contents.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's also 4,000 gold in rare gems.  Dieter sees four beautifully cut gems, various colors.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter turns now to the books. If he's being honest he was a bit tired of reading at that very moment, but he could not resist the pull of magic emanating from the various tomes. Securing the chest's contents, he now moves among the volumes, pulling the glowing books from their shelving, reading.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter picks through the volumes, most have a good solid layer of dust on them. he finds two that seems very well-worn but still quite well put together. At a quick glance, there's a broad book that tells of various evocation spells, and how to put them together properly (Reading the book will gain you one level 2 spell from the Evocation school).  The next book is black, with no markings on it.  The inside is blank.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What a strange tome this is..." Dieter remarks, turning it's pages over in his hands and showing it to his entourage. "What do you lot make of it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob shrugs and falls into a chair, yawning widely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well, I'm sure we can prod it for answers along the way." He says, stowing it in his pack and beginning to read the first book with eagerness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter now scans the rest of the room and begins moving to the doors in clockwise order starting at the West, turning their knobs and looking beyond into each space.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves then to the N door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just beyond, a storeroom with various sundry items.  Dried beans and fruit.  Some cured meats.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Before Dieter went into the N room, however, he did have to unlock the door.  It was locked from his side.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come get your fill lads."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob bounds from the chair.  "Aye, lad!!"</p></div>
