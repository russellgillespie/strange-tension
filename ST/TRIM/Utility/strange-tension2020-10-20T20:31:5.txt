The specific runes in the rooms and on the parchment don't really have a correlation to anything.  You're getting the feeling that the 'runemark' password was a trap.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The door...  opens majestically.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As it pushes inward, you see a cozily lit study, of sorts.  Bookshelves line the walls, the books covered in heavy leather and looking very old.  There is a massive bear-skin rug on the floor, a considerable trophy of skill and strength.  There are numerous chests in this room as well.  The entire room is lit by what looks to be ever-lasting candles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter bristles at the bear display.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue admires the candles, then pulls out the wand of secrets and releases one of its charges, searching for traps or hidden doors.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the bookshelves.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wand of secrets pings, points to a corner where a beautiful set of plate armor stands upright.  There is a base where the armor stand could be moved toward the door of the room.  The plate is a burnished steel, but it looks to have oxidized a bit, giving it an interesting black-green sheen to it.  The metal is dull and does not reflect any of the light shining on it. </p><p></p><p>The books smell musty but not in a damp sort of way.  They must have been here for centuries, you figure.  (History check for more!)  Maouelue takes down a book or two, inspects them.  They are in a language that is almost impossible to read... as the word never stop moving on the page.  Line after line, picture after picture, the books are a maze of movement.  Diagrams drip between pages, margins are attacked and seized.  There are many books like this.  Although, as Maouelue searches, he does find a few that are able to be read... by a wizard.  (d6 roll, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't seem to grasp something in the back of his mind about books with moving words.  He could swear he's heard about this phenomena before, though.</p><p>Dieter doesn't catch it either, but for some reason, he's making a connection to a previous book they confiscated concerning the Anauroch Desert.  He can't get more precise that than.</p><p>Maouelue finds two readable books.  </p><p></p><p>This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Common Speech.

<div class="character-1"><p><i>'The Tao of Earth' - Starts with philosophical musings about the importance of creation and stability over destruction and change. This book is written in an old dialect that most people (even magic users) have trouble reading. It occasionally goes on long-winded philosophical tangents.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are a couple interesting items that catch your eyes as well...</p><p>As the wizard searches books, his eye catches on a jar full of wildly colored mushrooms.  They seem to give off a dull red aura as well.  You've never even heard of such a thing!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just before Dieter checks the armor, he spies a knotty staff, more a long branch than an actual staff, that has some green leaves sprouting from the top.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The majority of the chests are full to the brim of the 'runemark' coins.   These are gold, however.  There is something strange about them... (Investigation check).</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue tries looking through the bins, sifting through the coins.  The connection to what's off isn't hitting the wizard, but he knows something is off.  Something strange about the feel of the coins.  The weight...</p></div>
