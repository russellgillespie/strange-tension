However, once you choose it, I promise you it will not be without glorious rewards.  Find the other two statues, learn what I have to give you.  Once this is complete, find the iron door.  Use this key to start your new lives under a new banner.  May the Great Scaled One rise and live forever! -LM</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard pockets the key and mutters...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So. Close. Now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group heads back to the rope, but considers the passageways underneath the route above for a moment. It had all happened so fast, first the ceiling, then the boosting and teleporting up. Had they missed something below?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard is fairly confident that, although these caves are probably vast and they would be able to search a very long time and find many interesting things, things pertaining to their current quarry are above, not below.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's at times like these that Dieter is glad he brings a cool head along.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group attempts to ascend the rope.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They assist the one-handed Frume up, then Dieter helps with the metal mage's ascent, then he attempts to clamber up afterward.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something seems different in this room to you all... (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stench of acid is still strong here but the clothes are in the wrong place.  Maouelue remembers going through them, as does Dieter.  They both agree that someone else has been through them recently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter goes invisible again and moves out toward the front of the group. They start back around to where they stoned the basilisks and inspect the far end of the room.</i> (r20)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hallway before the group is narrow and the torchlight flickers off it menacingly.  The ceiling is ridged like the gullet of a snake.  (Perception check)</p><p></p><p>There are multiple passageways off of the hallway.  The room to the right has discarded and rotten tapestries moldering way on the floor.  Two open rooms are on the left side of the wall.  At the end of the hall, two snake-men statues stand guard over a vestibule area and a hallway that travels NE.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This hallway is trapped, something about those ridges.  Dieter can't say exactly, but those ridges don't look safe.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard looks in and nods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid inspects the area for any triggers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They peer into the space on the left before the triggers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first room on the left has rotted pillows on the floor surrounding three large stone eggs.  Tapestries that might have hung on the walls are in tatters on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes special interest in the eggs, feeling them over with his ungloved hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue taps into the arcane, sensing magic within the eggs.  They are made of rough stone, but carved well without any cracks or pockmarks on the surface.  There does seem to be a thin red, sticky coating on the tops of all three.  Maouelue smells the substance.  Blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is getting a bit weary of fanatical burning at this point, but he’s to tired to bother arguing. He sets a small flame at the base of the eggs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing happens as it's lit on fire.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, nonplussed, leads the group back out the door and around to find another way across the trapped room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Besides jumping over the trapped floor, there is the diagonal hallway to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take the diagonal hall back into the 4-way room and look to go through the manacle room. They also want to slice all the manacles down if possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group travels down the length of hallway, with Maouelue and Dieter's passive perception, they catch sight of an irregularity in the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They check it out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a mesh covering cleverly disguised as a false floor.  It covers a pit filled with spikes.  Bones litter the floor below.  The pit is five feet across.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oi that’s a bit of a jump!”, the Druid remarks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Nice one metal man!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is in all honesty a bit appalled by the sheer amount of alloy accompanying his accomplice of late</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume and Dieter hop over, while Maouelue checks the trajectory.  He hops, but not quite far enough.  His metal boots slip on the very edge of the pit, causing him to slip backward...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a deft hand (and an <i>only</i> hand), Frume reaches out to steady the Dragon Mage, ushering him to safety. </p><p></p><p>The group continues around the path, eventually making their way past the manacles and into the hall where they could go out to the crevasse, or to the seemingly unnaturally dark room.</p></div>
