strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue assembles a plate with perhaps a bit less decorum than he might have wished, were he not <i>quite</i> so hungry. He is still agog with the wonder of this realm, regardless of the troubles it had already caused his party. He sits down on the left side of the King and Queen, offering Bellatrix a seat next to him at the table and calling for wine.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wine is poured by a lithe and sensual female summer eladrin that gives Maouelue a secret wink.  The smells of the food almost overwhelm him.  The wine is ruby hued, with flecks of gold fluttering within.  The food not only lifts the mages spirit, it gives him an undeniable feeling of hope and resurgence.  Akin to the feeling he had when first he came to the Feywild.  Daran and the others are similarly taken with the meal and the ambience.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a few moments of pure revelry in the tastes and smells, Queen Titania breaks the silence by saying, "I apologize for mixing business and pleasure.  I encourage you all to help yourselves to anything here, our table is yours.  However, we must speak on the events of the past day and look to the future.  Erifias and Otrinis have filled me in on the general events, to the best of their abilities.  Erifias is sleeping well, now.  Our best clerics administered them a great amount of healing.  They were nearly inconsolable, they thought their plan had doomed the two of you.  When Erifias awakes, it would do them well for you to be there, if you wish.  That being said, we must speak on our individual needs.  If it please you, I shall go first and let you continue to enjoy your repast?"  She blinks her large lavender eyes in Maouelue's direction, waiting for his permission.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks up with a leg of foul in his mouth, trying to nonchalantly out it back down on his plate and swallow quickly before he answers, “Of course, your Majesty.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The King chuckles and pops a quith-pa (the orb-like food) into his mouth.  The Queen smiles and continues, "We have been at war with the unseelie for quite some time.  My sister, who now calls herself the Queen of Air and Darkness, has been corrupted by a dark crystal.  In truth, if we could destroy the crystal, that would right everything, but I fear that is too lofty a goal for now.  She has raised an army, which has been attacking and killing our peoples all around the lands of the Feywild.  With her dire generals, she has made several strongholds, however most of them are in the Feydark.  I would not ask you to go into that abyss, for that would be requesting much more than any of us has to give.  However, there is one thing I believe you might be well suited for.  You have all proven yourselves tremendous fighters.  I believe if we were to eliminate a top ranking official of her command, we could stem the tide of the war, or shift it to our side.  I've been in talks with other realms regarding the creation of a force that might quell this uprising long-term.  Now, however, we need to strike deeply into her structure and make her realize we are not easy prey.  For this, along with our undying friendship, we offer you a boon.  Either of your request or of our choosing."  Her lavender eyes and golden skin ripple from the crystal reflection off of the table and plate-ware.  Her hair still wafts in the unseen breeze.</p></div>
