He lays eyes on his companion’s slumber. “Let him sleep,” he thinks to himself, then proceeds to inspect their new equipment and keep watch on the camp while awaiting the dawn. The sky is now a dark purple, the moon ringed by seven bright stars shines down on the Wizard. “Selene, watch over us.”Be our light in the darkness, be our shield from death. Be the one who stays our dying breath...”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair's slumber is calm, restorative.  There are strange visions occasionally flitting past, however.  Quick visions of a man with a moustache, of two serpentine sisters, of dark tunnels leading into the world; occasional frights to bitter the sweet memories of their friend's send off.  </p><p></p><p>The stars wink at Dieter.  Telling of arcane, unknowable secrets.  One of the stars goes out.  Comes back again.  The world then gets covered in darkness, but for only a second.  Whatever just passed over the moon must have been huge.  And either far away or silent.  Dieter keeps his vigil.  (Survival check from Dieter, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't make out what flew overhead.  Whatever it was, it sent a shiver down his spine.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Eventually the two come out of their slumber and reverie, refreshed and ready for the next leg of their journey.  (Where to?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter packs up his things and mounts his Clydesdale with one backward glance at the mausoleum. Maoulue follows suit, and in the morning light, the two trot back over to the smouldering remnants of Muhlen Manor. Their pace slows as they approach and inspect the grounds for safe passage back to the center of the ruin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tendrils of smoke rise from the smoldering remains of what once was Muhlen Manor.  Between the lightning and the internal fires, nothing remains but small bits of metal, a few crude blocks of stone, and ashes...  and a marble staircase leading to a box of stone, the runed vault doors barring entrance still.  There are many places where the fire even swept into the basement level, clearing out whatever was down there.  Earthen tunnels can be seen routing the earth below the main level, with entrance holes scattered hither and yon. </p><p></p><p>As the party approaches the scene, you both notice that getting across will be dangerous at best as there is no bridge or way to access the staircase directly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the distance to the staircase and looks for nearby sources of water.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are several puddles from the night prior.  Additionally, just over the next hill is a wonderful pond, just a bit algae-covered.  It's about 250 feet from the marble box.  (By the way, I say it's a box - it's actually a 40ft x 50ft by 20ft tall room.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gestures for the group to follow him. He leads them around to the pond and alternately uses magic to move water over to the smoldering wreckage then freeze it, crediting an icy bridge over to the staircase.</i></p><p><i>Dieter, catching on, begins to bring hands full of gravel and dirt over to ease the passage on the icy surface.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group smirks at their cheeky method of navigating the embers. It's almost</i> <b><i>too easy...</i></b></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They make their way towards the staircase, Maouelue lightly chuckling, but Dieter reeling himself in as he sees the dread doors again.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You approach the doors, everything seems solid, if a bit sooty.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue brushes some ash of his shoulder.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It smears.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue winces sheepishly at Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's eyes roll in exasperation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They approach the vault door and once again take a look at it to see how it fared during the blaze storm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It looks exactly like it did before, no marring, no soot.  You can see the sigils better now, in the light of day.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter does not hesitate. He traces the sigils in the order they have seen in their visions...the circle of runes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue reaches out and stays his hand....</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>I.  II.  III.  They were all different runes.  All of them are up here.  Maybe the last one on the parchment was a trick, too?  Could it be the fourth the ghost mentioned?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><q> "Hides. Fathers. Weath."</q></p><p><q> "Interloper. Now."</q></p><p><q> "Joined. Weath. Together."</q></p><p><q> "Clues. House. Four. Runes. Open."</q></p><p><q> "Be. Warned. Tragedy. Death. Cursed."</q></p><p>@SuoRess</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The runes are in Giant.  Maouelue is having a hard time placing the dialect or the area, but giant runes are naturally magical.</p></div>
