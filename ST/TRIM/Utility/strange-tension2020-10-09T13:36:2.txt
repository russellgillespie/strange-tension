But Maouelue detects the slightest hint of movement approximately 70 feet away.  Something humanoid is crouching down behind a tree staying perfectly still and blending into the foliage nearly seamlessly.  Nearly...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As Douglas runs towards the shack, he sees a shimmer of air through the doorway.  Bellatrix appears a bit further beyond where Douglas just came from and casts...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>And from the underbrush, thorny vines reach up 20 feet all around the escaping being.  It tries to make a jump over the rising vines, only to be thrust back into a circling hedge of bramble thickets.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>With all of the tumult around the being, it calms itself and looks around...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It ties a length of rope around an arrow and lets fly at the closest tree.  The arrow sticks, the humanoid scrambles up the length of rope. (It's now 10 feet above the thorn wall and 30 feet from the canopy of the trees.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Damn," swears Bellatrix.  She reaches into her component pouch, brings out a dried snakes skin and cast...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A green beam of light streaks toward the dangling thing, hitting it and swaying the cord.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Climbing 60 feet straight up, tongues of flame just beginning to lick at their boot heels, they pull themselves with extreme dexterity up to the higher branches of the tree.</p><p>(They are in 3/4 cover now, which means they get +5 to AC and Dex throws.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix screams in horror, running at the burning thicket...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flames have just started to catch in the underbrush, the once hale leaves in the trees around the thicket-wall searing and adding to the potential for this to become a problem. (The wall was 20ft in diameter, and it was mostly made of dead or dying branches, because of who cast it.  The floor of the forest is covered in moss, dead leaves, lichen, and the like.)</p></div>
