strange-tension*Finally lowering their amazed gazes back earthward, they saw a bit into the distance, a dark rippling reflection obscured by many overgrown hanging vines. There was something both ominous and alluring about the place...It* **called** *to them...

Dieter took one look at Flipper, who seemed uneasy in the presence of the dark dwelling in the distance. Dieter, however, pushed on, his form shifting into that of a fox, rooting through the thicket. Flipper reluctantly followed, himself turning into a large iguana, trying to keep apace with his furry friend.

After a few dogged minutes, they arrived at the edge of the vines, the area beyond still oddly dark and hard to see, but for the rippling reflection still drawing them in. Dieter nuzzled through the vine curtain with Flipper close on his tail. The air in here seemed immediately warmer and full of the acrid humidity of decay. Loamy particles reached their snuffling noses and they found themselves on the edge of a Greatswamp.

Dieter had heard of these, and apparently Flipper had too, because he immediately perked up at the sight of the great expanse of water stretching out into the dark jungle. He was MUCH more up for an adventure if he got to SWIM! The iguana boy dived headlong into the dark dank water and Dieter only had a moment to say, "Wait!" before his friend disappeared beneath the ripple in his wake. 

Suddenly, Dieter realized just how silent things had been previously, because the disturbance of Flippers ripple in the water seemed to echo eerily and loudly across the open expanse of water, bouncing back and fort against the trees encircling the space. All of a sudden, birds, insects, amphibians, and mammals alike began shrieking and stirring around the dark swamp. They seemed to be...moving away...

Dieter looked with horror as a darkness overtook the glowing ripple in the center of the swamp. Only now does Dieter see a single moonbeam had been pouring down through a single opening in the canopy...*
*How could he have missed that and....* **who** *could have made that kind of an opening here...
The darkness now began its own ripple and seemed to roil in the direction of where Flipper had descended!

Rooted to the spot, the next few moments lasted a lifetime...The darkness raced toward his friend and just then he saw the flurrying webbed feet of Flipper furiously flapping forward towards the shore, his eyes just catching the fox's whenâ€”*

*A **Giant Poisonous Snake** *shot up out of the swamp, flashing its wild tongue and mezmerizing green eyes down at the two terrified creatures!

Dieter turned and scurried away as fast as he could, taking desperate looks back for Flipper, but it was no use..

The snake dived down hard, crashing full force upon the helpless iguana...

Dieter's heart was beating out of his furry chest, but still found time to tear in half as he heard the last pitiful cry of the friend he had coaxed into coming...

The forlorn fox found his way back, somehow, to the edge of the forest, then lay down in the first bit of dunegrass he could find. He howled a weak chirping cry at the moon and passed out in shock there in the grass...

Later, just as the first rays of the rising sun were peeking over the horizon, a soft, but strong hand curled around a small, shivering boy, skin covered in lingering patches of red fur. Another hand, then arms curl and warm the pitiful form. The boy instinctually cuddles in close, and a tear falls down onto his forehead as he is carried to back to the enclave.*
*Depending on who is telling it and on what day and how many cups are in for that particular version, The Cryabore somewhere between dug his hand down into the earth and pulled, or cast a great spell slicing out a side of the mountain containing the great wyrm, then called down the icy winds from above and the plentiful waters of the nearby harbor and froze the beast solid as a statue, a grim reminder to any that might attempt to terrify these lands going forward.

Maouelue was* **fascinated** *by the great tales. He thirsted for history and would constantly devour tome after tome of draconic lineage and the unsung heroes of great battles. One day when was reading, he came across a curious passage about life and death in an old musty tome about power and devotion. It read, 

"She who holds the circled key,
yet deigns to turn and fear and flee,
meets only sorrow and decay,
and many losses on the way.

For had she gone the other way,
and chosen hope, began to pray,
possibilities would be,
 living ever presently."
*The passage struck a strange chord somewhere deep inside the young mage. He thought about the opportunities not taken because of his devotion to his studies. He thought about the frivolity that often got his peers into trouble, then he thought about the forbidden...

Sometimes when he would dream he would see a great wheel of fire and earth and water and wind, all spinning around each other, all eating and recreating each other. He would often ask Shi'V, as his closest friends would address him, about the places of great elemental imbalance like the ocean and the frosty mountains. He would inquire about Shi'V's famous victories and about how he channeled such great forces.

His master would often chuckle back, or smile, or sometimes not answer at all, but sometimes he would open up and give Lumaoue a bit of advice or encouragement, and on the very rare occasion, he would talk about a place deep in the ices of the upper mountains where he had found the word he needed to fully unlock his mastery of the element.

It was on this day ,as Lumaoue pored over the tome, that his mentor regarded him reading the very same passage that had once started his own journey of discovery into the balance of power...how to court the imbalance for the sake of power. If only he had had someone at that moment to guide him down the right path, maybe he could have saved years of searching! At that moment Shi'vandos put his hand on Lumaoue's shoulder and said,*
"Lumaoue Luebeid, I have had many students in my time, yet none have seemed to match their thirst for knowledge and power with the scientific integrity and righteous empathy that I have seen from you over these past five years. I see you reading this passage... You hold the circled key in your palm my pupil...my friend...my..."

*Lumaoue privately knew his master was about to say "son" but stopped short because of...well the accident was so many years ago, but some losses are not so easily forgotten.*

"...my son."

*Lumaoue slowly turned his gaze to meet Shi'V's gaze, the two locking eyes.*

"I need you to...find something for me..." 

"...some...one..."

"In the mountains...the ones I have sometimes spoken of...you must seek out Shi'veilan."

"Yes...."

"He lives."
