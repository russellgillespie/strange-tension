strange-tensionThe wizard treks around to the back, taking down his ostentatious manner...as much as possible. There’s something about this situation that intrigues him.


Maouelue makes his way to the rear of the building.  No one really marks his progress, but he does stand out.  A bit.

The birds are chirping, the sun is...  still setting.  Maouelue hiccups.
Squirrel.
He leans up against the wall. “This was a good idea. Yup. Good idea.”
Suddenly, the back door opens dramatically.  The sullen woman steps out and starts walking away, weeping quietly.
“Tinebrae...that is your name, is it not?”
The woman jumps, startled.  Crying has ceased for the moment as she gets her bearings.  After a few seconds, she says, in a soft voice, "Yes.  My name is Tinebrae.  Why are you back here?"
“I couldn’t help but note your interest in our party. Why do you flee?”
“There’s nothing to fear from me, I promise.” He holds his hands up in a show of peace. 🙌🏻

He rubs his hand on the back of his head and stutters.

Her eyes go a bit sharp and she takes a step backward, toward the main street.
"I had a row with a friend.  And that song made me...  uncomfortable.  That's all.  A bad memory from my childhood.  Thank you for worrying.  I'm feeling much better now."
“I’m sorry to pry. I shouldn’t...”
“Please excuse me.”
He turns to leave.
"Wait!" she yells!
He turns back.
She looks back and forth down the back alley.
"You're new to this city, yes?  And to the Feywilds as well?  There have been some very strange things happening lately, and I'm not sure if you're coming here is one or not.  Pardon my bluntness, but in my line of work, it's best to be open about what's at stake.  If you catch my meaning."  She looks down at her scuffed boots, shyly.
“Indeed. Go on.”
"The boat, the black ship the bard sang of?  It is docked at the wharf *right now*.  I've seen it.  It came in last night, late.  A few folk went to investigate, on a dare for the love of the gods...  but they never came back.  Some say the entire thing is empty, but it's huge.  Not a person has disembarked, either.  There's a legend that says 'first the ship comes back, then the god follows'.  And, frankly...  I'm scared to see what happens next."
“Dark tidings abound of late. Thank you for your words of caution. I may have cause to investigate ere long. Would it be forward of me to call on you at your establishment? Could you keep an eye on the activity around that ship?”
She seems surprised.  This woman is unused to someone looking out for the greater good, so she's cautious.  At the same time, she nods and says, "Yes.  I'll keep an eye.  And you can call on me at the Oaken Grove.  I'm usually there in the evenings."  She steps closer.  "Thank you, stranger."  She smiles, then runs off down the alley to the street.
He watches her on down the alley, considering her words, then turns and slowly starts off to rejoin with the others.
The carriage awaits at the end of the street, ready to ride.  Daran sits on the sidebar, smoking a pipe.  He waves when he sees you.  "Anything interesting?"
“In a minute...” He looks around a moment, then ushers into the carriage.
Daran hastily spills out his bowl and stows the pipe, hopping into the cab.  A snap and the horses move off.  Bellatrix smiles at Maouelue, then looks worried at his countenance.
As soon as the clatter from the ride creates ample noise, he starts in with the others about the black ship and his encounter with Tinebrae.
The old woman's eyes get large and she starts giggling, then cackling, then fully laughing outright, unnerving the others in the cart.  Bellatrix reaches out for her sister, "Honestly, Benna!  What's gotten into you?"

"Oh, the ghost ship a-comes!  The ghost ship a-comes!!  Hee hee!!"
Maouelue idly fondles a trio of platinum balls as he considers this, twirling them around in his left hand.
"Driver, please take us South out of the city. We aim for Lanrion's Tower."
"Padron me all, while I consider these tomes and scrolls. Feel free to pass them amongst yourselves along the way. We should steep ourselves in the lore of this place if we are to survive."
Maouelue begins by taking out the scrolls and copying them over to his spellbook excitedly. He would take some time to practice and prepare these when he could.

The carriage driver salutes behind to Maouelue, cracks the whip, and the horses jaunt off at a high trot.  Bellatrix still gives you an odd, worried look, but then gets interested in the books offered.  Daran and Benna also sift through them, checking out what they are all about.  The trip to the south of the city, to Lanrion's Tower, starts in earnest.
