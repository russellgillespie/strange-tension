The Dragon on the shield...the flying rider in the night...the black stone...could this be obsidian?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The platform seems solid under Stenchy's feet.  Dieter is putting things together, he's on a good track.  Maouelue is pretty close to the mystery of the coins...  If he and Dieter put their heads together... (Intelligence check for the two of them.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter speaks Giant.  Maouelue has a nagging feeling that there is a phrase or word in Giant that could solve this...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks over to the platform and says the word inscribed on the bottom of the chest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The word falls from Dieter's lips, the runes on the coins glow but the coins are unaffected other than that.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries a few more words in Giant.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>At dragon, the obsidian base shakes, and starts moving forward.  (Dex save for Stenchy!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter, still concentrating on the runes and coins, is caught off guard when the base moves.  (One more Dex save to catch yourself before you fall down a hole!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter falls backwards down the hole that is uncovered by the moving base.  He flails down, falling about 20 feet before clutching onto a rung of a ladder.  It stops his fall, but deals -</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nine points of damage, nearly wrenching his shoulder out of socket.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The rest of you, use the blasted ladder..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter calls his flames down after him and spreads them about.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hole is four by four, so it's about as big as a person.  Not too too much room to move around, but Dieter can light up the hole.  The ladder descends <i>far</i> into the earth.  The light shines about twenty feet down, just shows darkness beneath.  The druid throws the flame down.  It travels down, down, down...  Normally it would peter out 30 feet away, this one goes for a bit longer.   And it fades before hitting anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy drops one down and Dieter catches it, whispering "Runemark" to it before dropping it as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It lights up and falls...  falls... falls...  the light fades into the darkness.  No sound of the coin hitting anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's form begins to shrink, then disappear into the darkness...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, realizing too late he's only a fledgling druid, changes his form of choice at the last moment and becomes....</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue calls a spirit bat to his side and instructs it to follow Dieter down into the hole and be his eyes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spider moves 20 feet per 6 seconds.  SpiDieter crawls vertically down the shaft, moving swiftly.  Three hundred feet down, a full minute and a half later, the spider feels the wall turn away ninety degrees to create the ceiling of a massive cavern.  Stalactites dot the roof of the cavern, making it difficult for the spider to see farther than five feet in front.  From this vantage point, the spiDieter cannot see the floor of the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The bat sees Dieter continuing down the ladder, does a quick 100ft lap of the cavern ceiling, then begins heading back up to Maouelue to report.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat, who has excellent echolocation, scopes out the cavern and maps it mentally for Maouelue...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ladder lets out into the SE corner of the cavern.  The bat could <i>not</i> get a good estimate on how <i>deep</i> the particular areas of water are, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the news and is at least glad to hear that there is a indeed a bottom to the pit...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He sighs in resignation and produces a mage hand to assist the fellows in their descent. He sends Stenchy down first as he has the heaviest armor and focuses the hand on him.</i></p></div>
