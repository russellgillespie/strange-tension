<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger hops deftly over the bog in one go, grabs the two satchels.  But just as he's jumping back over, the goblin weapon lurches and throws of Daran's balance by just enough.  He lands just a couple feet shy of the edge of the bog.  Quickly, he standing-jumps out, but falls to his knees, clasping his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shakes his head, stands, and hands the bags to Maouelue.  "If there's anything edible in there, I'd appreciate a bite and a rest."  He smiles at Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Eh, let’s see what kind of piss these goblins feats upon them...”</p><p></p><p>Maouelue inspects the packs carefully before opening, lest the goblins had something nasty in store...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first bag is muddy and ill-kept.  It has pouches on the sides, but they are empty on inspection.  A thin flap of material covers the opening of the bag.  As Maouelue opens it, he finds some bits of hard tack and jerky.  Both smell a little stale, but edible.  At the bottom of the bag are a very nice set of bone dice.  Lastly, a platinum amulet with a strange symbol weighs the satchel down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Amulet Charm</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue tosses the rations over to Daran, stows the bone dice, then inspects the amulet further.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other satchel has a pair of boots.  They do not look goblin made.  There's blood on the cuff of one of them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After much contemplation on the necklace, Maouelue can't seem to place the symbol.  Daran is <i>very</i> thankful for the food.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ground starts to rumble, out of nowhere.  Daran gives Maouelue a <i>not again</i> look, and takes up his bow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think I might be too old for this..." says Daran as another moss-and-mud-streaked obelisk emerges from the forest floor 20ft from their location.  Immediately behind the two heroes, the black ooze starts moving their direction while the trees between them and the sludge start deteriorating fast.</p><p>"I fucking hate this place."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Elven reflexes honed from battle, the two sprint from standing and leap the last bit, just before the ooze reaches them.  </p><p></p><p>As they lie sprawled on the forest floor, panting, a tendril of goo reaches up, is met by more, and they combine to make a humanoid monstrosity covered in blinking eyes and popping sludge bubbles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The <i>thing</i>  wobbles, quakes... then speaks.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a voice that can only be described as gelatinous material being pushed through a sieve, the words roil out, attacking the heroes' senses.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You are quick.  We were hoping for a snack.  The goblins and their mounts will have to do.  When you see Titania, give her a message from us.  We are here.  And we are coming.  First her lands. Then her people.  Then," it makes a disgusting <i>slurrrping</i> sound.  "Then we come for her."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stares in horror at the bog beast, shocked into stillness for a moment, then righting himself and calling back, "We'll see about that you disgusting slime. A new light shines on these lands that you cannot hope to drench in your foul darkness. Go back to the brimstone quagmire whence you came!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Big words for one so young.  And small.  Deliver my message or no.  It matters not.  All come to me in the end."  And it melts back into the bog.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds later, a flash of blue light appears a distance away, in the direction of the forever setting sun.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue lets out a deep breath with eyes closed as the fiend leaves, then looks up at the horizon, letting the light sear into his eyes and warm his plate. The flash pours in through his eyes to his soul, scouring the remnants of fear and disgust that sought to take root there from this latest encounter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us away, pray that the eladrin find us."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the duo shield their eyes to look into the sunset, they see forty or so winter eladrin running through the forest clearing towards them, Otirnis in the lead.  Bellatrix can also be seen, just behind the lady eladrin.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Noticing the ranks and...Bellatrix...rushing in, Maouleue dusts himself up and stands tall, propping Daran up into a casually relaxed posture as he does. </p><p></p><p><i>Yes, that will have the desired effect.</i></p></div>
