strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, raises an eyebrow at the man’s show of resistance. He leaves the man probe for a moment and searches the disheveled room for another spare bit of rope or any kind of cord.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks around for rope and finds three different types.  With this being partly a fishing shop, there are many styles and lengths of fishing lines.  There are hempen ropes as in the style dungeoneers carry.  Lastly, there is a nasty bit of barbed rope.  Looks a bit like twine spliced with brambles every few inches.  Used typically to keep rodents away from produce.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter snorts in sadistic amusement as he grabs a length of hempen rope and pulls an end of it through the man’s bindings and ties it off securely. He then throws the other end over the hanging light fixture and tests it for load bearing by tugging on the loose end.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is about to hang it up, then realizes there is no way this thing is going to hold the man's weight.  It's about to come out of the ceiling bolting at any time.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He frowns slightly and looks instead for a joist to hurl it over instead.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The entire place is trashed.  If you took some time, you could make something.  You might be able to use magic.  Looks like there is a door to the back room, you might be able to use that, too.  The room just isn't yielding much in the way of what you need.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter growls in frustration, pulls the rope back and drags the man toward the back room</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He opens the door and inspects the surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This room was mainly used for business.  There's a desk that's been overturned on the far side, an window broken beyond it.  Parchment and papers are strewn all around, crunching under foot.  A large old wardrobe is in the corner, very thick, looks to be made of solid oak.  There also is a now tattered rug on the ground, but it looks to have been of a good quality when it was hale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter lays down the rope for now, rights the desk and inspects the wardrobe.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man has stopped laughing at this point.  He bangs his head on the floor every now and again, though.  The desk produces nothing of interest, it's been ransacked well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first thing you notice about the wardrobe is, when you swing the doors wide, at the top of the doors, a two pronged hook is fashioned at the top.  You assume this for heavy pelts or coats used in the winter.  (Investigation for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There're some winter clothes in the wardrobe, heavy furs and such, all off their hangers and in a pile on the bottom.  A purple piece of cloth is hanging from a crossbow bolt in the middle of the back wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the cloth and bolt.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are runes, arranged in a circle.  Blood stains parts of the cloth.  The man on the floor starts laughing again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls the bolt free and grabs the cloth. He turns around and drives the bolt into the man’s upper leg.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A scream of pain, the man's head thrashes side to side.  A stream of expletives issue forth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A beat or two more, he picks his head up to look at you.  He looks Dieter dead in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I know you, your whole crew, are dead men.  Dead.  Men."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hoists the man into the closet and hooks his bindings onto the hook. He closes the door in the man’s face and throws the net of invisibility over the wardrobe. He glances again at the rune cloth and tucks it into his pocket before hastening out to the front door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man was shouting as you were trussing him up.  When the net of invisibility went over him, not only did the entire wardrobe vanish, his shouts cut off as he was never there.  There were portions of the bottom that weren't covered by the net, but with the craziness of the room, it's hard to tell until the room is cleared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter heads out the front door, he sees Frenchy coming toward him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy recounts what has transpired.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks to the stars.  He feels the weight of the day, aches start to reach into his muscles.  He is weary, emotionally and physically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s eyes, dark already, go completely black at these tidings. He starts walking toward the inn, then stumbles slightly. He leans an arm on Frenchy as they walk back toward the inn.</i></p></div>
