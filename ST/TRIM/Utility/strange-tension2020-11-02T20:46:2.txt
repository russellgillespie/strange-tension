<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A rough grunt escapes the druid, a hint of a growl still on his voice.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue flits around inspecting the finer points of shadow and highlight, his eye is drawn to the silver ring. He sets his drawing down in his pack and moves to it, hovering his palm over it feeling for traces of the arcane.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"Oh Bahamut...guide me in my search."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard waves his hand and checks for traces of the arcane, a voice utters deep in his mind.  He cannot understand the words, but they are foreboding, menacing.  Guttural grunts mixed with hisses echo in the man's head.  There is a whisper of common underlying everything, though.  It sounds like "weapon".</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls his palm back, frowning gravely. He then waves the group to the opposite room, leaving this coffin open for the time being.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They proceed across the corridor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room opposite is structured exactly like this one, except for a décor of magic, there is a ambiance of learning and scholar here.  There is a small bookshelf in the corner, all of the items are withered to dust though.  The coffin opens on a smallish serpent-scholar, bedecked in tattered robes of deep blue and silver.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue bends in closer to the serpent scholar looking for any symbols of devotion or knowledge that might have been lain with the form.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's professional curiosity is stoked as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two blink at each other simultaneously.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a serpent eating it's own tail, but there seems to be something else about that symbol.  Neither of you can tell what's odd about it, though.  (Religion check for more info on the symbol)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue takes the point of his blade and begins slicing out the symbol, the tucks it into his book.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid thinks back over his many years of observance for his religion.  Nothing stands out directly, but something about a long-lost or ousted serpentine race once idolized the symbol nags the back of his mind.  Nothing specific comes together for either of the men.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With great care Maouelue slices a thin layer of the clay placing it in between the pages of his diary and closing it hard. He walks back across the hallway and begins to skewer the ring on the tip of his sword.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stands back half amused, half sickened at the sound of echoing metal.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It’s quite a scene to see such a fearsomely clad being taking such gentle care of these idols.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leans back and pops another bottle of red.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The finger comes off along with the ring.  The clay statue was hollow and filled with a poisonous gas.  As the gas seeps out, Maouelue clocks it early and is able to jump out of the room in time.  It dissipates, only delivering one point of damage to the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the group sees a greenish haze filtering out of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue steps out of the room. Heading for the last door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter sees the second bit of poison in as many encounters, he changes out his rings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The oaken door at the end of the hall stands imposing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The troupe now convened at the oaken door, where Maouelue raises the hilt of his sword and bashes it into the center, knocking hard three times.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It sounds loud.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two roguish types pull at the handles instead, shaking their brows mildly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Locked.  (Perception check or strength check to force the door.)</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ceiling creaks and suddenly <i>cracks</i> releasing the massive wood beam.  It comes barreling down, catching <i>everyone</i> by surprise.  It drives through the party and into the door, smashing it and bringing the whole lot with it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is brought to for a moment, his newfound zeal having gotten the better of him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group is bodily thrown into the next room, they are knocked down prone.</p></div>
