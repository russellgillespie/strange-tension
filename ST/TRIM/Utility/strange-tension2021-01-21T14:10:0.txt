strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>There are three smaller books that explain the Rites of Trial for commoners to become lords, lords to become nobles, and nobles to sit on the Court.  There are rituals and rites for having mortals (primarily elves, but the text is hazy) become permanent citizens of the Feywild.  In an obscure text, it tells of the Trials of the Eldar.  The Eldar were a group of the eldest nobles in five families.  Upon one occasion, it was necessary to choose an heir between several of a noble line.  The Five created the trials to help in this process, and it has been a hidden rite of passage for nobles wanting to contest their stations, or to claim a birthright.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The only thing about the actual trials themselves is that they are a secretive selection of scenarios that test a person beyond their imagining.  And that the end boon is typically one of the family's choosing, not necessarily a Feywild-specific or Court related prize.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lastly, there are three thick books on the subject of travel through the planes.  A particularly deep on is all about the creation of portals and crossovers.  Another is a philosophical discussion on the formation and design of the planes.  To better know the structure, it posits, one would better know the transportation options available.  Lastly, the third book is an old tome, cracked leather exposing fragile pages seemingly made of woven fibers.  The text in this is foreign to Maouelue and Daran, consisting of mainly pictures.  Notes in another strange language line the pages throughout, and even are interspersed within the pictures.  It is a cacophony of information, none of which makes much sense to the two adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us find carriage to the South. I would see of this Lanrion's Tower in order to best make our plans henceforth. I could use the time to review a few of these materials as we pass."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On of the guards pipes up and says, "We would be happy to procure that for you.  The Queen said if you require transport, we were to set it up under her personal envoy.  If you would excuse me, I will make preparations for a transport to pick you up here.  Unless you would like to meet them elsewhere?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a look around the streets, ah, we could perhaps do our waiting somewhere with a bit of vittles if that would suit. I'm quite keen to try the local fare. I've heard rumour of some new bread and cheese dish with tomatoes or something to that effect, I wonder if you could point us to your favorite haunts? Might there be anything like that around here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guard gives you a curious look.  "I am... unaware of any new dishes.  Of course, pardon my saying so, you are from the material plane."   He pauses to think.  "Just down the Sun Walk you'll find my favorite place for fare and drink.  The Queen's Smile is just north of here.  It's no tavern or inn, either, they just specialize in..  ah, vittles, I believe you mentioned?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ha! My mistake good elf! It would seem I am not <i>quite</i> adjusted to life on this side of the veil just yet! Yes yes, The Queen's Smile has the ring of goodness about it. What say you meet us there and we'll have your favorite ordered and ready for your return?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps as if pinched, and says, with a widening smile, "For true?!  Well...  that would be wondrous indeed.  And I thank you, kind sirs," he stammers.  "I'll go now.  My favorite dish is the baked Chaos Sunfish.  Make sure you try the goldflower buns, too.  They're fantastic!"  With a big smile on his face, he makes his way back to the castle.  Daran chuckles as he goes.  "Think you made that one's month, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Heh, well we'll see how my wallet fares...I don't know what this might run me yet...But yes, he did seem quite keen."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We could always say we're the land's newest saviors, eh?  Might be a discount in that?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well...someday we may need to lean into that persona a bit, but for now let us keep a modest profile. It would not do the swagger just yet."</p></div>
