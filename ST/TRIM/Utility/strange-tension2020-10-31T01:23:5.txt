strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>As he rises, he looks at the frenchmen, their new brethren. He holds a hand to each of their shoulders and says a prayer. He traces the mark of Bahamut in his minds eye as they disappear back into the ether...back into the mirror. A sad, yet pure knowing sets over him as he begins to don the now-empty plate mail. He affixes the Giantess Bracers and Frostbitten Helm. He sets his scabbard to his waist and picks up Frenchy's dagger. Digging around in his pack for a moment, he pulls out a stray piece of silver ore that must have settled to the bottom during their journey. Holding it over the fire with the dagger, he warms the metal and it drinks in the firelight. Bringing it back out, he sets it on the Shield of Disruption and begins shaping it into a draconic form. A symbol for his new devotion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he's melding the silver, the feeling of a human hand rests on his shoulder.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue turns, expecting to see the stranger from the fight before.  Instead, he sees a blond man, ethereal, radiating powerfully bright aura around him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your faith will be your reward.  Know that I will be here, watching over you.  When you most need me, look to the East, look for your patron."</p><p>He touches your shoulder, sending radiant energy through the wizard's body.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he disappears, and Maouelue looks back to the shield, you sense the metal is different now.  On closer inspection...  the metal dragon is platinum.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>An ebullition of all proportions sears into the cavity in Maouelue's chest, swelling him from his very core outward. A divine pride and devotion seem to reinforce the very sinews of his being. He picks up the shield and slings it over his left arm. His fingers grip the hilt of the sword and he unsheathes it, holding it point upward directly between his eyes. He lets the firelight bend off the sharpened edges of his sword into the back of his mind. Then he stands his silent vigil over the camp.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p></p><p>Dieter is all at once taken aback and on board with the mission. Whatever this new faith was, it would clearly help lead to the destruction of this coven that seemed to be taking him further and further from his homelands. He longs for a sight of the sea, and the liquid reflections of the pure metal on Maouelue's shield briefly take him there. He nods back into the unrelenting stare. Gathering up what bits of equipment the henchmen...no! Frenchy and Stenchy...had left behind. He remembers something suddenly, then looks around the scene.<i>Dieter is all at once taken aback and on board with the mission.

<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, over here.  And it's Frume, lad."  He chuckles.  Dieter clocks him using a knife on the orc leader.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Right, right."  He rips something from the orc's hide, wipes his knife on the dead creature's ragged clothing, and sheaths it.  He puts the hide patch into his pack, then points E.  "A bit of a walk thata way is a stone entrance, 'bout 3 feet wide, 7 foot tall, aye?  All I know about it about seven or eight of those bastards guarding it.  The orcs that came through here got into a scrape with them, couldn't quite see if they finished all of the snakies, but that might be a good place to start for the day?"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group wastes no time setting out, they pack up their gear and Dieter reappropriates a few of the items he had given to Frenchy. The trio stride over to the stone entrance, Maouelue's heavy armor making no secret of their approach.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The march of the heavy plate echoing off the walls mingles with the illusion of a shimmering hum emanating from the Dragon Mage. The image of justice presses on unwaveringly to the lair of evil serpents.</i></p></div>
