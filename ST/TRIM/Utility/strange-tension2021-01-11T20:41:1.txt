strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Slowly, the normal sounds of the forest return.  The bright colors blossom into clearer view again.  The forest seems to <i>breathe</i> again.  The female eladrin is hovering over a semi-conscious Daran.  The old woman is bandaging the elven leader.  The giants start to collect small insects.  Unlike the material world, though, these go about their business with a precision and grace.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a matter of minutes, the great giants are bones left to bleach in the mottled sun that streams through the trees.  Again, an almost sun-set.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All are staring at Bellatrix, each other, the area around them in strange amalgam of horror and relief.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue rises to his feet and solemnly walks over to the witch. He looks deep into her eyes as he kneels and offers his hand in assistance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That was quite a show of force my lady.” he whispers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She rises, shyly.  Gingerly.  "Thank you, kind wizard."  (Perception or insight check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage can't tell specifically, but something seems off about Bellatrix.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles demurely and then hastens to her sister, administering to the elven group leader.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His eyes follow her retreat and linger a moment, nonplussed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns back to the spot where the dread dragon had plummeted into the earth. He rests his palms on the ground, eyes closed, feeling...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks the area but it is crystal clear of arcana.  Which is strange, because what you just saw was full of magic.  Or something of the like.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Perplexed but saying nothing, Maouelue moves back to join with the eladrin and the others. He walks up to them, deferentially.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf is still kneeling, looking abashed at Maouelue as he approaches.  "My sincerest apologies.  To you and your...  fellows,"  they breath heavily.  "I must say, your team fought extremely well against foes that have been known to ravage even the best of our fighters.  Even the half-elf fought valiantly."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Even?</i>,” Maouelue raises an eyebrow?</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed, all fought well and were it not for all of you here, I’m sure my days would be passed. I am indebted to you all.”</p><p></p><p>As he says this, his eyes linger on Bellatrix’s.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix blushes and looks away. (Smiling?)  The old woman nods and stands up, admiring her work.   Then whips the net around her shoulders.  She does not go invisible.  </p><p></p><p>Daran is led over, helped by the woman eladrin, who is also nursing a broken right arm.  Bellatrix rushes to her, as does the old woman, and they both start healing the two warriors.  </p><p></p><p>The leader says, "My name is Erifias.  This is Otirnis.  We are Winter Eladrin, not born in  this section of the Glimmerwood, but stationed to protect it.  Our lands...  Well, as you can see, our lands are in constant peril.  Our people die daily from raids of the shadar-kai and other fell monstrosities that are crossing at will into Faerie.  It is everything we can do just to stem the tide.  Lately, though...  Something is different.  The veil.  It is thinning.  Not only here, but to your world as well."  They take a very deep breath and wince.  They're covered in bruises that are turning a beautiful dusky purple.  They would be beautiful, at least, if there wasn't so many of them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I...  am sorry for our treatment of you.  All of you."  They raise their eyes slightly towards Daran, who nods respectfully.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And, although I hate to even ask as I know you have a mission of your own,  I would be delinquent in my duties if I didn't ask for your aid.  If you were to help us, I could take you directly to Titania, or any of the eladrin courts you would prefer to speak with.  You would have our loyalty.  As the worlds are today, that would be no small thing."  They smile at you all.  "As yours would be to us."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods at you and gets up, weakly.  He starts heading over as Erifias says, "Thank you for your kind words, cousin elf.  It does lift our spirits an elf-kin has come to see Faerie in...  well, in most of her glory, anyway.  Let us treat wounds and heal, then I will take you to our court and tell you of the land and our troubles."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue returns the recognition with a nod, then moves over to check on Daran’s wounds first before looking in on Bellatrix’s condition.</p></div>
