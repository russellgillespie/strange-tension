<div class="character-1"><p>The crew travels lightly, all three moving with amazing stealth and precision.  Only once does Daran think he sees something following them, and backtracks a bit.  After a few minutes, he rejoins the group and pushes them on.  As the clouds open up, the trio emerges from a group of trees and the village of Oakhurst is visible on the horizon.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A wave of emotion overcomes Ouelue as (s)he sees the town for the first time in what feels like weeks underground. Anxious to determine Dieter’s dilemma, (s)he pushes forth with haste.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage enters a surreal town, one he knows and doesn't at the same time.  Burned buildings, few children and families are in the streets.  The dead lay with rain pattering them, only those they left behind to carry them to their graves.  </p><p></p><p>There are a handful of buildings still upright and somewhat intact.  The inn, the tavern, a few homes, Vam's ranch...   These all, at least from first glance, seem okay.  The three enter the crossroads proper and scan in all directions.  The Runemark's men didn't raze everything, but the town is still only a shell of it's former self.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stands speechless. he cannot fathom what kind of evil soul would do such a thing. </p><p>“Those bastards will pay for this...”</p><p>He leads the group onward toward the ranch, hoping to get a word in with Vam and potentially Heston before heading into the wreckage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group turns W, led by Ouelue, they see a rough-and-tumble man, early thirties, dusty blonde hair tied into a tight bun at the back of his head, stubble darkening his weather-beaten face.  He leads a big brown gelding NW through the town.  He wears normal rancher's clothes, but atop them, a set of emerald green snakeskin chaps, a vest, and bracers indicate him as Heston, the tailor/ranch-hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"That's a fine bit of snakeskin work there...Reminds me of a time I loaned out summat around these parts."</p><p>Ouelue winks meaningfully at Heston. </p><p>"I have desire to speak to Vam and hit Leatherworker as well. We bring tidings from the Manor..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranch-hand gives the group a strange, suspicious look.  "Aye, head over yon.  Vam's a bit beat up, but he'll see ya.  It's a bad time to be comin' inta town, just to let y'all know.  I'd be headin' out as soon as ye can.  Just some friendly advice."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman grabs Ouelue by the arm.  "Excuse me, miss.  If I could have that letter back, I must deliver it right away to the Pig and Falcon.  I appreciate all your help.  Both of you."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes yes, of course. Here. And your pin as well.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue waits for her to be out of earshot, then leans closer to Heston.</p><p>He whispers,</p><p>“It is I...Maouelue. Prithee take a moment to catch me up with Vam...”</p><p>“...That is some fine snakeskin.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman nods, and leaves quickly, making for the tavern.  Looking at it, the Pig and Falcon is surprisingly free of burn marks...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston does a double take, then looks Ouelue deep in her eyes.  He drops the reins and gives the mage a hug, saying, "I knew you'd come back.  The others...  they said you'd abandoned us to those monsters, but Vam and I...  we'd knew you'd come back to help."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue surprises himself with how passionately he returns the embrace. He is <i>relieved</i> to be back in town regardless of its state. There are wrongs here that need to be righted, and the return of Heston to his sight instills the vigor of purpose and direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, this is my good man Heston. He is a friend in this. Come Heston, let us away with these tidings to Vam.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A bit embarrassed, but still a hardened cattle-man, breaks away from Maouelue/Ouelue.  He then shakes the rangers hand.  Surprisingly it is Daran that looks sheepish.  (Insight check for more!)</p></div>
