strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  Lets make our way...  west.  Should be that way, might be able to find a way up.  Still think the best way out is through these catacombs."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Frume. Let us continue on cautiously. Stand back and if I am apprehended, you flee.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pushes up to the next corner and peeks around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Like hell I will.  No one gets outta here alive on their own.  Least that's what I heard.  Nothing down here we can't handle, right?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Right. Let’s do this.” Dieter stops himself a moment. “You think there’s equipment in the catacombs?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think there might be.  Could be rusted all to shite, but it'll be better than anything we got at the moment."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the pair peer left, they see a wall at the end of a very short hall.  (Perception check, please!  Also, afk for kiddos bedtimes.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter senses that there's something off about the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks for a non-magical stone to throw at it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter tosses a rock at the wall...  and it passes through.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sheeeiiiiiit. Let’s go!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You might be too excited about this, let me head in first.  If there is someone over there, they might recognize me."  He pushes by and steps through the barrier.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Now what is this guy up to?...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume picks his head back through. </p><p>"You're...  You're gonna wanna see this.  Put something over your nose, first, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter finds two lesser pebbles with which to snuff his snout, then follows Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What in the buddy Bahamut is this!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You walk into a nightmare.  Bloody implements are hanging on the wall and strewn about tables.  Blood is staining the walls and floor, some dried, some still very wet.  A trail is coming from a wooden door in the N wall.  On the table against the W wall, a dissected body is displayed.  Parts of the man's body and sections of skin have been completely removed.  (Perception check or Investigation if you want something specific.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter walks over to the body and tries to remember the rituals depicted in the vault. Was this akin to any of them? Was there a pattern to this...vivisection? <i>And just what kind of implements do we have here?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume...do you know about any of this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I knew they were doing experiments down here, but I just thought it was of the arcane persuasion.  Trying to break the anti-magic barrier, that sort of thing.  This..."  He looks like he's going to be sick.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks over the body.  It does look familiar to what you've seen before in the vault, more depraved though.  Not a specific pattern that he can tell.  There are all sorts of torture, butchering, and slicing equipment.  If you wanted to grab something as a weapon, you'll have a selection to choose from.  (Investigation check for weaponry.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find 3 rusted daggers, caked in blood.  You also find one <i>very</i> sharp sickle.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Guess these'll have to do." He takes a sickle and a dagger and hands the other two to Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Been a while since I used one of these, but...it's just like riding a dolphin."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume also finds a rusted dagger and a makeshift club.</p><p>"Thank ye, friend.  Ne'er had a chance to ride a dolphin.  Gods willing, I'll be able to try when I get back to the sea!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah the sea...Someday Frume. And I haven't forgotten about our promise either..." He looks meaningfully at the crippled man and then blushes at handing him two daggers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well anyway...you can throw them too...Never can have...enough...daggers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You notice as you hand him the daggers...   his has both of his hands.</p><p>"Aye, true!"  He flips the two with both hands, then pockets them.  He's got the dagger in his left hand, the club in his right.  "To the door, then?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter blinks in amazement. "Well...I guess...now I know why I forgot! What in the nine– How?!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"How, what?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your–Your handS!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Updated and saved data for The Frumious Bandersnatch!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shakes his head once more in amazement and begins to head north toward the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, the hand, yeah!  Had a good healer in camp.  And someone willing to lend me a...  hand!  Eh?  Eh?  All right, lets go through the door.  You checking it for traps, or should I?"</p></div>
