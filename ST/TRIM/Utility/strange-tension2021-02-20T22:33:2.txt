strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>As the boat crests the edge, Maouelue gets a view of a massive cavern, strewn with rock crevasses, lava flows, and a huge waterway interconnecting everything.  A variety of beasts can be heard growling throughout, and, just as he's about to plummet over the lip, he sees an <i>enormous</i> being in the center, carrying a greatclub over a shoulder.  Then, they plummet...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ice boat descends into the cavern, a multitude of other waterfalls mix and add to the chaos.  Judging the distance down at near 200 feet, Maouelue and his crew brace for impact into the fluid below.  Fluid, not water.  He sees, as it comes up quickly, that it's a brownish, greenish soup.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's difficult to breathe now as the air in this portion of the mountain is steeped in lava ash and soot.  The boat melts on the way down.  The four are plunged into the depths of the fluid and find that they cannot see right in front of them.  It's a struggle to get back to the surface as the liquid is very thick, viscous.  (Dex saves, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue breaks the water, followed closely by Bellatrix and Benna.  Immediately, they're all caught in a current that pulls them farther down.  Daran is able to land clear of the current, and he breaks the surface... without the others.  He tries to check on the others, but he can't see more than a couple inches in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He dives down once, twice.  He still can't see them and can't tell where they might be.</p></div>
