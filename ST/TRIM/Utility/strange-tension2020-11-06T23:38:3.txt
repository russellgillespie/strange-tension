strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The mage looks over to Frume.  He looks...  astonished.  "I have no fuckin' idea what's going on right here."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i> anyway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They turn and Dieter begins to lead them back to the statue,  the one with the difficult-to-displace eyes...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(I keep on doing this, I apologize...)</p><p>There is a larger exit to the room on the opposite side from the party.  One small route to the SE and one fairly large exit to the N.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter leaves them all looking a bit confused, but heads back to the junction between the burning statues and the golden snake behind the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He rushes down to open the door then heads back to the junction. Pulling out the Rod of Sky Fire again, he kisses it quickly then sends a blast at the golden figure, ducking behind the wall and into the corridor as it explodes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few moments pass, but no explosion happens.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter has been plugging his ears, but doesn’t feel the expected rumble. He peeks around the corner real sneaky like.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing doing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid is intrigued. He decides he had better show the others. He runs to get them and to show a repeat of the trick. This time he stands farther back and watches.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares intently as the firework blast travels down the hallway, waiting...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The firework hit the statue head-on, exploding.  It is a very nice show.  But the statue still stands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter runs up to it and tries to carve at the gold with his blade trying to see if it will peel or dent at all.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It does not.  (Strength check and then Wisdom save for Dieter.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Good rolls!)</p><p>The gold gives under the blade a bit, Dieter feels it give but checks again, it doesn't score at all.  There is a tug at the back of his mind, but it goes away just as quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He says a word in Giant. The word from the other statue above so long ago.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gold glints in the torchlight.  Other than that, nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to turn it on the platform.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue put their backs into it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a few minutes of pushing and pulling, the idol hasn't moved an inch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries to remember a few of the words he uttered to the snake-stone door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Open"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tugging at the back of Dieter's mind turns into a whisper.</p><p></p><p><i>"Why?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"For Briffo."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"I don't know a... Briffo.  I know only Muhlens.  Who are you?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I am the one they call Deleter."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We come on on behalf of the Muhlens"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"My name is Quetza.  I am the keeper of the Muhlens secrets."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hozieh sent us to sspeak with you."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"They have never mentioned a...  Deleter.  Tell me, do you know the key?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reaches in his pocket and pulls out a piece of parchment covered in a circle of runes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>There are many keysss in thiss world ssir.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls out a bottle of the venom.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Which would you have of me?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Am I?  What did you say your name was, again?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That depends what form I take. If you take my meaning.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Hmmm...  That as may be.  It is true for me as well.  Tell me of Lord Muhlen.  Why has he not been to this altar recently?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“At last we come to the end of the riddles and get down to the tidings I would bear...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Lord Muhlen...has perished. The citizens of Oakhurst formed a fanatical brotherhood and have ssecretly taken the Lord from usss. While the daughterss sseek vengeance, I have been ssent to sseek your counssel...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Very well.  You may recieve my counsel after you pass this tesssstttt..."</i>  </p><p>The voice fades and a small opening morphs into the center of the statue.  What looks like now molten gold ripples throughout the statue.  It seems something is to be presented.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The heroes turn their heads toward each other and smirk, tilting their necks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks on over your shoulders, curious.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the Staff of Baobab and inserts it into the the golden solar plexus.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks at Maouelue</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The things I do for Life...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter moves to insert the stalk of the staff into the beckoning golden space.  Just as it is about to break the surface of the statue, Frume reaches out a hand and stays Dieter.</p></div>
