strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The creatures look upon the image in awe, mouths agape, some drooling.  They stop what they're doing to watch the rock bards magically emerging from their hole in the wall.  A few sacks hit the floor, spilling their contents.  This breaks the creatures from their awestruck attention on the party, some start scrabbling to return the items back to the bags.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Prepare ye the way of the horde."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gets into the mood of the thing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few start to goggle at the group whilst the rest try to pack up their bags.  One does and quickly throws himself off of the edge of the pit, into the darkness below!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Stay yourselves! Throw yourselves not into the Abyss! You may still redeem yourselves! Come look upon the horde and prosper!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few more jump down the hole, but the rest patiently await your commands.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last one drops down the hole, a few moments pass.  Then a rumbling from the bottom of the pit greets the party.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh dear, didn’t we deal with it properly?” Dieter posits aside to Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't know, dont really care to find out, honestly.  Anything we need from this place?  If not...  I think I'm ready to find my asshole of a father."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>It had been quite a journey to find the treacherous patriarch. It would be a shame to deny Jaecob his destiny. </p><p></p><p>“Stand back and ye shall not be harmed!” </p><p></p><p>Dieter beckons Flayco and Shelli to move out before him as a grotesque honor guard, shooing away the remaining gawkers. </p><p></p><p>“Those with knowledge of these halls…step forth and be rewarded.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They have no clue what you're saying, they're just reacting to the tone so far.  They look back and forth between themselves.  One of the ones that fled climbs back up, grabs a would be groupie, and pulls/throws it down the pit before it jumps in too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ugh, never mind.” Dieter walks out of the cloud and moves to the small door to the NNW, muttering about cretins and fools.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Perhaps his menagerie was quite large enough already.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door grates against the floor but the it opens fully.  Hallways stretch beyond the doorway, hooking around slightly to the right, where it opens into an alcove with two doors leading E.  One is ajar and Dieter can see the long open room with the banners beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes this corridor to be a hallway between the rooms they've already explored. He considers what they had been running from and continues down the hall, listening for traces of the band of thieves they had escaped.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the kobolds parachute (sans parachute) down the pit, the rumbling subsides as the foursome leave for better environs.  The hallways are dank and devoid of life.   It doesn't seem like anyone has been through here in decades, maybe even generations.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doorway leads to the hall of banners, where Lord Muhlen introduced himself in all his ghostly form.   The only door that hasn't been tried is the E door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They go to there.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter inspects the door and tries to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens smoothly.  A small 20x20 room welcomes them.  A door stands in the NE wall.  Greasy ash and creosote is burned into the floor in front of another carcass of a tent, as in the other room with the purple gems.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brings everyone inside and begins inspecting the room, moving quickly through to the other door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bags Dieter finds are complete tatters, nothing usable for carrying.  There is, however, a strange area within the tent that catches Jaecob's attention.  He waves you over and shows you a depression in the wall, what would have been the back of the tent.  "Whatcha make of this.  Maybe another dragon egg den?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, let’s find out. We need more pieces to this puzzle.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a closer look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter peers at the stone wall.  There does seem to be a seam in the wall.  One good push, maybe?...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He prods at it with the wave-blade end of his staff.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It feels like pushing into stone.  A couple prods into it, some small pebbles come loose and fall to the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter picks up the stones and closes his eyes, whispering word of the waves waking the water walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He hurls three stones all together at the breach.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter throes a trio of stones at the depression, and all in one instant, there's an opening there.  A set of stairs greets the adventurers, but there is no light in the corridor beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well well well...the mystery deepens."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Here, this will light the way." he says, descending the stairs.</p></div>
