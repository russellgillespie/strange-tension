strange-tensionThe bracelet section of one levitates and tries to clamp itself on him!  He deftly dodges, but everyone notices the manacles closest to the group start trying to latch themselves onto the heroes!  (Dex saves!)


The mage dodges away as one comes near.  Just as Frume and the wizard move toward the exit at the N wall of the room, Dieter's arm and leg feel the manacles attach!
(Dex save again for Dieter!)

The druid is able to avoid having another manacles clamp down, but the others are still holding him back.
*Dieter yanks back on the manacles, he pulls them taut, stretching their links across the room.*
*Maouelue pulls his sword from it's scabbard and slashes down hard across them.*

Maouelue slices through the arm chains, causing a spark of blue to emit from the chains.  It falls to the ground and does not attack again.  The druid's leg is still manacled, and another bracelet comes to clamp down Dieter's other leg!

The manacle slips just past the druid's leg!

And the last chain breaks.  The other chains are hovering, waiting for the two.  Frume is holding, waiting to throw the door open for the others.


As Dieter gets clear of the swarm of manacles, Maouelue gets snagged on one.  It attaches itself to the man's foot, but not tightly.  Enough to make the wizard hop back, realizing he's snagged on something.

Another clean slice, and the three are away though the N doorway.  Frume shuts it behind the crew, saying, "That was fun, now, wasn't it?!"
The troupe is a hallway running N, ending in a T.
*Dieter peeks around the corner.*
To the left, a darkened room is ominous. To the right, a gaping chasm is a mere fifteen feet away.  There is a small ledge that runs on it's edge, N and S.
*The group turns back to the 4-way and inspect the phantasmal barrier.*



*They go to look at the paradoxical door to the north.*
The three approach the opaque glass-like substance of the orange-lit door.  There is no obvious sign of a knob or way to open it.  (How would the group like to attempt to open the door?)
*They don't yet attempt to open the door. They head back to the South end of the room and inspect the strange lock.*
The beautifully made door is solid iron.  Buffed to a fine polish, some of the filigree and hand-formed sections are minute, even for Maouelue's keen eye.  The scene depicts a two humanoids in a garden, surrounded by plentiful bounty.  Many animals set the scene as well, but eyes are drawn, either by some trick of the piece or magic, to a serpent in the center, twining it's way up the female's leg.
*Maouelue's eyes gleam a cold blue light from under his helm, sending a cross of radiance down upon the depiction.*
*Dieter inspects for a keyhole or mechanism.*
There is a keyhole, off to the right of center.  It seems to be ingratiated into the scene, it is a star on the horizon.  (History or Religion check for more.)  Hinges are on the left side of the door, massive iron buckles.


Mao is left scratching his head, but Dieter gets a ping, back in the recesses of his mind.  He remembers an old tale of a garden, hidden away from the world.  It was said that this garden was where the original elves came into Faerun, but they were deceived by the beings that were already present in the world.  There was something about a star leading them, and a star being the key to their salvation... but he just can't put his finger on the exact phrasing.
*Maouelue pulls out the snake amulet he has been carrying and inspects it more closely.*


Dieter keeps digging back, back, and remembers something else.  There were Naga present at that first meeting.  He remembers there was a massive battle, with the elves striving for a foothold on their new land, and the serpents trying to drive them back whence they came.  Maouelue remembers being a young boy and being told about these stories, how his people came from a land across the seas, out of time itself.  It is said that the stars hold the key to returning to that place.  But the way to travel the stars is long forgotten, lost to the ages and usurped by magic.
There is nothing about the amulet that is special or that stands out.  The serpent attached is a standard symbol of the ouroboros, the central icon of the Naga.
*Dieter looks down at the bone key he carries.*
*He thinks of all the bodies to which they've lain waste. He thinks of these accursed tunnels. And poor Culver! He must have met some terrible fate by now. It is all one mystery after another...Oh the torment!*
The bone gives Dieter no further insight into the mystery.  There is something, though...
Something odd about the construction.  And the material...
*Dieter holds it up to the group for a closer look.*


"Daaaah Frooom...caaan yu halp mie wiph thaaiiiis..?"
Frume looks at Dieter with serious concern.
"I mean to say, what do you make of the construction of this key?"
*As he tries to hand it to Frume, he drops it to the cavern floor.*
"Ah, well, ya know...  Seemed like the thing to do."
The bone key cracks down its length, but it is still in one piece.
*Dieter thinks for a moment, then tells the group to wait here while he check on something. He goes invisible then dashes away before a word can be uttered.*
