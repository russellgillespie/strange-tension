If only he had had someone at that moment to guide him down the right path, maybe he could have saved years of searching!

<div class="character-0"><p>"Lumaoue Luebeid, I have had many students in my time, yet none have seemed to match their thirst for knowledge and power with the scientific integrity and righteous empathy that I have seen from you over these past five years.

<div class="character-0"><p><i>During their long toiling work building the staircase, the two adventurers combed the caverns quite a bit. One day they went over to inspect the giant rift they had been avoiding. It was time to take a closer look...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>After the toiling work of the forge, the two men decide to take a break and discover the mysterious chasm.  As they travel through the hallway,  the rift blooms into view.  Darkness swells both above and below.  A small sliver of light can be seen far above them, below is complete blackness.  There is a small walkway that meanders both north and south, clinging precariously to what now looks like the edge of a massive stone edifice.  Bats flit about, not threatening the group.  There are some other flying animals mixed in with them, slightly larger, but nothing is posing a threat at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the chasm a moment, then begins to concentrate. Dieter can an ethereal form beginning to coalesce up in the swarm of bats. After a few moments, he understands and looks to back to the mage, now fully in the midst of his ritual. He keeps an eye out for the time being while the familiar descends and binds to Maouleue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>After an hour of this, the wizard comes to and blinks twice at the bat which then immediately zooms upward toward the light above piercing the dark.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He attends a report, telepathic or otherwise about how high it is and what lies above. Should there be any means escalating this slope, the wizard would ask to know of it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat flies... flies... flies...  At the edge of it's telepathic link, it relays to the wizard all it can see. The opening is getting closer, looks to be a scar-shaped gash in the world.  At best guess, before the bond breaks, it's maybe 200ft above the two.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue instructs the bat to fly up to the surface then come back down and report.</i></p></div>
