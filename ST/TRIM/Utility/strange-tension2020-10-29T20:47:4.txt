strange-tensionThe bolt clangs off his shield.  He lowers it, grinning at the group.  He takes the other bolt Frenchy shot, which was lodged in his thigh.  Pulls it out while keeping his eyes locked on you all.  Shows it to you.  And tosses it over his shoulder.  He cracks his neck and looks at his companion.  
"Show them the meaning of pain, Nezzul."
The other orc grunts as he starts to run toward the pack, pulling out a menacing looking greataxe...


(Can he stand on the same tile, or does he have to complete the move through?

When the flames die down, the orcs are still standing.  The one to the wizards right looks to be on death's door.  But the other one...
It smiles.  "Look who came out to play..."




*Dieter quaffs*


*Frenchy disappears and makes his way silently around the east side of the stone outcropping.*


*Stenchy spits on the orc‚Äôs corpse and sneers back at the boss.*

A rime of frost etches its way across the orcs shield.  He lets out a war cry, slings his shield on his back, and grips his blade with both hands...




The beastial humanoid looks sluggish as he swings.  He thought he brought more to this fight...

‚úÖ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Ape (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 18 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
*Frenchy completes his sneak up behind the orc leader and pulls out his blades.*




"Not again, little man..."

He growls as he misses the lithe elf.

As the elf falls from the last hit, he looks at the druid.  "Next?"  He readies his shield.








Just as the orc is about to attack the druid...

Target oc2 not found.


A dark figure emerges from the shadows, two rapiers poised to attack.  He yells out, "Hold on lads, help is on the way!" in a jaunty, sing-song voice.  The orc turns just as the first rapier come down.   The athletic orc has enough gumption to miss the first attack, but the second rapier comes around and the mysterious man *buries* it in the orc's chest.
The figure wipes the blood off his weapon and kneels down by the wizard.
"This man going to make it?"
*Dieter rifles furiously through the wizard‚Äôs pack, finding the swirling red elixir to stabilize his friend. He uncorks it and pours it down the prone, pleading man‚Äôs throat.*
"Whew, glad I was happening by!  You all seemed to have the majority at hand, though.  No worries, lads.  Anyone else need any healing?  I don't have any of those pretty bottles, but I do have some bandages and such, as it is."
He puts his hand out to help you up.
*As Maouelue rises, he feels a new kind of light in his heart. These brushes with death, these revivals, these dark forces gathering, his will...no, his duty to quell them with the divine light...Maouelue begins to feel his devotion coalesce. He must meditate on this soon.*
"Aye, lad," he claps Dieter on the shoulder.  "I'd love to hear your tale.  Myself, I've been tracking these here orcs.  Got away from me for a bit, but when I heard the commotion, I came as fast as I could."  To Maouelue, "Sorry I couldn't have been here before you fell, fella."
*Dieter chuckles under his breath at the light punnery.*
The man smiles at you from under a headscarf that seems to wrap around his head several times.  
"First, though, methinks you all might should be getting on towards your rest, aye?  I don't mistake too many campsites, and there seems to be one right here!"
*He gestures to the slain orcs.*
*Dieter leads them over to the camp but holds Frumious back a moment while the others head on.*
*Dieter falters for a moment and seems to slightly veer his statement as he continues.*
"...  Aye?  Indeed some interesting magics.  Okay, I won't be surprised if I'm left by my lonesome in the morn'!"  He puts out a hand.  "Folks who know me call me Frume, feel free to do the same, goodsir."  

"Oh, and... um.  If you don't mind, I'd like to pick over those brutes.  Sees if'n they have anything o'mine, aye?"
*Dieter considers a moment. Sizing the man up.*
"Eh, the Mu-lens you say?  Can't say I've heard of the name before.  I *have* had some run ins with the snaked variety, though.  Matter o'fact,  there's a opening to an underground lair.  Could be your problem's coming from yon, aye?"
The man starts riffling through the orcs possessions.
*Deiter rejoins the group and mulls this over, assessing these new developments. Only then does he realize he is still an ape and feels slightly abashed at his lack of...well, his appearance.*

The man looks up, sees Deiter change.  Then nods, appreciatively.
*Dieter fairly sulks over to the fire and sits down, brooding.*
*The henchmen begin singing a song about two worlds, opposite sides of a coin, the call of destiny. As their song drones on it mixes with the flames and the two heroes collapse in exhaustion.*
As the men sing, the head-wrapped man meanders over, pulls out a small viol and starts playing along.  He has a decent ear and plays the seemingly homemade instrument well.




You all believe it is fairly safe enough to finish your 'long' rest. üòÅ
"About as good a time as any, I suppose."  He pulls out a threadbare bedroll from a meager pack.  He stows his pristine swords at his side.
