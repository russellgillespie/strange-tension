strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The guards throughout the palace are at attention, saluting the team as the they exit the crystalline Castle of Starlight.  As the constant autumnal sun shines on the courtyard, a garrison of troops are waiting in salute there as well.  Four horses are waiting to take the group to the Eastern Docks.  Once there, they board a small ship that will take them down a tributary and into the Vale of Long Night.  From there, as the ship deposits the team in the freezing cold, the group looks over the barren wasteland of snow and ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Distance, like time in the Feywild, is amorphous.  Malleable.  From the map, looks like the destination is over a mountain range.  Maouelue sees a range to the north and one to the south.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage surveys the frozen lands, the iciness fields matching that of his heart. There is comfort in this, frost, the one thing he could always count on. He surveys the lands looking for a low point in the ranges ahead of their destination in readiness to push off.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The troupe starts as Maouelue picks a route towards the southern mountain range.  Tall peaks look daunting as they trudge through low snow drifts.   The group bundles up more and more as they walk on.  (Survival checks and Constitution saves from everyone.  Feel free to roll for the sisters, they're straight d20s.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The cold is getting to the group already.  (Three strikes means a level of exhaustion.  This early might be...  bad.)  The good news is that the sun stays out, no blizzard quite yet.   But those clouds to the north don't look good...  The group trudges on more.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The clouds from the north break in a monumental snow storm.  Suddenly, the group is surrounded by insane winds and they're having a hard time even seeing each other.  Daran yells back to the crew, "We should hunker down, stay put until the storm blows over."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The four huddle together under the thick boughs of a couple tightly knit together evergreen trees.  The wind whips, but the four travelers are safe and nestled quite snugly in their hideaway.  A couple hours later, the winds abate a touch.  A couple more hours after that , both the wind and the snow back off and it is safe to travel again.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran is worried, preoccupied by making sure the group members are okay.  Bellatrix sees them first, and tugs at Maouelue's arm.  There are huge, black creatures wandering over the snowy plain, near the mountain pass.  She tells the wizard that they are enormous, it's not just a perspective.  They are gaunt, maybe around 30 feet tall.  Wisps of black smoke are whipping off of the creatures.</p></div>
