strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue descends from the tree, more of the person on the other side of the rift becomes visible.  Standing comfortably, arms tucked into the front pockets of his robes, stands a young-ish man, human by all accounts, with a scraggly black goatee and dark black, lank hair hanging down.  He has a hint of a scar on his forehead that detracts a bit from his emerald green eyes.  He does not smile, nor does he scowl.  His countenance is...  very difficult to read, actually.  His robes are a good make, black again, and underneath, what Maouelue can see, are well made - possibly nobles? - clothing.  The boots are polished and impeccably shined, although they seem to be older.  The man gives off an air of intelligence, contemplation, and just a hint of smugness.  He eyes the wizard walking towards him.</p><p></p><p>In an almost monotone, very little inflection in his voice, he starts, "I wasn't expecting to be seeing you in quite this manner, brother.  What have you gotten yourself into to have the Prince connecting us like this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed, Brother, this was not how I expected it to be either. Funny, how everyone seems to know me already in these parts, yet, I suppose that’s natural for a rightful heir. Yes, I have come to reconcile my past with the Eladrin....,” he pauses a pregnant beat and searches deep in his pack for something, “...Father bade me deliver this to you.” He proffers the old scroll that Shi’Vandos had prepared for this very moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue reaches out to pass the scroll, it bumps against the barrier.</p><p></p><p>The thin voice starts, "This is only for communication.  We still have unfinished business, wizard."</p><p></p><p>Shi'Veilan nods, then says, "Unroll it for me, Lumao.  I can read it if you hold it for me."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He nods and obliges, a misty sadness now coming over his eyes. This was not right. It shouldn’t have been like this, here, underground. Nevertheless, who knows when he might have the chance ever again. For Bahamut’s sake, he may not live to tell the tale of this very place at all!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Upon thinking of Bahamut, there is a shiver in the tree.  It seems to be bolstered, at least momentarily.  There is an intake of breath, but it does not come from Shi'Veilan.  </p><p></p><p>The dark man on the other side reads, nodding.  After a time, he looks up to Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>"Have you read this, brother?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I have not, tempted though I admittedly may have been, I respected....our father’s wishes.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a distinct impression Shi'Veilan knew Mao hadn't read the scroll yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Would that things could have been different Shi’Veilan. Our father, for better or worse, follows his heart above all. Would that I could have known you sooner, but alack, some things are not meant to be. </p><p></p><p>As to the meaning of your summoning, it seems the Pale Prince is keener to pull strings than to face things. His heart, lost to the frost, the kindling flame no longer alight within the recesses of his spirit. What part you play in all of this is anyone’s guess, but I mean to see this through. Perhaps it is best that this happened now, before...</p><p></p><p>...sigh...</p><p></p><p>Alack.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't play any part in it.  Whatever happened in the past is the past.  For now at least.  If I am able to put the events in the right order, however, you're after the dragon mark.  Father told you it was our lineage.  And since there was no word of a mad mage gallivanting around with the mark, he thought I failed?  Or had he known from the start it was a fool's errand?  Either way, it seems he's convinced you, for blood or glory, to do what he would not.  Have you realized the truth yet, Lumao?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"A wise fool once told me that we are all pawns in the game of life. Perhaps that is so. What motivation would you give me otherwise to bestill the words of the man that I know?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Words are meaningless - I would urge you to judge with your eyes.  What have you <i>seen</i> of your father so far, hmm?  Told you of his existence well into your life, only to set you on a path he would not dare tread?  Inform you of a history, a family you've never known only to rip it all away from you the next second?  You're not the first he's done this to, and you will not be the last.  He is the basest form of evil - a truly selfish man without compulsion to be better.   Yet he would dangle his 'legacy' over other's heads as a treasure, only to lead them down a primrose path.  </p><p></p><p>"No, I would not give you motivation based on words, lies, Lumao.  I would instead have you see what end your father has brought you to.  There are but two ways out of this tower - one is death; the other is owing the Pale Prince.  Either are shackles, and there is no boon to gather.  All is villainy and woe.  This was set from the start.  You and I were but a sacrifice, an offering from our dear father.  I only hope, one day, that I can repay his favor."</p></div>
