strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The group does as you say, lining up against the wall.  (Mechanics - group strength checks for everyone to get up and over, then to pull the dragonborn up.  Soo...)</p><p></p><p>The gnome gets up on everyone easily enough.  The halfling is nimble enough to get up on the wall without too much aid as well.  The dwarf, however...  is a bit heftier!  </p><p>(First strength check is for the dwarf getting pulled/pushed up the humanoid stairs.  3 rolls, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone strains and tries as much as they possibly can, but nobody can lift the dwarf.  You see that, after a certain number of tries, the people fade away.  A few moments later, they reappear, huddled in a circle, discussing how to get over the wall.  The halfling notices you, comes over and says, "Hey mister..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue chuckles to himself, “Alright, let’s see here...” He takes a closer look at the construction of the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's just a wall.  Too tall for a single person to get over, but just a standard stone wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Normal soil.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us see, do you lot remember me from before?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets blank stares.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right then...Master dwarf, how high can you jump?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps and gets about a foot off the ground.  Then shrugs, comically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right...this will take a little time, but we'll get it sorted out."</p><p>[Rest to prepare a spell?]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You all, take some time to acquaint yourselves with these whilst I meditate."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's start with you master dwarf. Put these boots on..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll try this way first."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So...let's see that jump again!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the boots and the spell, the dwarf jumps straight up to the wall and lands...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Somewhat gracefully at the top.  His left boot hits the edge, he slips... but catches himself at the last to kneel firmly on the top of the wall.  He reaches down and starts helping the others up again.  Soon it comes down to the human and the dragonborn.  (Plan for getting them over?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok now, lets pass those boots down!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The human takes a running jump, but can't get the depth down and crashes into the fall, falling over.  The dragonborn ups just fine, putting his hand down for the human.  The human stands, shakes itself off, and tries again...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The human jumps, but the boots are tied together, and he trips again.  The dwarf misses him, but the dragonborn grabs his arm and pulls him up.  (Maouelue's turn!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a hefty <i>sproing</i>, the metal mage makes it to the very edge of the top of the wall.  The dwarf stabilizes him and the group now looks out over yet another vast field of blackness.  The world seemingly ends here.  One by one, the people jump down into the blackness and disappear.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well blimey... what an odd sort of place this is..." He looks behind himself again, back down the grassy side to regain his bearings.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"All I gotta do is juuuuuuuuuuuuuuump!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard jumps into  the void.  As the blackness envelopes him, it morphs and he feels himself floating through space.  A hazy blueness starts as a pinpoint of light, widens out to encompass his vision entirely, then focuses into the large block of ice with the person inside.  The giant elk nudges the newly re-appeared man, while the boots Maouelue had lent to the small group are waiting for him atop the cold block in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sounds of dripping can be heard from somewhere in the corridors connected to this room, echoing off the frosted walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well Elkamigo...I dropped off that great wall, came unglued, fell into a deep well, and landed to reform here, <i>and</i> I took care of my shoes! Not bad for a moment's end I'd say!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I see... you're just staring at your walls..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But hark! Do I hear echoing footfalls? Or is that just the mire of the cavern? Let me sling up my baskets and we'll ride back down the line."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Elkamigo chortles something sounding suspiciously like "Do what you gotta jiboo."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Elkamigo look S towards the rooms opening, but nothing presents itself with the exception of the echoing dripping.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They ride South and Mao pulls the reigns up just as they start, thinking to take a closer look at these suits of armor.</p></div>
