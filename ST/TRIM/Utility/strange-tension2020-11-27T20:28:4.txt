The toil does help loosen the armor and un-ice the rest of what's on the body.  (Investigation checks for the black knight, the 'veteran' and the others at large.  Oh, and if there's anything else you wanted to pick over, feel free!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight has plate armor, painted black with an insignia just poking out from behind a scratch the damage left in it.  He carried a great-sword, a heavy crossbow, and a dagger, all standard.  The necklace on around his neck held a blue crystal, but it is now cracked down the center and has completely lost it's luster.  Lastly, he carries the same parchment the others had on them, a few in fact, concerning the wayward druid and mage from Oakhust.</p><p>(Arcana check for the necklace, history check for the partial insignia.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The veteran has splint armor that is actually very well maintained.  Standard armor, no +.  He also carried a long sword, a couple short swords, and a couple daggers, again standard.  He had two greater potions of healing and one standard potion of healing.  He also had a hand drawn map of both the barrow site, and a scrawled map of another area, this one unfamiliar to the both of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deep in an inside pocket of his coat, you find two interesting items.  The first is a ring with a marvelous ruby inset.  But then you look, and it's a bright amber color.  When you look closer, swirls of yellow and flecks of black can be seen in tumult within the gem.  It looks like lava made into a gem.  (Arcana for identification, or short/long rest to attune.)  The other is a small carved mink, made from what seems to be a pliable bone-like material.  The minks eyes are very lifelike and sparkle in the dawn's light, which is just coming up over the horizon.  (Perception for your surroundings now that it's lighter outside.  Investigation on the scrimshaw mink for info on that.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As you both pick through the rest of the thugs, you find serviceable maces, all in various states of disrepair.  A few light and heavy crossbows and a bevy of bolts.  All in all, including the knight and the vet, you found 250 gold, 700 silver.  (Anything else you were looking for specifically?)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue looks around to see smoke from doused fires rising to the sky.  The din sounds like a camp breaking down and moving.  To the S, a stream runs SE, and there looks to me a small bridge to cross farther downstream.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Frenchy go through the rest of the remains grabbing what they could find. They pick up the net and some of the stray platinum balls from Maouelue's triple triumvirate. They also take a moment to pick up Dieter's spare shuriken that he hadn't had time to take.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>It takes a bit of scouring but (with a great perception roll) Maouelue is able to spot a higher outcropping.  Unfortunately, two things might be wrong with it.  Firstly, it's across a rickety bridge.  Second, there looks to be something on the ridge already.  Other than that, there are a variety of trees around.  Not a forest, per se, but with Frenchy there, Maouelue would feel relatively safe to get his reverie in.</p></div>
