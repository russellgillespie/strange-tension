strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>He chuckles.  "Although, our youngest wouldn't have you believe it.  Wilm always coveted our father's power and influence.  He was always searching after the next legacy for the Muhlen name.  Problem is, this gift or curse or whatever-the-hell it is that our family has...  it doesn't exactly follow a pattern.  The eldest heir doesn't always get it.  Nor does the most sane.  I actually received it fairly young.  And I tried to give it back, I tried to rectify the fucking situation.  But all to naught, as it seems.  Never found the Giant's lands, never really even crossed the Trackless Sea.  Got stranded out on an island, pirates picked me up.  To get away, I told them..." He starts laughing in earnest, now, "Told 'em that I could turn silver to gold!  Told them I could increase their coffers with a single mark!!  They had me prove it, and they let me live.  Pieces of shite, they all were.  Dropped me in the middle of Luskan for dead.  Well...  well, you wanted to hear my history.  That's just some of the sordid details.  What else did this vision tell you?  Am I getting it all right so far?"  He leans against a wall and slides down to sitting, head in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Heh, and there we have it at last. Don’t worry Fru– Jaecob, we all have our demons, our skeletons in the sea. The truth will heal in all this and now it is my turn. Alezander...that was your father’s name, yes? It was he I met in the light-of-the-dark. He told me of the secret family history. He railed against the illithid usurpers that have taken this hold. And lastly he...he implored me to set him free...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume/Jaecob immediately looks up at you, fear straining his face as you say this last.  "Aye, that was my father's name.  And if he was fighting ill-thids, or whatever you said, so be it.  He can rot in Nessus for all I care, good riddance.  Whatever he <i>implored</i> you to do, though, forget about it.  He has a sweet tongue and a black heart.  Let it lie, friend.  Let's just concentrate on getting the hell outta this place.  Then, maybe, we can see to stopping my ignoble brother in his insane notion of 'conquering the world', aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, a silver tongue indeed he has, but not so easily are his deeds swept away into forgiveness. Even as he would seem to offer me aid in this endeavor, never an altruistic motive did I perceive. However, perhaps this new understanding gives you an opportunity for a greater redemption. These beast appear to have his soul captive, draining it for power and secrets. Mayhaps you could be the one to give him his final end? After all, the old scars don’t seem to have fully healed, let alone that new one he just opened in your mind. I won’t implore you, but if we are to survive this, we must speak plainly and true. What do you say?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"One in my mind...?"  Jaecob looks scared and his eyes go unfocused as he tries to reason this new bit of information.  Finally he says, "Aye, you're right.  I'm sorry, Dieter.  For my dishonesty and for my lack of courage.  I'll follow your lead on this, of course.  And if there be redemption here for any of us, let us find it, if only to go back to our families with heads held high."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Time for you to be rid of the ripples of this curse my good man, for you have suffered greatly and it seems little of it is of your doing. I accept your apology and I am sorry to have plumbed the depths of your spirit so, but it would seem, my hand was forced...as it so often has been these days. Come Jaecob, or Frume if you still prefer. We must all wear the name we choose even if we cannot run from that which we are given.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sidles up next to the melancholy man and gestures to the door. “It is time to move on, friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Svankigare...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles, getting up from his sitting position.  "Thought it was a nice name, <i>Frumious Bandersnatch</i>!  Got it from a book in my father's study."  He laughs, in remembrance.</p><p></p><p>The word is uttered and stone grinds, the south door swinging open towards the two adventurers.  Beyond is a dimly lit room, the light a pinkish-purple, throbbing to an imaginary beat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the men enter, a strange feeling comes over them.  (Wisdom save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A small pain, barely enough to register as a pain, arcs through their minds upon entering  (1 damage!  Smh.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sprawling room has a caved wall in the SW corner of the room, a strange stone door sits on a pedestal of sorts, with no form of handle again.  There is a small set of stairs on the E wall raising up to a offset room.  There are several tattered tents or makeshift shelters throughout.  All appear to be empty, at least from a cursory glance.  The pink-purple light is emanating from small braziers all over, at base of all of the walls.  There looks to be something inside the braziers, giving of the strobing glow.  They are not all in sync, however, making you feel a slight bit off balance.  Lastly, the duo notice standard wooden doors to the S and W, aside from to door in the curved wall jutting out.  (Perception or investiagtion on anything you want, just let me know what you're looking for/at!)...(and Roll20 is updated, too.)</p></div>
