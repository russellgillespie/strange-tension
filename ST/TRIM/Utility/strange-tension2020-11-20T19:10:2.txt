<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, thinking fast, pulls out and throws the net of invisibility over Maouelue and the prone woman, then begins to tiptoe around the edge of the room toward the wall from which they heard the yells.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter knows from Maouelue there are four coming, but he doesn't know from where.  Maouelue can see one silhouette peeking through the broken stone window on the N side of the building.  Dieter knows someone is there, too, just hasn't seen them yet.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter peeks out and almost bumps into the man peering through the broken window.  He's flanked by three more burly men, looking for other breaks or entrances into the building, all coming from the N side.  (With a 17) Dieter can also see the circle of runes tattooed on their clothing, signifying the Runemark.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter can’t resist. He pulls up both his blades and sticks them right through the crack in the window into the man’s eyes, one blade a piece. As he does, he whispers,</i></p><p></p><p>"I know you, your whole crew, are dead men.  Dead.  Men."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter appears in the window in front of the man, and the thug yells in fear and disbelief.  The second before Dieter stabs his eyes out and ruins this man, there is recognition there.  There is realization there.  There is disbelief there.  He barely has a moment to remember where her had heard those words before the swords enter his brain and cease his life.</p></div>
