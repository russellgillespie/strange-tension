strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco did not bring the sphere back.  (That doesn't mean he didn't find it, however...)</p><p>Dieter reads through the book, really taking his time to try and decipher the writing.  After a handful of pages, he can definitely tell this was Lord Muhlen's.  It looks like the wizard was trying to piece together the language of the illithids, known as Qualith.  The writing is more of a textural representation of emotions and larger concepts than actual words specifically.  Lord Muhlen notes that humanoids are not able to read Qualith, or else they could go mad.  Needless to say, the last few pages were his tests into deciphering the code to the cryptex.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes the items in hand and looks over the cryptex once more, now taking in all the shapes. He retreats toward the door and attempts to close it with a word. He then beckons Flayco over and tries to get him to settle. He has a mind to sit down and meditate on these writings for awhile before he takes it a step further...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter lays his hands on Jaecob.  A golden glow, tinged with a little aquamarine blue, surrounds the two.  The glow abates, and Jaecob slooowly opens his eyes.  He blinks;  Looks around.  Sees Flayco on the ground, trying to get up on Shelli.  The baby dragon sits back down and scratches the back of its head with a hind leg.  It then tries to hop back onto Shelli, still trying to get up.  Jaecob's eyes go <i>very</i> wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Jaecob! You’re awake! Fear not...this is <i>Flayco</i>. He’s one of us now. I’ll explain more later. Here, take this...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He offers up the last bottle of Golden Dragon Ale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here, I saved the last for you.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He accepts the bottle but cannot take his eyes, his <i>wide</i> eyes, away from the monster on the ground.</p><p>"Fa... fa....  F....    Flayco, ye say?"  He paused a beat, taking it all in.  "Nice name, that."  He looks towards Dieter.  </p><p>"What in the fucking Nine Hells did I miss?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well, you...kind of...blacked out. That chest in the last chamber was an ooze monster which we laid low, and the golden egg there, well...it turns out it was Flayco. </p><p></p><p>I’m sorry, this must all seem a bad dream, and believe me, I’m on the verge myself, but, I could not leave a whelp uncared for. What with the dread power hunger of your father, along with his spirit’s captivity at the hands of the illithids and your usurper brother, I feel we must do everything in our power to resist! </p><p></p><p>It would seem this poor creature was bred for one purpose. I plan to undo that. I will take what energies our foes have pooled and whirl them back one-hundred fold with the wrath of scorned, the enmity of the exiled! </p><p></p><p>Just think...you, me, poor Shelli, and indeed perhaps most of all wretched Flayco here are castaways. Bastards of circumstance. Our stories have been writ by the hands who misunderstand, the hands who manipulate our very life essences to their whims. </p><p></p><p>I tell you all, right here, right now, <i>I will not let this stand!</i> Join with me, Jaecob! Slide with me Shelli! Flock with me Flayco! We will undo our would be undoers to their abominable doom!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Somewhere in the back of Dieter's mind, he feels the pull of his friend Maouelue.  He imagines his friend giving the same kind of speech, wherever he might be.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob shakes his head to clear it.  "Ab...absolutely!  You know we're behind you!  Let's get things done and get to some sunshine, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Two alms to that <i>brother</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen slips off the back of the giant snail shell.  Stretching his back and muscles, he looks around the room.  "Where are we?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The Sunless Citadel...”, Dieter almost <i>spits</i> the words as he hisses his derision for the labyrinthine fortress.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen does a double take, then goggles at the druid.  "The...  Did you just say we're in the Sunless Citadel?  <span style='color: black; background: black;'>Fucking bugger, he found it.</span>"  The last of his words fade into sibilant whispers, nearly unheard by Dieter.  Jaecob looks to Dieter. "We <i>have</i> to get out of this place, Dieter.  Besides my deranged brother's minions and the flayers, there are horrible abominations.  Like, from the Abysss abominations..."  He looks around, starting to get frantic.  His eyes alight on the illithi-dragon.  Softly, he whispers, "They could be anywhere."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter and Muhlen are talking, the druid hears a crackling, creaking sound from behind him.  Flayco is around the area you hear the noise coming from.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter spins around on the spot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last vestages of the dead tree are creeping up on your dragon/illithid/puppy.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to send a blast of flame over to the tree, but for some reason his spell fizzles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A branch reaches out and grabs onto the puppy-illithid, making it yelp.</p></div>
