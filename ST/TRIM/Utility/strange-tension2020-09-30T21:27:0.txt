<div class="character-1"><p>About a half hour into Maouelue's meditation, a group of bats flies by outside in the darkening dusk.  One of them breaks from the pack to glide into the edge of the cavern mouth.  It lands, upside down, right above the wizard.  It's eyes are open, however, and it's eyeing Dieter hungrily.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter side-eyes the bat</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat hisses at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sends his bat down the first hallway to inspect past the taper.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat flies down the hallway.  A couple of minutes later, it comes back.</p><p>(Animal handing check, with advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat lands above the wizard and, telepathically, relays what he saw.  There were two bedrolls, moth eaten and dusty.  Silver ore veins ran rampant through the far end of the tunnel.  The taper stops several feet in, good silver available there.  There is something strange, though, at the beginning of the narrowing.  Something...  empty.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You receive - "Walls too thick."</p><p>(Is Dieter at the mouth of the tunnel by chance?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>When the bat returns, Dieter casually, but obviously, wanders away from the bat and toward the taper.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter approaches the narrowing of the walls, the stairs off to the right become more and more evident.  The reason being is that Dieter now can hear snuffling and scratching coming from down that corridor.  The stairs go down at a very steep angle.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter continues down the staircase and calls back to Maouelue to follow. He uses his scimitar to brace himself down the steep stairs and Maouelue uses his quarterstaff to do the same.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>(No worries.)</p><p>These stairs are not meant for either set of feet as first Dieter then Maouelue stumble, then slip down the stairwell.  You don't take any damage, nor do you fall prone.  But you do alert the green-skinned creature currently bent over a human body, muttering to itself.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No longer muttering, however, as it turns around quickly to see you.  It snarls and, as it does so, releases the leash he's holding.  Two slavering dogs quickly pounce as the creature reaches for its weapon...</p></div>
