<div class="character-1"><p>"Only two buildings are fully intact from the burnings - the tavern and the shrine."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ilmater...I wonder what became of the healer.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't know that I ever saw what happened to her in all the craziness.  Just noticed the place was untouched.  Must have suffered enough, eh?"  He chuckles, somberly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell you what, though... if I get another round of healing, I might be able to walk through what's left with you, see what we're working with?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye Vam. All together now?” He looks at the other two healers in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>(Ma)ouelue lets their glamour flicker, eyeing the others in anticipation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Daran hover around the man, while Bellatrix kneels at his feet.  They all lay hands and a golden glow surrounds Vam.  As the glow fades, the two women helpers gasp as a whole and hale Vam stands amidst his co-horts.</p><p>He looks at his arms and body.  Then he removes the bandage from his face.  Scars are still there, creasing his dark brown skin.  And the eye is still cloudy, not fully healed.  Maybe it never will be.  But the man standing in front of Ouelue and Daran smiles.</p><p>"Now...  well, then."  Wetness lines the bottom of his eyes as he looks to his friends with pure thanks.  "Much obliged.  All of you.  Thank you."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Vam...I am only repaying a debt that was already owed. You helped me and my <i>missing</i> friend Dieter in a time of need. We formed an alliance that day, and <i>one that I aim to keep alive!</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Who here will swear fealty to the cause of righteousness and the pursuit of a new valor in these lands!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston steps forward, but then looks awkward.  "I... uh...  I will.  I don't have any weapons or anything.  Not sure how exactly to swear fealty.  But I'm with you guys!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As am I," says Vam, smiling at the young ranch-hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I believe your cause is just, wizard.  As long as you will have me by your sides, I will fight."  Bellatrix's eyes sheen over quickly with a green flash.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your will is all that is needed my good men and women, and...both...!" </p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray let us each ready ourselves for the next push at hand. We leave in two hours."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam motions to Heston, and they take their leave out the back doors.  Bellatrix goes back to the fire, meditating.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The elf's illusion fades as he sits there in the warmth of the ranch. He comes out of his short reverie and walks out the back door and over to the nearest paddock, seeing what has become of the animals under Vam's care.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He cast his gaze around for Vam as he strolls over the lands, hoping to have a private word.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lands are sparse now.  The rain has abated enough to show a muddy tract of land devoid of crops, a strange sight to be sure as last you saw it was flush and growing well.   Vam and Heston are in the barn's hayloft, you heard some muffled noises and talking.  There are couple horses, one of which you do recognize as the one Dieter took along on the start of the trek.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The elven reverie has tempered some of the flame that had run so hot at the past meeting and Maouelue pauses at the door to the barn and knocks on the doorframe deferentially.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I beg your pardon, friends."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I came to check on the horses. I see one of those you lent us has returned...what news of its mate?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam peeks his head down.  "Unfortunately only this one came back.  Heston's got something interesting up here, if you want to check it out.  Not sure what to make of it, but you might."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm sorry to hear that. A thousand apologies for the loss. She was a good steed for her part. We did not...intend to be underground so long..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue ascends into the hayloft to investigate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, don't worry about it," he offers you a hand up to the loft.  "Most of the horses we have here are wild, or were at one point.  Heston here is a wizard with calming them, tempering them for farm work.  Other things happening right now, though."</p></div>
