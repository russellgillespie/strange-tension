<div class="character-1"><p>It holds, but there is movement in the waters underneath the mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He sends Fammy down for a flying lap around the water as he takes a step back.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's bat flies out to scope the area.  It's not very big and the bat makes quick work of it.  It's definitely a magical water, as it's not frozen, however not much more can be gleaned.  As it's making a last pass, a tentacle shoots out of the liquid and snatches it out of the air, and brings it below the surface.  At that moment, Maouelue loses connection with his familiar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks at the water below with concern and sends a cursory ice blast down to roil its surface.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A freezing cold blast hits the surface - and is absorbed into the liquid.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúHmm...here we go again...‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out to the water with his feelings and begins to weave... </p><p>[Shape Water]</p><p></p><p>He takes a portion of the water below and forms it into a shroud of ice spikes hovering the surface below him as he walks across the bridge.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue reaches for the 'water', he finds he's unable to grasp it.  It feels like liquid to the touch, but he is unable to form it through magic or take away any in cupped hands.  His hands are completely dry when lifted out of the liquid, too.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An oily, grey tentacle tries to grab at the mage, but is unsuccessful.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves across for a closer look at the ice cube in the center.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Awesome!  How'd he do? ‚öΩ</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage resigns himself. </p><p>‚ÄúAlright...I guess I‚Äôll have to do this the old fashioned way...‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks down in the water to find a trace of the beast lurking within.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The eladrin longbow is drawn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pool is warm to the touch.  As Maouelue peers into the depths, fathoms appear before him.   It is impossibly deep, and, at the bottom, a massive beast circles the pool.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds feel like minutes as he watches the ominously graceful monster maneuver what for it is a small space.  Suddenly, red eyes, three stacked on top of each other, snap up towards the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It swims, cautiously, towards the surface.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The humongous creature hovers mere feet from Maouelue, red eyes darting hither and yon, not seeming to focus on anything.  Then, they snap forward, freezing the interloper where he is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Telepathically, it says to Maouelue, <i>"Am I not the most impressive, the most powerful and magnificent creature in all the worlds?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúYou are not.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúThat honor lies with the Platinum.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deep within your mind, hidden away for some time, you hear purring of an ancient dragon who is well pleased.</p><p>With the first word, the beast begins to open its mouth.  But with the second, it cocks its head and its body twists oddly.  With the last, it blinks.  Maouelue gets the feeling that, if it could smile, it would.  Then, it disappears from the liquid, fading away into particles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúHmph...well then...<i>very impressive...</i>‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue raises from the pool, Bellatrix touches him on the shoulder to make sure he's okay.  "Whatever you did, it must have worked.  The doorways all...  flashed.  Wouldn't have like to see what might have happened if we tried to go through without...   whatever it is you did."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúPraise Bahamut.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go left...‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trio move off back across the bridge and around the circle, heading for the northern-most exit.  A sharp right (N) turn leads the friends down a short flight of icy stairs and into a very large room.  At the far end of the room (in the W) stands another large brick of ice, the same dimensions as the other.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Mao once again raises a hand to the ladies and steps forward, what with being a...what was it again? Tenir? Maouleue couldn‚Äôt remember, but at any rate he <i>feels</i> like a chosen one.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans in close to the ice and inspects it all round.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao doffs his gauntlets and reaches out, touching faith.</p></div>
