strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>She wrings her hands, then takes a deep breath.  She places her hand on the mirror's surface.  The reflection fades to black, grey smoke swirls, coalesces.  Colors appear, render into shapes.  The forms take on the visage of Dieter and another man, very well known to Maouelue.  The man is sitting in a cell, looking at Dieter occasionally.  Dieter is unconscious in the bed next to him.  Another form can be seen hazily in a third bed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix, her hands on both sides of the mirror now, knuckles white, focuses her gaze more.  The picture recedes out of the door, up hallways, through walls.  It takes some time, but after a few beats, a citadel comes into view.  It's dark stairs lead to a spired set of towers, all decrepit and crumbling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the picture moves farther out, the darkness can be seen as the bottom of a chasm.  The chasm, or maybe a dark gorge, cuts a wide path.  As the mirror's picture continues to pan out, the gorge ends and an immense rock wall goes up, up, up, cresting at the rim of a crater, easing down into a caldera of a volcano.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Red drops hit the floor in front of the mirror.  Bellatrix sways as the grey mist comes back to the mirror.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bellatrix? My lady, are you unwell? What is it? What has happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She swoons, slipping to the ground.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue puts a hand on the witch's shoulder, but she slumps away.  Vam and Daran catch her before she hits the ground.  They bring her to a ramshackle couch and lie her down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood is running from each nostril in small rivulets, her eyes flutter.  Her mouth is moving, but there is no sound coming out.   (Medicine check for more info!)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The mage begins to perform a few preliminary clerical ministrations to determine Trix’s condition.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She doesn't seem to be in any pain.  She's more than likely highly exerted herself from the scry.  It doesn't typically happen, but there are occasions where this might occur.  Normal healing should help her.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are a few more stoppered potions of healing on her herbalism table.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue moves to take a potion of healing, then unstoppers it and dabs a few drops around Bellatrix’s lips, then pours a cursory few drops down her gullet.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blood dries and Bellatrix comes to, groggily.  "I'm...  sorry.  The larger view must have taken more out of me than I imagined.  Did any of you recognize the area?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, Vam, and Maouelue all nod their heads.  Heston and Bellatrix look at each expectantly.  Vam clears his throat and begins, "Uh...  It might be kinda tough to get to him, unless anyone else knows more about it.  I saw Mount Hotenow, and the gorge that peels off to the East is where the tower-thing is.  All I can think of - and mind you, this is just a terror-tale to scare kids - it that the place we saw was the Sunless Citadel."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston gives a low whistle and slumps back in a chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, somberly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks from one to the other. He has been underground enough to know what fel things reside in the sunless places of these parts. </p><p>“Please Vam, go on. I think, under the circumstances, that no ‘terror-tale’ would be too unbelievable. I saw one of those madmen with mine own eyes animating an abomination. Oh there are dark magicks indeed at work here.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ayuh," he starts, tilting his hat back and looking grave.  "Legend says there is a dragon that keeps the fires of Mount Hotenow going.  An ancient red dragon, who constantly bathes in the blood of the world..  One day, a conqueror built a tower along the river flowing past the volcano.  The conqueror had heard the rumors and dug straight down into the land to make a path underneath Hotenow so as to directly confront the dragon.  A massive eruption took place after this path was made, and the wonderous tower the conqueror had constructed slid into the rift, never to be seen again.  Crazy story, huh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Crazy....You mean to say the Citadel fell <i>into</i> the breach?... Dieter and I found a vast crevasse underground just before...just...”, He stifles a croaky breath. “...Just before he was taken.” The memory of building the forge, the weight of his armor relieved, the shared sweat and laughs and discovery of the joys of making...it all washes over Maouelue like a beam of starlight refracting off his sword into a million colors, blinding him with chromatic grief. </p><p></p><p>“Yes...he is there. I know it in my heart. Daran, do you remember where you found me?”</p></div>
