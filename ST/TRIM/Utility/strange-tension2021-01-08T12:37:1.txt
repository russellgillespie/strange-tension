strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The flames retract back to the beast, searing it again.  Although the monstrosity is massive, it seems very dexterous and avoids a good amount of the damage.  The mouths, eyes, ooze is getting closer.  It moves within 30 feet of the group now.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Taking it's extended dash action, it will move another 20 feet, just to the mouth of the pit.  Everyone can now see the disgusting sight of the creature.  It appears bodies of drow, illithid, and a myriad of other denizens of the underdark were boiled down and reassembled, poorly, into a mass of flesh, muscles, and viscous liquid.  The thing roils around, but seems to have appendages it can manifest at will.  Constant chattering and gibbering come from it, causing all of the party to get confused, the voices rattling around in your heads.  As it gets closer, you all can see the stone of the pit is quickly turning soft, mushy.  </p><p>(Mechanics - Wisdom save at the start of each turn, DC 10.  If you fail, roll a d8.  The floor around the creature in a 10ft radius is difficult terrain, which covers everybody at this time - with the exception of maybe Shelli.  To move, strength check, DC 10.  On a fail, movement is zero.  I'll update Roll20 asap.  Morning!!!  And welcome to HELL!!!! ðŸ˜†)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, his rage having dwindled in the interim while he assisted with the Annulus, breathes heavily, wiping streams of sweat from his once-again furrowed brow. The tingling of iron on his tongue still fresh from the bloodlust. He lunges at the grotesque giant and slashes deeply with his sword!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"Back to hell! Bugger off you filth!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He darts back 20 toward the dais while the creature is stunned.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco spews forth a great stream of acid into the many muddled faces of the grotesque blob, then preens as he looks up at Dieter adoringly, a mass of slimy tentacles and wings flapping about excitedly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco also flutters back to the outer ring of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Effect Magic Stones removed from BL1.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The decisive Druid directs the flaming sphere back up into the stunned assailant.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter continues pummeling the fiend with fire, he leaves the flaming sphere lingering on top of it. The light provides a bit more of a look into what the goo is and he takes a fleeting moment to inspect before following suit and bolting to the edge of the room.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Is it possible for a Flail Snail to dance? One wouldn't think so, but Shelli bobs up and down with an impish excitement as she approaches her incapacitated prey and begins lashing out with her stalks.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The creature is getting brutally beaten, fried, and...  hopefully there's no oven or skillet nearby.  It gets pushed 25ft away by Shelli's attack.  (Go ahead and roll a sphere attack, too.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob leaps toward the charred, battered, and slightly disintegrated morass of detritus.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He wipes a bit of sinew off his lips that results from his series of searing strikes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco hops and slaps and suck and "RRRAAAAAAAWWWWWK!!!"s his way over to its favorite new ragdoll.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Daddy Druid's heart swells with pride as his clutch performs his will above all expectation. Not to disappoint his buoyant brood, he sends more fireworks at the pitiful creature, now sagging low in the corner, a disgusting reek pouring out in smoke and sinew.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Fire has nearly immolated the monster.  Melted flesh, bone, and ichor slough off the being in waves, making the place stink like a garbage fire.  On top of that, the voices are now rebounding around the room, making it even harder to concentrate on the task at hand - putting this thing out of it's clearly miserable existence.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The many eyes look back and forth between the party members.   Several mouths gape, some scream, some cry.  Some melt off in slow agony.  The thing tries to straighten itself out, towering over Jaecob.  Several mouths lick grotesque lips.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(The way I'm reading it, any creature within the range has to make a wis save - maybe we skipped over that for the rest of the party, but a bunch of people standing around does not a combat make!</p></div>
