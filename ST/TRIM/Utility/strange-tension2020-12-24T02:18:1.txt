The snakes tunnels in Oakhurst, the Muhlen vault, the abyssal ravine... <i>That’s</i> how they’ve remained unseen. <i>That’s</i> how they are moving in the shadows. Sunless indeed. If this is the case...pray, perhaps we should reconsider our apprehension of the matter...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Perhaps...we needn’t stray so far afield after all. Perhaps we have all we need right here. Stay awhile and listen...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They lean in to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage solemnly doffs The Frostbitten Helm and places it on the floor. Next he silently slings the Shield of Disruption off his back and places it to the right and under the Helm. The Sword of the Mists and its scabbard come next, and now the outline of a warrior is beginning to take form. The Giantess Bracers come next and the elven wizard rubs at his wrists as they do, the skin puffy and pale with long suppression. Having donned the splint previously for ease of movement and discretion of sound, he goes over to his Bag of Holding™️ and pulls out the previously animated plate mail from Mulhen’s vault and places it in the center of the form. Lastly, he pulls out a serpentine amulet and a tattered book, <i>The Barbarian’s Wind</i>. These he places directly in front of Bellatrix and his eyes, who have been pointedly focused on the assembly until this point, meet hers in a somber stare.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here lie the relics of Lord Muhlen. He kept more than secrets in those halls. The Vault we found was surrounded by undead and grave warnings. Here lie the heirloom treasures of his delving. He sought deep, deep beneath even the lowest foundation of his haunt. The trap leading below the vault carried us into vast caverns of mystery. The book you see here was a gift, you see... A relic left to his <i>worthiest</i> of offspring, his...’dearest daughter.’ </p><p></p><p>As fate would have it, we met the man you saw there...”, He points to the scrying lens, “...in the mirror. That man gave us aid in the direst of circumstance. He saved and healed us when all else would have failed. With us, he traveled deeper intro the tunnels, showing us the way to many curiosities. <i>He seemed to know the tunnels in a way.</i> Frumious, or Frume as he would have us call him, led us to the first of many serpentine artifacts we would find down there. Altars and reliefs of ancient Naga rituals, dark sacrifice, a multi-headed dragon laying waste a continent...</p><p></p><p>As it turns out, some waste was laid on our behalf as well. You see, the serpents...well, three of them stood in this very room the last time we met. Three that have been lain low by our hands. Mine, Dieter’s, Frume’s and...” He stops a moment to consider the curiosity of the mirror men, the Henchys. Just how did they fit into all this? Should he even mention them? “...and some...I’m not quite sure how to explain it, but some magical-summonings-cum-acquaintances-cum-cohort? You see we found this mirror back when we first went seeking Douglas....” Maouleue takes a beat and surveys his audience. “...ah, never mind all that. Suffice it to say the Muhlen sisters <i>and their brother</i> are no more. Just how they tie into the Runmark’s machinations though, I am not yet sure. Please, friends of the light, understand this one last thing, the very place we finally surfaced was right atop a bottomless chasm underground.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It would seem where once we were saved by the light, we may now need descend into darkness in order to restore balance to these lands and to the lives of all who tread near this corruption.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Eyes go wide.  Looks pass between everyone.  They look to the items, then Maouelue, then each other.  All in silence.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, Vam breaks the quiet, saying, "Now, wait a minute.  If you're saying this citadel...  you've possibly been in?  Or near?  Then...  the rest could be true, too?"   He scratches his stubble.  "And what about the Runemark's forces?  If they're using that thing as a base of operations or something, well...  what else could they be harboring down in the depths?  We might have a difficult time taking down a human army.  But what if...?"  His voice fades as the possibilities surround the group.</p></div>
