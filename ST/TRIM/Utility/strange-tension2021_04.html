<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue preens.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Somewhere in a far off dungeon, Dieter broods...with his brood.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The cold, bedraggled crew carries on down the West offshoot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group makes it's way farther down the passages, farther seemingly <i>into</i> a complex of sorts.  The walls are contoured and sculpted, with patterns and pictures scattered throughout.  As the foursome enter into the passage, a rancid stench greets their nose.  Another long hallway opens in front of them, with a passage and broad stairs on their right (N), another broad passage to the left (S), and a crumbling wall revealing a purplish glow in front of them, 35 feet away (W).</p><p></p><p>Atop the stairs to the North, a small creature is floating above the stone floor...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Mree...  mree mree...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What curious oddity is this?" Maouelue exclaims. It appears fascinated by its own hands! Granted, If I had quite so many, I'd be fascinated as well." He casts a glance at Bella, concealing a wry smile.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Wafts of reeking green gas float around the flumph and drift towards the party.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Worried more about the expanding gas than the creature, the group doesn't get a great read on it's intentions.  However, it doesn't seem aggressive at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's steer clear of that one for the moment," the Metal Mage offers, "We'll scout around a bit first. Could this be the underbelly of the Fortress? That would be astonishing...yet somewhat intentional. Ah the whims of the Source are hard to fathom at time. I remember how Shi'Vandos used to go on at length about the mysterious weave of time and energy that constitute the Planes we inhabit. He would speak to me of deep, untraceable connections between different times and spaces. Ah, how I wonder what he might say could he be here right now." </p><p>The mage's musing turn to soliloquy as the power of this place mingles with his memories.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage comes to as if from a daydream of his ancestors. </p><p></p><p><i>Albrek...</i></p><p></p><p>He leads on West down the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue leads his companions past the curious flumph and into the Western corridor.  The hall would normally have ended in a solid stone wall, however there is now a decent sized hole in the Northern wall through which the party sees more purple and yellow mushrooms.  Their glow gives the room an eerie, almost ominous presence.  As Maouelue looks into the room, to the South a hard scraping and low growl can be heard.  And felt, as the bass resonance shakes the walls and floors, rattling their bones.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A word whispered in Sylvan sends Maouelue's familiar ahead to scout the birds eye view of the disturbance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bird takes it's time flying to a few different areas.  First, the bird tracks North, through the purple mushroom area into another wide stone room, looking like an entrance room.  Farther north it views a large space with four wide columns holding up the weight of the mountain.   A room juts to the East from here, bringing the bird back, first, to the pool the group was dropped in then back to the purple mushroom room.  Heading back to the 'Entrance Hall', the bird then takes a small passage west, which expands to a hallway to the S.  Two doors on the E walls and a door at the end of the southward hall bar the birds path further.  </p><p></p><p>The bird returns to the group, then flits south, into another small entrance way, and then into a molten furnace of a lava flow.  A few beings splash around in the flow, but the bird is able to stay well above the heat and find a separate, return passage back to the party.  (Roll20 is updated, too!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>I guess the first point of investigation</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Damn!!)  </p><p>The coast looks pretty clear.  Nothing moving, no sounds save for the dripping of water to the W and the rush of those drainage tunnels to the E.  There is a fallen door on the S side of the room, but it was knocked down ages ago, most of it is splinters now.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a lot of rubble around, but of the stone you can see, there are what look like draconic runes etched in random places on the walls, ceiling, and floor.  Nothing that is cohesive or makes sense to any of you, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a few moments to make some rubbings of the runes in his book before leading the party on down the hall. (Toward the second smaller circle)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a 30ft by 30ft more draconic etchings line the wall, most are prominent near and on the massive bronze door leading W.  There is also a large bronze door going S.  Both look locked and, again, <i>massive</i>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue reaches out with his feelings....</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Both have heavy abjuration (warding) magics surrounding them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Can anyone read any of this? It all appears to be magically sealed."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix and Benna come forward, inspecting the doors.  Daran looks on from afar but mainly walks around the room, every once in a while he will reach out and trace a draconic mark.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran makes his way over after a few minutes, the women whispering back and forth to each other.  </p><p></p><p>"Maouelue, a word?  I've been looking at these marks on the walls.  They continue through the caverns here, and are heaviest on the western door.  Now, I'm not a scholar... but these don't look like letters.  They're too random.  They look like...  scratches.  As if...  Well, it's almost as if some creature, maybe even a dragon, was housed here and forced through that doorway."  He points W.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A cold shiver runs down the mage's spine, chilling even beyond his inner frost. "A Dragon? Here?" Maouelue considers a moment, apparently lost deep in thought. "My friends, I must meditate on this. Let us set our camp here for awhile and secure our position.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the team sets up the perimeter, Maouelue takes his helm in hand and assumes a lotus pose, his hands channeling through the Frostbitten Helm. He reaches out to his patron, searching for the spirit of the dragon.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue reaches out with his arcana, his sense is able to pass around the area, even showing him an alternative route around the S door.  When he attempts to search past the W door, however, he is gently rebuffed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The wizard gets up abruptly and moves back down the East corridor to inspect the broken door pieces in the next room. He tries to make out how it had been mounted and how it might have fallen.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A blue-white light courses through the metal mage's mass of flowing locks revealed by his doffed helm. The hairs seem to fairly float and become translucent in the cavern mist.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aefir Nightseeker was instantly recognizable to Maouelue.  He is a myth, a legendary elven figure.  He was said to be the right hand of Corellon Larethian, progenitor of the entire elven race.   He was golden in hue, from head to toe, and was said to be the father of the Summer Eladrin, where they got their coloring from.  Hundreds of thousands of stories are told of his conquests and vanquishing of foes.  A couple of the most famous are his Five Trials, also known as the Trials of Aefir, where he searched and found the 'Eye of Darkness'.  Another that immediately comes to Maouelue is the story of the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil.  It is said Aefir conquered it single-handedly and locked it away underneath a mountain.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Mhaor’isel Ghaatiil... Could it really be?</i></p><p></p><p>A thrill of apprehension and starlight seem to both invigorate and rivet the mage on the spot. What could have led him here at this moment? The strings of lore  tug at the very sinews of Maouelue’s body as he moves back to the group. </p><p></p><p>“We must tread carefully here. While my heart yearns to see and connect to the draconian mysteries here, my head pushes, may, pulls me away. Let us go around here to the South, through the mushroom Room. The Mush Room. The Shh Room. Let us be very very quiet...”</p><p></p><p><i>The mage’s voice reverberates to a halt among the silent cohort.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna and Bellatrix look relieved, they weren't able to get very far with the door's magic.  Daran look pensive.  All gather their things and follow Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the group travels back to the entrance hall, they can see the other door they were opposite of to the N of them.  Over time, the mushrooms toxicity must have eaten away the stone enough to allow for passages through this underground edifice.  The remaining hallway curves around to the S, and the group take the passage until they come to a choice.  Three doors are before them.  One right in front of the group, on the E wall, another one farther S on the same wall, then the hall ends in another door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They take a listen at the near door and Maouelue tests its lock.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are a couple spells that could open or suppress the lock, but their names are eluding you.  You can try to break it down, but the magic makes the door stronger, thus tougher to break.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bahamut, be my guide!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Blast...This is where my faith and devotion leave me. Cold, ensconced at the bottom of a frozen mountain!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue picks up the Mace of Reduction and whispers a few words to it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>"Don't fail me like last time now...."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Wham!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He smashes the mace against the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue swings the mace towards the door, but before it hits, a pink glow surrounds the door and stops the weapon from touching it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Belllatrix asks, "What's happening?  Can we help?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna meanders over to the door to check things out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm just trying to open this bloody door..."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But as you can see...."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It's warded..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women can't seem to figure out the door's secret either.  Bellatrix says, "I could throw a dispel magic at it, see if that works?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Please do m’lady”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She gives Maouelue a wry, flirty smile.  Then she raises her hands and closes her eyes.   Bowing her head, she recites some words in a strange dialect.  Blue sparks erupt from her rotating hands.  They mix and spark against the pink glow.  As the two colors grow brighter, they have their own battle against the door.  A sharp crackle, sizzle, then a pop of light sends both colors fading away.  All watch as the door knob turns slowly.  With a soft <i>click</i>, the door opens inward.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Darkness greets the foursome.  A small sound comes from the back of Bellatrix's throat and she retreats to the other side of the hallway, shaken.  Daran peeks around the corner of the doorway.  "Want me to head in first?  I can see pretty well in the dark."</p><p>(Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is dusty and dank, smelling of mildew and old rot.  A large pile of bones is piled up against the far wall.  Nothing stirs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue inspects what kind of bones they might be.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue enters the eerie room, followed close behind by Daran.  The women stay in the hall, Bellatrix peers through the doorway.  (Investigation check, with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage sifts through the slimy, mold-covered bones.  skulls, ribs, femurs, ulnas, a plethora of tarsals and metacarpals are heaped together.  After a few moments and careful study both Maouelue and Daran notice something...  shift.  A bone vibrates off to the side, close to the N wall.  Then two, three, four start to shiver and some start to move, connecting together.  The group hears the clicks and rattles of bones knitting themselves together until, in front of them stands...</p></div>

Daran, wherever he might be, is either dying or dead.  (He was at 0 hp.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The door cracks down the middle.  One more good knock'll do it all in. Maouelue sees something shiny through the crack.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace hits in the same place, showering the group in splinters.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’m....tired...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wood withers away under Benna's fingers, showing the group the inside of the room...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone walls sap the brilliance of the treasure trove on the floor.  A chest or two are in the room, as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Good lord...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One chest is overloaded with gems, smaller stones but worth about 10 gp each.  This chest is small, but contains 40 gems all told.  There are coins scattered throughout the room as well, totaling 800 gp.  (Another d100, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a solid golden table are two potions.  Inside one is what looks like smoke, writhing and twisting around.  The other hold an effervescent liquid, the bubbles rising to the top continually.  (Arcana check for these.  If you'd like to try a drop of the potion, you have advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A solid gold disc is affixed to the far wall, catching everyone's eye.  It looks like a coin, with the profile of a humanoid on it.  (History check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The panther raises his right paw in respect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first is a potion of gaseous form, enough for two people.  The other is a superior potion of healing.</p><p>The 'coin' on the wall depicts a fire giant, head wreathed in flames like Roman laurels.  The trio knows very well that giants are world renown for their rune mastery, some of which can be seen on the rim of the golden circle.  (Anyone speak Giant?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The panther is now standing on hindquarters, raising both fists in tacet approval.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage looks closer at the runes, and there seems to be another, thinner line of script written around a symbol of two dragons chasing one-another's tail.  The dragon symbol is in red against the gold background, and the ring around the symbol states, <i>Those with the dragon mark, a red dragon lineage, or fire giant heritage, place your hand upon the seal and open the gate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Uncertain, Maouelue hesitantly extends his hand, palm outward to the seal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing happens.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmph, worth a shot." He casts a glance around. "Any of you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Assuming there are empty gazes,) Maouelue takes a moment to do another rubbing taking the contours this seal down into his book. He looks one more time around the device for any other signs of concealment before leading the group down to the doorway at the end of the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women shake their heads as they gather up some of the treasures.</p><p>Upon exiting, the three notice a rotten stench coming from the end of the hallway, not altogether different than the flumph gave off.  A sickly yellow-green mist comes up from the bottom of the door., which stands a bit ajar already.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sends a blast of hot fire searing toward the doorway, standing at the edge of range.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the fire from his hands reach the methane gas, sparks ignite the smoke... and the room!</p><p>(Dex saving throws for everyone, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Bellatrix take 9 points of damage, Benna takes the full 19 as the flames incinerate the simple door and back-drafts straight to them.  As soon as the rush of fire passes, they hear a low laughter coming from inside the now very smokey room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh Benna! I suppose....I should have asked you all to stand back. Something about the deep places brings out my quixotic impetuousness."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You in there!," Maouelue's voice cracks a bit as he attempts a challenging tone, "Show yourself!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is shuffling from the room, as smoke continues to billow out.  The laughing turns to gruff growling and a metallic scraping can be heard just under the growling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A big booming rumble of a voice breaks the eerie silence, saying, "WHO'S THERE?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets his metallicomets spinning around him, like a fiercely charged atom, hoping stir the air and clarify the fog a bit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It is I, Lumao Albrek. I come solely in the pursuit of justice and peace."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix whispers, "Mao... are you <i>sure</i> about this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"DON'T KNOW NO...  MAYO.  GO AWAY."  The voice, although booming, sounds a bit forlorn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue steps forward into the smoke, comets a-swirling. "Though it may not seem it, we do not come to threaten. Tell us, who are you? What is your station here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I AM SNARR THE ONE-HANDED.  I HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED HERE FOR MANY YEARS.  THE WIZARD, HE TOOK MY HAND SO HE COULD TRAVEL, THEN LOCKED ME AWAY HERE FOR ETERNITY... JUST IN CASE HE NEEDED ANOTHER HAND."  (All of this has been in Giant, by the way.  The women would have no clue what or who you're talking to!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Tell me, O mighty SNARR, just who was this <i>wizard</i> of whom you speak. Tell me, and mayhaps we can be of service to <i>each other</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A shuffling then a huge <i>WHUMP</i> sounds on the other side of the doorway.  Smoke rushes and billows out past the heroes, clearing to see a humongous fire giant looking at them through the doorway.</p><p>"CAN YOU GET ME HAND BACK?  IT WAS THE BAD WIZARD.  CALLED HIMSELF SHIV THE DRAGON.  LAST I SAW HE CUT OFF ME HAND AND WENT THROUGH THIS DOOR."  He points to the doorway with his hand-less stump.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come then Snarr. There is something you need to see. Perhaps something that will find you <i>exactly</i> what you seek. Follow me."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers something a moment...</i></p><p></p><p>"...Unless you are in some way bound...?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I AM.  I'M TOO BIG TO FIT THROUGH THE DOOR." Maouelue can see it would be impossible to get him out through the door in between them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm...let me think a moment..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If you would let me do something...<i>a bit of a trust exercise</i>....I may just have an answer. How well do you feel at the moment?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"WELL...  THAT FIRE DIDN'T HURT, TICKLED REALLY, BUT...  I'M KINDA HUNGRY.  COULD USE SOME FOOD.  DRINK IF YE HAVE IT.  THEY DON'T FEED ME MUCH, I THINK THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"HOW'RE YOU?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah yes, I know we've got a bit here somewhere." He grabs a few rations from his pack. "Ah yes, here we go. It's not much, but hopefully it's a start!" He leans back a moment to fill the others in about the goings-on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The giant eats, eagerly.  (You made a friend!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"While you eat, friend, we will sit down the hall while the smoke clears, sorry about that by the way, and recover our strength. We'll need it for what comes next..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>[short rest/(Feywild LR)]</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Snarr offers for you to come into the vast room and eat with him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed, we will join you! Come Bella, come Benna!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he sees the women, he says, "OOOH, PRETTIES!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He waves with his good hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Alright, alright, keep your hand to yourself!" He smirks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks abashed and sits on his hand.  Bellatrix smiles at him, though, and that brightens him up.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok then Snarr, it looks like we’re about ready then. I just need to know one thing. Do you want to do the honors or me?” He pulls out the Mace of Reduction and proffers it. “All it will take is one <i>good</i> strike, and we should be in business.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"MAYBE WE CAN TAKE TURNS?  WHAT AM I HITTING?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well you see here Snarr, the thing is, this mace right here...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gestures again with the mace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...will cast a reduction spell on you if we get it <i>just</i> right.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“May I?...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ahh...not quite...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Eeesh, sorry about that. Maybe if you hold still I can get lined up just right...”</p><p>[adv?]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here let me ease this for you a bit.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There, does that help?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"YEP!  THANKS!"  He scratches his head with his stump.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The giant, in a sudden spasm, shrinks down to half his size, stunning the ladies who didn't know you could do that!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Snarr, surprised by seeing the small people get large, takes a few moments to re-orient himself.  </p><p>"Hmmm."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a time, he notices the door is significantly more...  available to proceed through, and smiles at Maouelue.</p><p>(Crits on a 19+)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Y’alright there sNARR? Here, take this.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That ought to help a little anyway. Now follow us!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He follows, mesmerized at finally leaving his prison.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’d say, ‘Smell the fresh air,’ but....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads the brief way down the hall and shows the seal to sNARR. “I think the answer to your questions lies here, friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I know not what will happen, but if we don’t see each other again, I wish you the best in  your search. Let the name Lumao “Maouelue” Albrek be known as a friend to the Giants.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With wide eyes, he enters the treasure room, gazing at the wondrous wealth and shiny things.  Then his gaze lands on the 'coin' on the wall, and his mouth falls open even farther.  As he moves towards the object, there is a low humming that starts.  Everyone looks around, but as Snarr gets closer to the 'coin', the humming quite obviously gets louder and louder.  As he reaches for it, puts his hands on it, the humming turns into a heartbeat, the now very loud <i>thrumm thrumm</i> echoing around the room and seemingly throughout the underground complex.  </p><p></p><p>Snarr's hands move around some of the runes, then he finds the dragon mark.  As his hand touches it, like molten gold melting away, the patina of the 'coin' falls away and a blast furnace of heat greets the adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s blue orbs shrivel a little.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“If I may....before you go...what is this place?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A long time ago, Zalto, the guy up there, split the fire giant ordning so's we couldn't come back to our home in the elemental plane of fire.  We'd been kicked out so long...  I'm not even sure there are any more of my kind over there.  But, anything is better than being here.  Thank you, Maouelue, friend o'the giants.  I will tell others of your great deeds."  He bows low to Maouelue and the women, then steps through the gate and, in reverse, the molten gold flows back up to re-seal the 'coin'.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The group lingers in the silence, in the space that for the first time in who knows how long, was no longer a prison. They move into the room vacated by Snarr gathering in their surroundings. Maouelue asks Benna to provide some light.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is the biggest space the group has seen so far.  Cracks in the floor reveal where the methane gas has been coming from.  Just below the floor seems to be a lava run, which had been eroding various minerals.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The only exit, save the way the group had come through, is a solid bronze door at the south-eastern end of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They head over to the far door treading around the edges of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue inspects it for traps and locks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big, beefy door is <i>nothing</i> compared to the brawn of the Dragon Mage!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well then, here goes!” The mage <i>lunges</i> into the door fairly at a run.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue <i>BLASTS</i> into the bronze door, making it flatten and ring throughout the ensuing hallway.  As the door crashes to the ground, a crack grows from the edge of the battered door, growing and creasing...  meandering...  until it attaches to the hole in the floor that connects to the lava run!  The floor caves in, taking Maouelue and Benna down into the crevasse.  Bellatrix is nimble and hops away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaaaaaaghhh!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ssss...ss...sssorry...sso sorry!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Really....ssso soooryy.."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix comes over to help you both out of the lava and administer aid.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A rattling of a door handle can be heard over the din in the room.  A door opens, steps echo...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The party, licking their wounds, stands to attention...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Step step, click...  step step, click...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An old man's voice, "Snarr?  Snarr, did you finally break that blasted door down."  He chuckles softly.   "'Bout damned time."</p><p><i>Click, step step...  click, step step...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Snarr is gone. He left through the seal. And you? Which way will you go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s travails are clearly getting the better of his temperament.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One more <i>click</i> and an ebony staff comes into view, attached to a gnarled and wrinkled hand.  Rounding into view is an old eladrin man, with white hair down to his waist.  He wears it unadorned, loose, and most of it is fly-away.  His eyes are piercing lavender, but he looks worried.  "And who might you be?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I...” Maouelue falters a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...I am called Maouelue.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin nods.  Then shakes his head.  "That may be the name you use, but not the name you were given.  What have you done with my giant?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye. You seem to know me old one. As I said before, Snarr has felt the seal. Are you the one that took his arm then?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shakes his head again.  "No, not I.  The one that imprisoned all of us down here.  We all serve The Dragon.  For good or ill.  More than likely ill.  Do you and your lasses enjoy tea?  I might be able to find something stronger, given time."  He turns and starts walking back the way he came.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Mao leans to the others, “Who <i>is</i> this guy?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They follow a few paces back.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group follows the old elf a short pace to a nicely lit room, which you all notice immediately is temperature controlled as well.  A cool, calming feeling comes over you all as you are urged into the space.  There are bookshelves, desks, and an experimentation table set up, alongside a pair of chairs and a rickety but nicely maintained cot.  Because of the plethora of items in the room, there's not much space for movement.  It reminds all of a prison cell, albeit a comfortably adorned one.  The elder eladrin offers everyone seats and brings over a freshly brewed pot of tea.  He conjured cups for each of you and asks, "So, who's for tea?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue politely accepts.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bella and her sister are a bit hesitant, but figure it’s best to go along.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles, pours, as well as one for himself.  And the tea is excellent, a hint of jasmine and honeysuckle, very light and sweet.  The eladrin sips and leans against one of his tables.  Smiling at the arranged crew, he says, "So.  I can only assume you have many questions.  I have a few myself.  Who would you prefer to begin?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Please, speak. We are...a bit out of our element here...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No pun intended, of course."  He smiles.  "Firstly, I would know why you don't go by your true name all of the time.  Is it shame or convenience?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I have only <i>just</i> learned it. It still sits oddly on my tongue.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I would imagine so.  If you don't mind me saying so, that name will become infamous.  If it isn't already so.  You might be able to change that, but...  we shall see.  Now, on to better things, what exactly brought you to the bowels of the Fortress of Frozen Tears?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The words seem to unsettle Maouelue who shifts uncomfortably on the spot.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It would seem I am led here by more than one thread of fate, if everything I have heard these past months is to be believed.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And which threads would those be?"  He sips his tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a deep breath before speaking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I was told...I have a brother here. A brother whom I have never met.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin nods, encouragingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We seem also to follow, or be drawn along, in the wake of a mysterious Runemark. Giants and Dragons and Naga....oh my. It’s quite a tale in its own right...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It led us to the Summer Eladrin...the city of Starlight...” <i>The Mage’s voice drifts off into a minute reverie...</i> “And now here, under the frozen Fey tundras have we slipped and fallen on the slide of hubris, and though I feel nearer my destination than ever, the more I feel it sliding away.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nay, lad, you're not sliding away.  Although, the path ahead is extremely treacherous indeed.  As you've already seen."  He looks meaningfully at the trio.  "That being said, what little aid I can give you, I shall.  On one condition.  There is a spell that I have been trying to break for some time.  It seems the mage who locked myself and my cohorts down here liked to play with planar binding magics.  In the castle above, there is a crystal which should be the source of the binding.  Search this out and destroy it, and my aids will not be given in vain.  Is this acceptable?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods, reverently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We will break the stone. But pray, give us your name...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "My name...  is Aeneir."  (History check with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue recognizes the name immediately, but many of the stories he's been told are a bit hazy as they were told to him as a child.  Aefir had a younger brother, Aeneir, who was a great mage.  A seer.  It is said that through Aeneir's divination magic, Aefir was able to know about his destiny.  If this eladrin is serious, he would have to be way older than the Summer Court members, and, quite possibly, the oldest elf in all of the planes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Æneìr?....</i>”</p><p></p><p>“<i>Can it be?...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It can.  And is.  The damnable wizard we both seek conjured me up from the aether and bade me do his bidding.  I've been on death's doorstep for millennia.  It would be good to...  take the next step.  That is where you and your retinue come in."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What can you tell us about what we might find above?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A castle of ice and frost.  I'd wager you'd do well to find boots that grip the ground or you'll be sliding constantly.  It has been some time since I last traversed the palace... but both our wizard and the Pale Prince enjoy their...  creatures.  Abominations lie in wait, and more than likely a guard for the crystal.  Wits and cunning will go a long way, too.  Did you have any <i>special</i> requests in mind?"  He smirks and sips more tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Can you sense the presence of a half-elf that recently disappeared from here? He was of our party when...the demon...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir looks sadly down at the ground, then up to meet all of the eyes staring back at him.  "Sense... no.  But his destiny lives on past this day.  You may yet find him on the material plane.  Or maybe your ancestors will.  It's times like this I miss my eyeglasses.  I used to look over the top of them when I said things that profound."  He chuckles and pours more tea, offers to the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The group looks stricken for a few beats, then....</p><p></p><p>“Do you insinuate some other <i>special</i> that you would grant us in hopes of fulfilling this duty?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There are boons...  and there are boons.  It would depend on what you feel you need, but...  I'd like to be of some service to your party, yes."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Most gracious of you indeed. I do feel there is <i>something</i> missing as yet from our fold..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I fear our deficit may be a direct result of my, ahem, penchant for impetuousness. Perhaps summat that would allow me to either prevent or assuage harm that I might cause along the way. Something to protect those around me. I am a mage, but also a man of metal. The Platinum wants not but for zeal..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin smiles kindly at the mage.  "There is no deficit, although I understand why you would feel that way.  All you need to do is ask.  I can only give what I have, but it might be that the stars will align?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Please then, give us this boon. We ask in the name of Albrek."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He narrows his eyes, eventually nodding and closing them.  He raises his hands at the Dragon Mage, a gold glow surrounds Maouelue...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, and you'll find three pairs of boots outside the room."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We are most grateful for these gifts. On the edge of a knife, it helps to keep one's balance. May our mutual ends be met with such true aim."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I would suggest putting the boots on before your long rests.  You can attune to them properly that way.  Also, I know you ladies have not had a proper rest.  Here.  Take this and be well."  Aeneir gives the women a glass of something.  "I'll just be writing here at my desk.  Please rest, and let me know if you require anything else."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, we will take rest here and plan for the trials ahead. Thank you Æneìr. May this be the beginning of a new era here at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group takes the rest, getting things together, planning for the next steps of the mission.  The liquid in the glasses that the ladies drank healed their exhaustion and let their short rest work as a long rest.  Everyone has new boots, and before long, everyone is ready to trek out.  (Anything you'd like to do or discuss in the interim?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray, before we go, I would ask of you one more thing. Would it be too much to ask for a handwritten spell scroll, something of your design. I am first and foremost a scholar, and should I...we make it out of here alive, I would be honored to add another page in your history back at our academy."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir's back is to the group, writing at his desk.  Maouelue sees his shoulders briefly raise a couple times, and he turns in his chair rolling up a piece of parchment. </p><p></p><p>"Great minds, and all that," he says as he hands the rolled up parchment to the mage.  </p><p></p><p>As Maouelue grabs it, Aenier holds on to it for a beat, not letting it go.  "It will only open when the time is right.  This is the most powerful magic I know.  Follow your path, seek to do what is right.  And your group will see days upon days."  He smiles and releases the scroll.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue bows reverently and accepts the scroll with two upturned hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir leads the trio back out of the room, into the hall and past a couple more closed doors until they reach a hallway moving south and grading up.  "Take this way through the mountain.  It will twist and lead up, eventually ending in a door.  This will lead you to the lowest level of the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  Good luck, and may the gods bless you all."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks deep into Æneìr’s eyes and sees the countless ages told there in every freckle of the iris, the darkest depth of his pupils. </p><p></p><p>“Until we meet again, Master Æneìr.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They walk on down the hall</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Below the writing, carved in the ice, is a dragon mark.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage casts a couple of furtive sideways glances at the sisters and moves closer to investigate the sigil more closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dragon mark looks to be a signature, the same as the one on the giant gate below.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a hallway with stairs leading down to the south; all of the steps and walkways seem to be either ice blocks or stone iced-over stone.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Are everyone’s boots secure? Come, follow me as far as this the place will allow.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads them South down the corridor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women nod quietly to Maouelue and follow.  Thirty feet S the hall opens up on the left (E) into a large, circular room.  In the center is another large brick of solid ice, but there looks to be something inside of this one.  It's in the center of the room, on a small island connected to the outer walkway by a wooden bridge.  The water around it sloshes as if there was a current or something underneath the surface causing it to move with a current.  The room is lined with bookshelves, completely filled to the brim. They all are iced in place, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are three halls branching from the outer circle - two to the NE, one directly S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Mao raises a hand to the ladies to hold their position, then sets a tentative foot out on the bridge, testing its surface before moving fully across.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It holds, but there is movement in the waters underneath the mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He sends Fammy down for a flying lap around the water as he takes a step back.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>🤮</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's bat flies out to scope the area.  It's not very big and the bat makes quick work of it.  It's definitely a magical water, as it's not frozen, however not much more can be gleaned.  As it's making a last pass, a tentacle shoots out of the liquid and snatches it out of the air, and brings it below the surface.  At that moment, Maouelue loses connection with his familiar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks at the water below with concern and sends a cursory ice blast down to roil its surface.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A freezing cold blast hits the surface - and is absorbed into the liquid.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm...here we go again...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out to the water with his feelings and begins to weave... </p><p>[Shape Water]</p><p></p><p>He takes a portion of the water below and forms it into a shroud of ice spikes hovering the surface below him as he walks across the bridge.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue reaches for the 'water', he finds he's unable to grasp it.  It feels like liquid to the touch, but he is unable to form it through magic or take away any in cupped hands.  His hands are completely dry when lifted out of the liquid, too.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An oily, grey tentacle tries to grab at the mage, but is unsuccessful.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves across for a closer look at the ice cube in the center.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Awesome!  How'd he do? ⚽</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage resigns himself. </p><p>“Alright...I guess I’ll have to do this the old fashioned way...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks down in the water to find a trace of the beast lurking within.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The eladrin longbow is drawn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pool is warm to the touch.  As Maouelue peers into the depths, fathoms appear before him.   It is impossibly deep, and, at the bottom, a massive beast circles the pool.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds feel like minutes as he watches the ominously graceful monster maneuver what for it is a small space.  Suddenly, red eyes, three stacked on top of each other, snap up towards the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It swims, cautiously, towards the surface.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The humongous creature hovers mere feet from Maouelue, red eyes darting hither and yon, not seeming to focus on anything.  Then, they snap forward, freezing the interloper where he is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Telepathically, it says to Maouelue, <i>"Am I not the most impressive, the most powerful and magnificent creature in all the worlds?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You are not.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That honor lies with the Platinum.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deep within your mind, hidden away for some time, you hear purring of an ancient dragon who is well pleased.</p><p>With the first word, the beast begins to open its mouth.  But with the second, it cocks its head and its body twists oddly.  With the last, it blinks.  Maouelue gets the feeling that, if it could smile, it would.  Then, it disappears from the liquid, fading away into particles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmph...well then...<i>very impressive...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue raises from the pool, Bellatrix touches him on the shoulder to make sure he's okay.  "Whatever you did, it must have worked.  The doorways all...  flashed.  Wouldn't have like to see what might have happened if we tried to go through without...   whatever it is you did."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Praise Bahamut.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s go left...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trio move off back across the bridge and around the circle, heading for the northern-most exit.  A sharp right (N) turn leads the friends down a short flight of icy stairs and into a very large room.  At the far end of the room (in the W) stands another large brick of ice, the same dimensions as the other.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Mao once again raises a hand to the ladies and steps forward, what with being a...what was it again? Tenir? Maouleue couldn’t remember, but at any rate he <i>feels</i> like a chosen one.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans in close to the ice and inspects it all round.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao doffs his gauntlets and reaches out, touching faith.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's hand rests on the ice block for a beat, enough time for him to notice that it is slightly warmer than the rest of the room around him.  Suddenly, he is transported to a small, sunlight-strewn room reminiscent of a green-house.  A variety of plants adorn the room, and the colors range through the rainbow, showering the room in brilliance.  Directly in front of Maouelue, a small table holds a very unique plant.  It is potted and just starting to grow, and has a small purple bulb at it's top.  Two small barrels are next to it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins by inspecting the lot of plants around before honing in on the contents of the barrels and the plant in the place of honor. </p><p>“What m mysteries lie below this frozen fortress! I wonder if there are more writings in here?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard moves cautiously through the flowering plants, curious and calculating.  Multi-hued roses bloom, hydrangea, gardenia, hyacinth, iris, lily...  all full and exploding in color.  Quite a contrast from the slate blue-grey-white of the ice palace.  As he meanders and approaches the small table, the purple petal atop the newly-sprouted plant opens.  As it blooms, it shows that it has facial features.  The mouth opens to say, in a high, quiet voice, "Welcome traveler.  There are two barrels of magical sap next to my table.  Feed me and I shall grow."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue obliges.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He inspects the cask on the left first, checking for how the lid opens, pulling out his dagger to pry if needed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cask is sealed tightly, but Maouelue can take some time to look at it and pry off the lid.  Inside is a deep blue, viscous liquid.  Looking around, there is nothing to transfer the sap to the plant, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He also attempts to open the second one the same way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The second opens, the same blue liquid, just less of it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How do you take your feeding, ser plant?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That is up to you, saer mage," it says cryptically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes out his small knife and dips it into the container on the right, pulling up the viscous sap and proceeds to drop some, like so much honey, onto the soil around the plant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Slowly, drop by drop, Maouelue feeds the strange plant.  With each drop, the stalk reaches to higher, the purple petals grow a deeper hue.  Eventually, it looks fully developed, healthy and beaming.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, wizard."  Two seeds then sprout from under on of the leaves, and it continues, "One is for you, one is to plant.  Use them wisely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you, most gracious and well-spoken of flora. Pray tell me, would you like to join your cohort on the sides of this room? I could give your offspring a head start here in this most fertile of soils."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It bows to Maouelue, and raises its 'face' to his.  "Thank you, kind saer.  But I believe I would like to stretch my legs myself."  </p><p></p><p>The dirt starts shifting and Maouelue sees two root-legs come out and breech over the pot's edge.  They land on the table, and with a large, full-bodied stretch, the small plant takes a couple steps and hops down off the table to meander itself among its brethren.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Will these marvels never cease!" Maouelue jests to himself. He begins to plant the second seed and calls out to the plant, "If I may, what are you called, master plant?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although Maouelue is fairly knowledgeable about nature and even arcane-based flora and fauna, this one puzzles him.  He remembers reading, some time ago, about a species of sentient tree-folk, but the name and exact details of it escape him. </p><p></p><p>"Call me sapling, dear mage.  Once I mature past my smallest stage, I will know a proper name and my place in...  whiche'er world I shall be a part of.  For now...  I am just...  sapling."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Very well, sapling, I shall do so. Do you have a regular "gardener" in this place?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Prince comes every now and again, but he does not tend my family or I.  He is not allowed.  Only the seekers shall tend and reap the rewards...  or despoil us and be punished."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around for a moment, considering just how many "seekers" there might be. </p><p></p><p>"One more thing before I part...May I take some of this sap to nurture this seed, or am I to be left to my own for such a thing?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sapling turns to Maouelue and smiles.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first to ask.  Absolutely you may.  And may the Earth Mother bless you and the seed you shall plant."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bless you and your brethren. My kind has a fondness for all things that grow. May the sun rise to meet you and your harvest be bountiful." With this, the mage takes out the emptied superior potion of healing jar and rinses it with a bit of water from his skin, then dips it delicately into the sap. He takes one last look at sapling before nodding reverently and walks back south to rejoin the other, stowing his valuable seed safely in his pack on the way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he walks towards the end of the room, the garden evaporates behind him and his cohorts come into view again.  Maouelue is back in the room with the ice block, staring at a stunned Bellatrix and Benna.</p><p></p><p>"You just disappeared!  Then you were back, an instant later!  This is a strange place indeed."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"An <i>instant</i> you say? Curious indeed. Dear disappeared Daran did tell us about the wiles of time in this place... Let us just say, that I think I've passed the first test. Let us move on, counterclockwise."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trio exits the room, retraces their steps back to the wooden bridge, then S to the exit there.  They continue into a small, cold room, with hallways moving off to their left and right (E and W).  Maouelue can see the E hall opens into a pool of liquid, rectangular this time.  The W room has odd angles and a further exit can be seen on the far wall.  (Roll20 updated.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue moves left down the East hallway to the pool and sets about inspecting it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is a decent size, rectangular, and very, very cold.   There are motes rising up from the pool, which has been completely iced over.  From the ceiling hang dangerous icicles.  Frost and ice slicks spatter the walls here, as if water had been flung at it and it froze instantly.  Even with all of the warm weather gear, Maouelue's bones ache and he can hear the women's teeth chattering loudly behind him.  As he peers into the frozen waters (definitely frozen and not like the arcane liquid in the circular room), he sees something frozen in the pool...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[2000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ice crackles a bit as Maouelue is looking through the frosted surface.  There seems to be a pulsing happening deep within the pool.  As he watches, a shimmer seems to ripple at the very bottom.  Moving his head makes the shimmer move throughout the pool itself.  Then it hits him...  he's looking at dragon scales.  Shimmering with the light of Bellatrix's torch.  Benna gasps, Bellatrix nearly drops the light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maoulue takes note of this and beckons the ladies back out of the hall. "Stay here at the crossing," He says plainly before moving West to inspect the other chamber.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue inspects the Western room, and as soon as he enters, he sees a statue of an enormous creature, frozen in place, along the northern wall.  It's actually frozen <i>into</i> the wall, become a part of it somehow.  The odd appendages and legs meld into the ice and seem to flow from the being, giving it a melted, grotesque quality.  Where it's not melded into the wall, Maouelue can see the creature's features fairly plainly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He casts a few cursory investigatory glances around the other three quadrants of the room including the West corridor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Further in, the W corridor bend N and continues down a long stretch which ends with another ice block, similar to the ones seen before.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lining the wall in the middle section, are suits of armor, icicles hanging from sections.  But their silver sheen doesn't seem diminished from being in the frozen environment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Metal Mage meanders by his mirrored mannequins and musters up to the molded mass in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks for the now-expected writing on the ice block.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the metal mage meanders past the armor...  he hears a loud <i>craaaack</i> of ice breaking loose of cold metal.  Looking behind him, a lone suit of armor steps down from it's dais, red flames appear where it's eyes should be, and it raises it's great sword to attack!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The metal mage muffles a guffaw as the slashes are deftly parried.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You must have grace beyond measure if you are to wield a sword such as that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Coming closer to try and hit Maouelue, the suit of armor is still frozen in a few places.  It slashes with some uncoordinated attacks, and they're blocked by the armored magician.</p><p></p><p>In response, it says, "Merrrr.....MEERRRR..."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p><i>{Catch your breath - you can only take a move action next round}</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Seeing his opponent off balance, Maoulue weaves words into spell and attack intertwined, dancing.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>...But dancing in boots is hard. He might have to go to the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The suit raises it's helm to show Maouelue the burning demon within.  A thing of frost and ice looks out, with red eyes burning.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue feints to swing, then reaches for his belt, pulling out a small grey bag...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is whisked away to a vast, open field of grass.  In front of him is a giant wall, over eight feet tall.  Just in front of the wall are five beings, what looks to be a dwarf, a halfling, a gnome, a human, and a dragonborn.  The dragonborn can reach up and touch the top of the wall, while the gnome is well away from the top.  There are shouts coming from the other side of the wall, clamoring for aid.  The five are in a frenzy about how to scale the wall.  The halfling sees you, runs over, and says, <i>"Hey mister, we're sure glad to see you.  Our families are on the other side of that wall, we need to get to them quick - do you think you can help us?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dragonborn, you flank the wall, followed by the human; forgive me, I do not yet know your names, but we can deal with the pleasantries later. Master dwarf, you come next followed by the halfling and gnome respectively. Thus you shall form the fellowship of the staircase and scale yourselves up. Human, toss the dwarf if you have to, dragonborn, cradle your hands as a step and your shoulders to boot. The lot of you should be able to hoist the dragonborn thereafter, and if naught else I can provide a push. May these tactics lead you to those who call for aid, and may you provide it well and willingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group does as you say, lining up against the wall.  (Mechanics - group strength checks for everyone to get up and over, then to pull the dragonborn up.  Soo...)</p><p></p><p>The gnome gets up on everyone easily enough.  The halfling is nimble enough to get up on the wall without too much aid as well.  The dwarf, however...  is a bit heftier!  </p><p>(First strength check is for the dwarf getting pulled/pushed up the humanoid stairs.  3 rolls, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone strains and tries as much as they possibly can, but nobody can lift the dwarf.  You see that, after a certain number of tries, the people fade away.  A few moments later, they reappear, huddled in a circle, discussing how to get over the wall.  The halfling notices you, comes over and says, "Hey mister..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue chuckles to himself, “Alright, let’s see here...” He takes a closer look at the construction of the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's just a wall.  Too tall for a single person to get over, but just a standard stone wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Normal soil.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us see, do you lot remember me from before?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets blank stares.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right then...Master dwarf, how high can you jump?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps and gets about a foot off the ground.  Then shrugs, comically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right...this will take a little time, but we'll get it sorted out."</p><p>[Rest to prepare a spell?]</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll try this way first."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So...let's see that jump again!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the boots and the spell, the dwarf jumps straight up to the wall and lands...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Somewhat gracefully at the top.  His left boot hits the edge, he slips... but catches himself at the last to kneel firmly on the top of the wall.  He reaches down and starts helping the others up again.  Soon it comes down to the human and the dragonborn.  (Plan for getting them over?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok now, lets pass those boots down!"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell</p><p>Rolling 2 iterations...</p><p>1d20 (<b>1</b>) = <code>1</code></p><p>1d20 (14) = <code>14</code></p><p>15 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The human takes a running jump, but can't get the depth down and crashes into the fall, falling over.  The dragonborn ups just fine, putting his hand down for the human.  The human stands, shakes itself off, and tries again...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The human jumps, but the boots are tied together, and he trips again.  The dwarf misses him, but the dragonborn grabs his arm and pulls him up.  (Maouelue's turn!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a hefty <i>sproing</i>, the metal mage makes it to the very edge of the top of the wall.  The dwarf stabilizes him and the group now looks out over yet another vast field of blackness.  The world seemingly ends here.  One by one, the people jump down into the blackness and disappear.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well blimey... what an odd sort of place this is..." He looks behind himself again, back down the grassy side to regain his bearings.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"All I gotta do is juuuuuuuuuuuuuuump!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard jumps into  the void.  As the blackness envelopes him, it morphs and he feels himself floating through space.  A hazy blueness starts as a pinpoint of light, widens out to encompass his vision entirely, then focuses into the large block of ice with the person inside.  The giant elk nudges the newly re-appeared man, while the boots Maouelue had lent to the small group are waiting for him atop the cold block in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sounds of dripping can be heard from somewhere in the corridors connected to this room, echoing off the frosted walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well Elkamigo...I dropped off that great wall, came unglued, fell into a deep well, and landed to reform here, <i>and</i> I took care of my shoes! Not bad for a moment's end I'd say!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I see... you're just staring at your walls..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But hark! Do I hear echoing footfalls? Or is that just the mire of the cavern? Let me sling up my baskets and we'll ride back down the line."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Elkamigo chortles something sounding suspiciously like "Do what you gotta jiboo."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Elkamigo look S towards the rooms opening, but nothing presents itself with the exception of the echoing dripping.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They ride South and Mao pulls the reigns up just as they start, thinking to take a closer look at these suits of armor.</p></div>
