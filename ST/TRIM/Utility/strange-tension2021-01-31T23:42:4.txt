strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The mage and company follow a guard escort to the armory, where the doors are opened and are ushered inside.  There is a side table with four chairs, and Daran immediately draws one out and sits.  When the guards leave the room to take their posts outside the door, the ranger says, "Whats the play here, Maouelue?  We really going to do this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I go to do this thing. None that would turn aside need follow me. You have all taken on more have your fair share thus far. I go to free these lands once and for all, so that we may have the realm at our back when we go to the citadel. None will be able to deny me should I do this thing.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage moves through picking up the trinkets from his last venture here. He gazes at the two swords, then turns to the guards. “If it would please the Queen, I shall take Midsummer and Midwinter to fulfill this deed.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guards turn and say, "Nay, we cannot allow you to take up those, they have to be given by the Queen herself.  If you would like, we can send an envoy to ask the Queen for you?"</p><p></p><p>Daran shakes his head, and gets up to lean in to whisper in Maouelue's ear.  "This is a suicide mission.  I am not sure what was said, what was done, there are insane rumors going around.  It doesn't matter, though.  All of us could go with you - the entire gods-damned army could attack, and it would still be the same.  This is madness, Maouelue.  The Queen could even deny you aid after you come back successful...  and that is a big if.  Are you sure this is the best course of action?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How can man or elf be sure of anything in this w- <i>these</i> worlds Daran? What <i>isn't</i> madness?</p><p></p><p>Here, for the first time in ages have I felt rest; it was but false. The <i>best course</i>, you say? No friend, it is not. But, it will keep us in the Queen's good graces and out of the realm's wroth for now. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is well. I have seen him through Lanrion. He is well attended, and I have no fear we shall meet again. Something here is a part of this and whilst we are here, it is our duty to attend to it.  </p><p></p><p>I do not ask any of you to follow me blindly into death. But I do ask you hinder me not."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks at Maouelue.  He lower's his head in thought.  Bellatrix comes over to give Maouelue her unspoken support.  </p><p>"I will not hinder you.  I will be behind you.  I brought you here, what happens to you all is partly my doing."  He lifts his head, saying, "Faen nha."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao takes up the guard’s offer to inquire after the swords, then goes back into his stoic posture.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix pats the wizards back.  Daran sits back in his chair.  Benna wanders through the armory quietly.  Time passes.  Eventually, Daran stands and starts going through his gear and adding armor and weaponry.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao secures the trinkets he had previously spied in the armory and sets about looking for a good eladrin longbow and quiver of arrows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao offers around a few trinkets to the group, having reoutfitted himself. His Amulet of Health he offers to Bellatrix, the Mace of Reduction he passes to Daran.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A splint mail he proffers to any who would take it</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A ring of fire resistance he hands to Benna</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The time passes slowly, especially in the silence.  Soon, boots are heard outside the hall.  Jelentrianna and two more plate-garbed summer eladrin sway in.  She marches over to a main table in the room, sets out a few scroll cases, then turns to face the group.  "Please continue to arm yourselves.  When you all are ready, we'll go over the plans for the raid on the opposition's main keep."</p><p>(Daran's got some good armor, he picked up a couple things, too.  Bellatrix and Benna aren't proficient with that armor.  Or any, for that matter!  Witches!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran takes the mace, and clips it on his belt.  Maouelue sees two gleaming scimitars replace his others.  He also has a newer longbow with golden-fletched arrows.  He was eyeing a cloak as well.  Bellatrix and Benna both take the items, Bellatrix gives a small smile in return.</p></div>
