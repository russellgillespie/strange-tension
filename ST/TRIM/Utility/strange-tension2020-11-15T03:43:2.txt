strange-tensionDieter is able to remove the two items from the drawer.  A jeweled encrusted dagger with a curved blade is the first item.  When unsheathed, it is dull black.  It almost looks wet.  The page is written in a serpentine language.

The dagger is coated in the blood of a higher demon from the Nine Hells.  It cannot be wiped off, nor can the dagger be destroyed unless it is consumed in the fires of the Nine Hells.  If this blade kills anything with a soul, that soul is bound to the blade.  Each soul collected gives it the ability to kill an entity of a higher plane, god or demon alike.  This would also relate to the sarrukh, who were the original serpentine race, the progenitors of all serpentine peoples.
*He stows his shortsword...*
*De Druid desias de dagga. Destinee ‘as delivered Dieter de day...*
*Dropping downward, digits dexterously descend, drawn deeper, daring death’s demise.*
*Dieter drags da dagga. Darkness digs, dividing dawn deities, dusky daemons dominion devour defenses.*
*Death*
*Darkness*
*Dominion*
*Dagger*
*Damsel*
*...*
*Dieter dashes to the dais.*
*Draws the dagger!*
“My friend!”
“My friend!”
“I’ve got a dagger!”
*Dieter drives the dagger downward into the diaphragm of the downed damsel.*
*Maouleue marches mesmerized*
*His armor a mirror of the wild, frenzied scene.*
The knife pierces the woman.  Again a wound, a tearing of flesh.  Yet the woman does not stir....
Until...
As Dieter plunges the knife down, his hand grazes the woman's skin.
Her eyes open and she looks down at the two wounds in her chest.  Blood starts pooling at the man's hands.  Black blood oozes from the cut Maouelue made, while there is a sizzling sound of frying coming from the site of the black dagger.
"M...  Master?"  She calls to Dieter.  "Why?"
She is pale, a ghostly white.  You'd never noticed it before, but you suppose she's looked like that from the beginning.  The color of bleached bone.
Her hands reach out to caress Dieter's face, lovingly.
“Destiny.”
She smiles.  "I could be."
*A primal rumble emanates from the Druid’s chest.*
*He locks eyes with her.*
*He reaches out to her face.*
*He twists the dagger a bit and tilts his gaze curiously looking, if possible, deeper into her eyes.*

Dieter looks into the eyes of the woman.  Blood stains her thin shift.  Her smile beckons him.  Just before their lips meet, Dieter pulls away, pulling the dagger from the woman's body.
She shifts her legs off of the dais.  "Is something wrong, Master?"  She frowns at you.  Coquettishly.
“Show me your mind.”
She cocks her head, questioningly.
“When you read this, what do you see?”
*He holds up the parchment.*
She cocks her head the other way, looks into Dieter's eyes.  "What do you want me to see, Master?"
*Dieter’s eyes flash’s t the mage, they are black and red.*
*The mage’s eye glances quickly at the dagger, then back to the lady.*
*Dieter reels a moment, then looks down at his hand. He is suddenly sickened, and pulls the dagger out, staring dumbstruck at the blade.*
The woman looks at the Dragon Mage, peers at him as if noticing him for the first time.  Doe eyes bat at the man, then back to Dieter.  "I'm alive.  Thanks to Master."  She gets up.  She's rail thin, her hair is waist length and jet black.  It somehow conflicts heavily with her extremely pale skin.  Aside from the dread you both feel, you can't help but think she's one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.
Looking intently at Dieter, she says, "Whatever Master wants, I will do."
She looks down, then at Dieter.  Her laugh is a girl's laugh, innocent.  "I can't lift that, Master.  It's too heavy for me.  Also, it is attached to the floor."  She approaches Dieter, slowly.
“Except what I want.”
"I can only do what I can do.  I can do many other things..."
“Show me...”
She approaches closer to Dieter, smiling.
She reaches out to kiss Dieter.
She stops.  Looks at Dieter, pouting petulantly.
"You're no fun."
*Dieter is caught between torment rage seduction and longing. His eyes flash color after color.*
She whips her head to the mage.  "You can certainly try.  Wouldn't it be much more fun to just...  give in?"

She raises her eyes, feigning being impressed.  "Lord of dragons, eh?  I've met many lords.  Not one could ever stave off my...  personality for very long."  She smiles coyly at you.  "It seems we are at a crossroads, gentlemen.  How should we proceed?"
“Stave off...”
“Stave off!”
*He takes the end of the staff of baobab and thrusts it into the open wounds in her chest!*
The staff goes completely through the woman.  She looks down at it, nonplussed.
"Master is mad," she pouts.
*He stares, amazed, for a moment then pulls the staff back out. He turns to the entry way.*
“Follow me...”
*He goes to the left and stands at the edge of the plates.*
"Yes, Master."
“Walk across this room.”
She cocks her head at Dieter.  Then smiles widely at him.  "As you wish."
She steps lightly on the trapped floor.  Midway over the tiles, she turns to look back at Dieter.  "Care to join me, Master?"  She walks backward to the across the rest of the tiles, staring at Dieter the entire way.
“Follow me...”
*He leads her back East and around to their construction near the lava.*
