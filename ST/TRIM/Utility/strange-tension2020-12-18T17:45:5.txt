strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The third is the mark of the Arcane Brotherhood.  Frume pipes in about this one, as he mentions he has dealings with the city of Luskan<s>, or which it is now known as, the City of Anarchy.</s>  They are a fringe society, but what they lack in notoriety, they make up for in pure ambition and magical prowess.  There are a set number of seats in the brotherhood, one has to die in order for another to be raised into the sect.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last...  eludes even Frume.  He scratches his head.  "Looks like a death cult of some kind, but I'm damned if I know.  You feel that chill, by the way?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Follow the air. It will guide us out." <i>I hope...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter goes over to the East door and checks the handle while feeling around for the draft.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Feeling a draconic irony overcome him, Dieter hands Frume a bottle of Gold Dragon Ale and pulls one for himself as well. His third and final, he proffers to Shelli, seeking any sign of interest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail sticks her... nose (?) up at the brew, but Frume taps your bottle and says, "Fucking cheers to that!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The E door is closed, but not locked.  The carvings read oddly, a few have been scratched away.  Frume meanders to the S door, burping small flames every now and again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whatcha make of these carvings, Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stows the third ale, knowing what it does now, he hopes to see the look on Maouelue's face when he gets the chance to quaff this last.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He traipses over to Frume all the while keeping a nose out for the source of the wind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid's eyes flick back and forth over the distressed carvings.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The breeze feels like it's coming from different directions at different times.  (Arcana check for the doors, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's tough because these look like they're legible, but the language is either very ancient, or set up to trick your eyes when you read it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter turns back to his search for the wind. He produces a flame to help guide him in the direction of the draft, watching as the flames are pushed this way and that.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame in his hand flutters, dives.  Corrects and becomes still.  Then violently wavers again.  It becomes like bubbling, boiling water.  It grows in size, double, now treble the size it once was.  In shadows above, gliding down, is a shadow spectre, wrapped in grey smoke and floating down directly at the druid!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter releases the flame and steps backward, assessing his options.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>With what time he has, he takes note of the spectre’s shape and form trying to perceive its alignment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's ethereal, swathed in smoke.  It is not being aggressive, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Greetings, dark spirit.” Dieter coughs in his best abyssal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The smoke roils and expands.  A hoarse scream comes from the center of the entity.  Dieter looks and Frume and the spectre are holding their heads in their hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume hits the floor, a line of blood running from his nose.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Something you want to tell me, Frume?!?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That voice, lad.  Cuts straight to my brain, I guess."  He wipes the blood away as he comes to sitting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spectre stays hovering, but is backed further away.  There is a soft blue light illuminating the smoke now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This time Dieter slowly approaches the light making no vocalization. He walks steadily and reaches out for the blue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ghost reaches out for Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter makes to take its....hand?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I will not be overtaken. I am here to commune.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The visage seems to cock it's head.  A message, a soft voice in the back of Dieter's head, barely audible, speaks, "Can't.  Have to. Show."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is feeling the dark pull. The thirst for knowledge. The thirst for the power to drive his own destiny....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a deep breath of smoke.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid is engulfed in smoke.  Frume gasps and reaches out for his friend, but his hand encloses on nothing.  Dieter is transformed...  And the two beings.  Vanish.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>We last left Maouelue and Daran on the road back to Oakhurst.  They've taken a side road as to stay away from the Runemark's men.  As they make their way down the trail, they're on the lookout for enemies.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran has a keen eye and he constantly looks toward the horizon for any hints of trouble.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The weather is overcast, looking on the verge of rain.  Daran smiles at the clouds.  The duo make their way down the road in safety.  (D100, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>While walking down the road, the pair round a bend and see a human woman, clutching her leg, prone in the middle of the road.</p></div>
