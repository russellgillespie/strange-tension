strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The mage looks closer at the runes, and there seems to be another, thinner line of script written around a symbol of two dragons chasing one-another's tail.  The dragon symbol is in red against the gold background, and the ring around the symbol states, <i>Those with the dragon mark, a red dragon lineage, or fire giant heritage, place your hand upon the seal and open the gate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Uncertain, Maouelue hesitantly extends his hand, palm outward to the seal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing happens.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmph, worth a shot." He casts a glance around. "Any of you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Assuming there are empty gazes,) Maouelue takes a moment to do another rubbing taking the contours this seal down into his book. He looks one more time around the device for any other signs of concealment before leading the group down to the doorway at the end of the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women shake their heads as they gather up some of the treasures.</p><p>Upon exiting, the three notice a rotten stench coming from the end of the hallway, not altogether different than the flumph gave off.  A sickly yellow-green mist comes up from the bottom of the door., which stands a bit ajar already.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sends a blast of hot fire searing toward the doorway, standing at the edge of range.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the fire from his hands reach the methane gas, sparks ignite the smoke... and the room!</p><p>(Dex saving throws for everyone, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Bellatrix take 9 points of damage, Benna takes the full 19 as the flames incinerate the simple door and back-drafts straight to them.  As soon as the rush of fire passes, they hear a low laughter coming from inside the now very smokey room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh Benna! I suppose....I should have asked you all to stand back. Something about the deep places brings out my quixotic impetuousness."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You in there!," Maouelue's voice cracks a bit as he attempts a challenging tone, "Show yourself!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is shuffling from the room, as smoke continues to billow out.  The laughing turns to gruff growling and a metallic scraping can be heard just under the growling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A big booming rumble of a voice breaks the eerie silence, saying, "WHO'S THERE?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets his metallicomets spinning around him, like a fiercely charged atom, hoping stir the air and clarify the fog a bit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It is I, Lumao Albrek. I come solely in the pursuit of justice and peace."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix whispers, "Mao... are you <i>sure</i> about this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"DON'T KNOW NO...  MAYO.  GO AWAY."  The voice, although booming, sounds a bit forlorn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue steps forward into the smoke, comets a-swirling. "Though it may not seem it, we do not come to threaten. Tell us, who are you? What is your station here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I AM SNARR THE ONE-HANDED.  I HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED HERE FOR MANY YEARS.  THE WIZARD, HE TOOK MY HAND SO HE COULD TRAVEL, THEN LOCKED ME AWAY HERE FOR ETERNITY... JUST IN CASE HE NEEDED ANOTHER HAND."  (All of this has been in Giant, by the way.  The women would have no clue what or who you're talking to!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Tell me, O mighty SNARR, just who was this <i>wizard</i> of whom you speak. Tell me, and mayhaps we can be of service to <i>each other</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A shuffling then a huge <i>WHUMP</i> sounds on the other side of the doorway.  Smoke rushes and billows out past the heroes, clearing to see a humongous fire giant looking at them through the doorway.</p><p>"CAN YOU GET ME HAND BACK?  IT WAS THE BAD WIZARD.  CALLED HIMSELF SHIV THE DRAGON.  LAST I SAW HE CUT OFF ME HAND AND WENT THROUGH THIS DOOR."  He points to the doorway with his hand-less stump.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come then Snarr. There is something you need to see. Perhaps something that will find you <i>exactly</i> what you seek. Follow me."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers something a moment...</i></p><p></p><p>"...Unless you are in some way bound...?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I AM.  I'M TOO BIG TO FIT THROUGH THE DOOR." Maouelue can see it would be impossible to get him out through the door in between them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm...let me think a moment..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If you would let me do something...<i>a bit of a trust exercise</i>....I may just have an answer. How well do you feel at the moment?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"WELL...  THAT FIRE DIDN'T HURT, TICKLED REALLY, BUT...  I'M KINDA HUNGRY.  COULD USE SOME FOOD.  DRINK IF YE HAVE IT.  THEY DON'T FEED ME MUCH, I THINK THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"HOW'RE YOU?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah yes, I know we've got a bit here somewhere." He grabs a few rations from his pack. "Ah yes, here we go. It's not much, but hopefully it's a start!" He leans back a moment to fill the others in about the goings-on.</p></div>
