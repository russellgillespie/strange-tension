The voice of a woman - sweet and lilting, like cool water on a hot day - comes into the minds of all collected there.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You have not won.  You will never will.  To those who thought they destroyed my Pale Prince, you will have hell to pay.  We will make sure of that.  For those of you who took my keep and killed my pets and friends, you will die as they have.  Do you not know?  I am eternal.  You cannot kill me.  You cannot hope to best me.  Some will say I have run, fled in fear of my life.  I tell you now, that is not the truth.  As all know, the best way to preen a large group of people is to get them all to one place.  Then, you only need a way to kill a large number of people at one time.  Good thing I've known how to do that since I was a small girl.  Go to your rests with the knowledge that I am not killing the one I want.  Goodbye."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Darkness surrounds the man as he awakes from a deep, <i>deep</i> slumber.  The small sounds of breathing, several things breath, can be heard in the cramped, damp room.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The vault is quiet, with the fire having gone out some time ago as Dieter's spell dropped.  The Druid awakes refreshed and alert.  Nothing is moving, only the breathing can be heard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Coming to and frowning at the newfound crick in his neck, Dieter Deleter blinks open and awake. A powerful feeling of refreshment flows over him.  Sometimes when you finally allow yourself lay down after a long hard push, your body starts making the decisions for you. So it was now with the Druid, who wincing slightly as he attempts to arise, begins to reckon with all that has happened so far…</p><p>…and all that lies ahead.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks over at the others, his weird new brood of ragtag braun, schlurp, and hop, now in the winter hours of their repose. Lord knows what devilish things await them on this never-ending day-night in the Sunless Citadel. </p><p></p><p>The shapeshifter’s hand idly runs over a frail page of parchment and he draws a breath. He takes a moment now  to recall his readings, as he is reminded of their matters, or at least those he had perused before succumbing to capitulation.</p></div>
