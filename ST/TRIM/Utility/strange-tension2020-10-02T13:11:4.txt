strange-tensionHe feints as to hit Dieter, but at the last moment, he dodges to the right to try and end Douglas's life.  Douglas takes the blow as a cut across his forearm.  Bloody but still alive, Douglas covers the body of Maouelue as the goblin advances.

*Dieter, obviously enraged and off kilter, spits on the corpse of his enemy.*
[150 xp to each]
*Dieter frantically runs over to his fallen comrade and looks imploringly at the man who has blessedly just stabilized his friend.*
"I...  I think so.  He needs medicine and rest.  I'll bandage as best as I can.  We should get him back to town as soon as possible, though.  What brought you two adventurers down here in the first place?  Not to say I'm not thoroughly grateful, many thanks for your aid here."
He looks at you in awed reverence.
"My name is Douglas.  You've talked with Culver?  They must have known I was missing when I didn't show up at the damned pub, I bet."  He chuckles.
"Probably the only good thing to ever come of my boozing, I guess.  Well, since you're my rescuers, I might as well share what got me in this trouble in the first place...  First, help me place your friend in a mine cart.  I'd be happy to push it to town."
*Dieter, overwhelmed by this good news, gasps a bit in shocked relief.*
*Dieter shudders*
"I really don't know much about any boss, but we've seen a lot of goblins around the mines lately.  Not sure what's driving them here.  The reason we came is this." He tosses you a coin.  On it are some runes, in a circular pattern. It is finely crafted and the etching was done by a professional. It is a standard silver. However, the markings are unlike anything you've seen before.
*Dieter examines the coin more closely. He attempts to channel his Druidic origins in search of any memory of such an inscription.*

*Dieter, just then recalls quite how long theyâ€™ve really been in the mine. The initial shock of seeing his comrade fall has now receded, and an overwhelming exhaustion overcomes him. He staggers slightly.*
"Hey friend," Douglas says, easing Dieter down.  "I got it from here."
*Dieter gingerly sets down in a shadowy corner and offers Douglas a torch from their packs.*
"Much appreciated."  He grabs the torch from Deiter and a scimitar from a fallen gobin and sits at the top of the stairs.
*Dieter, feeling exposed, but incapable of caring particularly much about it, blacks out in exhaustion. His dreams are filled with muffled gnashes of teeth and strange languages emanating from shapeless forms...*
*Maouelue stirs restlessly, half a wizard eye open while otherwise incommunicative.*
The two adventurers spent their first part of the rest in fitful slumber, but eventually their minds settle and they get the rest they need.  They both wake up alert, rested, and feeling oddly stronger. (I believe you have enough xp to level up?)
Douglas sits at the head of the stairs, sharpening his new scimitar with a makeshift whetstone.

























*Slowly the two adventurers rise to the rhythmic sound of Douglas sharpening his blade. Their eyes meet and they seem to instantly recognize that they each have grown significantly as a result of this venture. A slow grin breaks across Dieter's face...*
*The adventurers look to Douglas and ask whether he is keen to push a bit further into the mine, to put an end to this 'Boss' and avenge the desperate souls who lay slain in the chambers above.*
"Aye, we can traverse the mines.  Not much to them, really, this part at least.  This is a fairly new dig.  There is a much bigger one across the hills, still a part of the Krytos Hill system.  I was there for a little bit, bunch of Dwarves in charge over there.  Here it was every man for hisself.  There something in particular you wanting to see, friend?"
The three of you roll the cart through the East tunnel of the Krytos Hill mine, putting bits in that you think might be useful.  There are some smallish silver nuggets, shovels and pickaxes, various miner-related gear.
As the cart is being wheeled out to the main cavern area, you notice the campfire has completely gone out, there is no smoke emanating from it.  The bedrolls are still there, bites have been taken out of it, rips and tears that indicate of animal habitation.  The morning sun is peeking through the entrance, slightly shrouded as it is still fairly early.
*They beckon to Douglas to follow them into the first corridor.*
Three travellers move down the West tunnel, past the other bedrolls, and approach the steep staircase.


Dieter slips down the last few stairs, but Maouelue and Douglas right him.  As you enter this further tunnel, you see the carnage from the day previous.  The smell hits you, then you notice the carrion scavengers around.
*Dieter takes a closer look at the scavengers trying to discern their species.*
They're actually kind of a mixed breed.  Rats bred with some other type of vermin.  They're not currently hostile toward your party.

*Dieter communes with the scavengers, imploring them to reveal anything they have experienced recently that might indicate whether there are more mortals remains in the area.*
