strange-tension"Aye, thanks there.  Sorry if I added any hits to ya in that fight.  Not quite meself, if ya know what I mean."
*Maouelue searches the remains.*
There is some chitin, some of the poison is leaking from the thing's maw.  The teeth are intact.  The appendages have been diced up pretty well by Frume.  (Anything you're looking for in particular?)
*Dieter has a newfound fascination with poisons and venoms. He takes the empty healing potion bottles and fills them with as much of the maw poison as he can.*


*Maouelue fiddles with his bracers as he digs, then removes them in favor of an amulet. He would need to pray over the items in the dawnlight before using them again.*
Maouelue remembers seeing Veena change in front of them all, he knows they are Naga now.  He also knows that it takes a powerful Naga to walk around amongst humans, and for so long.  Naga absolutely loathe humanoids.  To walk among them would be tantamount to blasphemy.  There must be something else at work here other than Naga trying to fit into a society, or ingratiate themselves into a community like Oakhurst.
*The group picks up and carries on toward the next door, toward their fate.*
The team exits the S door, it's already open.  It swings wide into a 5ft wide hallway.  To the party's right there is another solid oaken door, banded with iron, 5ft away.  To their left (E) the corridor continues straight, opening into a vast room with high ceilings (30 ft) and massive pillars.  Just before that room is a hallway to the S.

*They try to open the door.....ON THE RIGHT!*
The door on  the *right* opens onto a beautiful golden idol.  Made in a very ornate, flowing design, it depicts one snake, rising into the air, while it's tail curves and wends its way toward the creature's mouth.  It is 10ft tall, what looks to be solid gold, and is positioned on a square onyx base.  (Inspection or perception checks for more!)


Dieter looks at it - looks like a pretty nice statue!  When Maouelue takes a closer inspection, his elven eyes pierce a veil on the idol.  Firstly, the thing is extremely well crafted.  Looks possibly to even be on elvish make.  Second, its a mobius strip oroborous.  However is was constructed, there seems to be only one side to the snake.  Perfectly formed, you marvel at how this was accomplished.  Lastly, you see there are fine gems inset for the eyes.  They burn a bright red-gold in the torchlight.  They are so close in color to the gold, you might have never seen them if you hadn't been inspecting so closely.
*Maouelue considers a moment, then takes the point of his sword and tries to pry the stones out.*

The sword can't catch the edge, he won't be able to pop the stones out like that.
*He pulls out a small knife instead and has Dieter produce a flame to try and loosen the gold fittings.*

They are just not budging.

*Frowning, they leave the statue alone and close the door. They then lead on to what would originally have been left.*
You could swear you hear a seductive hissing as you shut the door behind you...
The party continues and comes to the fork.  There is a hallway to the right.  Maouelue sees, with his dark vision, a thirty foot hallway that ends with another oaken door.  In front of the party, you get a better view of the large room before you.  Besides the pillars, there are many other statues here.  These are not gold, though.
*They turn right toward the door at the end of the hallway.*
The hall trends downward, maybe dipping 5ft in all.  The door at the end of the hall is unlocked.
*They go in*
The door *creaks* open, revealing a dark cavern warren.  The walls, ceiling, and ground are all poorly dug out dirt.  Roots and vines twine through all.  There are ratty bags of feathers, rags, bowls of grease, and bat guano covers pretty much everything.  As you take a step in, crunching of small insect shells echo and grate your senses.
*Dieter takes a few feathers and corks another bottle of grease.*
The grease smells *awful*.
*They eff back off to the last hallway.*
There is a causeway in the SE corner of the room that lead to more caverns.  One goes E, the other S.
*They take note of this and head back to the the other hallway.*
You enter the massive room, torchlight doesn't even reach to the other end nor does it illuminate the ceiling.  Maouelue can see the dimensions of the room, but the bright light is limited.  (Perception or Investigation on anything, let me know!)
*Dieter looks for any sconces or braziers*
There are several, all throughout the chamber.  Some still have torches in them, but they look like they've gone to seed.
*Dieter produces a flame and tries to light as many of them as he can*

*Maouelue takes a look around.*
There are statues of humanoids, goblins, orcs, a variety of beings littered around the room.  No rhyme or reason, it seems.  The pillars have sculpted snakes running  the length of their 30ft height.  These are very finely crafted.
*The group starts trying to shove the statues over. #)
