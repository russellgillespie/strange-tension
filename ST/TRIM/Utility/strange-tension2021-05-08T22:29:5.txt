strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>A deep sense of calm comes over the wizard.  The small room fades away, Maouelue soars through clouds.  Tufts of white flow by, then part to reveal an immense forest below him.  The wizard flows down further, below the clouds altogether, and close to the tops of the tallest trees.  Interspersed between the trees, at the base of seemingly <i>every</i> tree, is a pool of water...  no...  not water.  Liquid, but not...  water.   As far as Maouelue can see, the forest continues in every direction, endlessly.  </p><p></p><p>Dipping further below the boughs, Maouelue sees sparse foliage, neat grasslands, and, again, thick tree cover rolling across the entire landscape.  The pools are colored in a rainbow of hues.  The vision stops at a massive tree with a golden liquid pool beneath it.  As he looks up, Maouelue notices a golden apple on one of the highest boughs.  The vision fades back to the heavy wand in Maouelue's hand.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>(Oh, by the way, this is pretty overdue...)</p><p>[3000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue lifts his gaze expectantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Is this your choice?" says the voice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It is.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room, table, wands dissolve around Maouelue, with the wizard still holding tight to the heavy wooden wand.  He reappears in the frozen room, but this time there are noticeably less leaves on the tree.  It's nearly barren, the ice now covering the majority of the trunk and even moving onto some branches.</p><p></p><p>"It's an interesting choice, wizard.  Have you always wanted to play the martyr?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hard work and a keen intellect were the values Shi’Vandos instilled in me. Sartorial considerations and ostentation often mask a lack within. One who lives pure and true has no need to proclaim.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Strong words.  We'll see if they're still strong after we meet.  We're waiting..."  Another leaf falls from the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage lifts the wand up to the golden apple and ever-so-gently touches it with the tip.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The apple falls from the tree, Maouelue reaches to grab at it as it falls, but it slips through his fingers.  As it heads for the floor, just before it hits, it disappears.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“No!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks searchingly back up to its original position, hoping...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few more leaves fall from the tree.  The apple doesn't reappear.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Steeling his breath and strapping his wintery boots on tight, Maouelue tries to ascend the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although the armor is heavy, like his spirits, the mage pulls himself up through the boughs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He climbs and climbs, looking for a central crook that is uncovered as yet by the metastasizing ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue finds what he's looking for fairly quick.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s hope this works...” he half prays to himself as he pulls out the small bottle he had refilled with magical sap what feels like an age ago. Once again, he dips his knife into the sap , this time coating the blade fully in the viscous liquid.</p><p></p><p>“Grow. Fight. Live.”, he implores the tree as he holds the blade point down over the exposed bark. He watches, breathless on the edge of hope, as the drops begin to fall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sap does seem to bolster the tree, but the ice is moving too rapidly to stem the overall tide of the Prince's machinations.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Enough of this charade, <i>Brother.</i> Come out and face me.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tsk, tsk...  It is a good guess, but no, Lumao.  I am not your brother.   He is far away from here.  But he was here, once.  He may be the only person who truly understands my pain.  I must admit, too, I enjoy his plans for...  correcting the imbalance.  I do have a message from him for you, though.   Shall I save it until we're face to face?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue does not reply. Instead he looks upward, assessing where these branches lead? Could he climb further yet? The old feeling of being pulled by strings of fate and power-hungry machinations roils to his core.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he comes to a determined conclusion. </p><p></p><p>This time he points the wand directly at his own heart. He grips a branch from the tree firmly and says, “I am ready.  Take me to him.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a slight chuckle, and the thin voice says, "I believe you have the wrong impression of that wand, young wizard.  But what you ask is...  curious.  I wonder..."</p><p></p><p>A few moments pass, then a circle of bluish-white appears where the door to the tavern room was before.  It widens out until the circle reaches from the top of the wall to the bottom, and stretches to fifteen feet across.  Through the door, Maouelue can see a blank white space, akin to the clouds he was just floating through.  Farther in, he can see the bottom half of a person dressed in black robes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Was wondering if the power of the tree could be channeled like that.)</p><p></p><p>Maouelue moves down to meet the figure on the threshold.</p></div>
