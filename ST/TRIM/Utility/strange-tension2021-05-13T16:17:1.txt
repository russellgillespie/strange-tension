strange-tensionThe pale elf nods, sadly.  The two bundles drop to the floor with a sickening *thud* and *squelch*.   The Prince slowly pads down the few steps of his throne, keeping his eyes locked on Maouelue.  

"So it shall be."

"CELESTIA!!!"


"And now for yours, you pitiful child!"

Bella, her blood unfreezing  now, dances for Maouleue and tries to move the Prince with her malice.
[Blood Witch Dance DC15 CHA]
He turns to Bellatrix.  "You are supposed to be dead, my dear."
"But *you* shall be!"


The witch rushes now to Maouelue's side, preparing for the full onslaught.


A wave of blue/white light comes from the middle of the Prince's chest.  It wavers in the air and creates a shimmering sphere around him.  Still burning, he pats the fires out and smirks at Bellatrix.)

Benna’s voice cackles and echoes, bounces even, eerily around the room. As the position of her voice becomes unclear in the reverberation, so does her form.


Stowing the starlit wand, he draws out the Eladrin bow, attempting to pierce the pale veil.




“Daran, this ones for you, wherever you are you stoic rogue.”

“Never mind though! That bubble looks pretty thick!”
“In that case, *Dance!*”
[DC 15 CHA]

The fierce blood witch takes up a defensive posture, ready to strike should the Prince deign to come within range.
[Ready Multiattack, Init next]
The Prince saunters back after being moved mentally by Bellatrix.  He moves next to the crystal and says, "How I wish for this pain to end..."

He snarls as the frozen cone whips out to sting at the mage and the witch.
She moves like the wind, this time not cackling, to take up Maouelue's other flank.

"Nice going hot stuff!" she whispers creepily into her sister's beaux's left ear, sending shivers up and down his spine in a way that not even this permafrost has to this point.

Maouelue takes a few clanking steps foward and left to clear his line of sight, pondering.
He feints to reach for another arrow, but pulls out something small grey and slightly furry instead!

"Don't murder *me!* Murder *him*!"
DI1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (7) + 2 = `9`.

"Where does he get all of these lovely toys?"
The mage points to the platinum dragon on his shield. "This is why I *can* have nice things!"


"Ruff!"
"Rough, I agree."


"You're not the only one with toys..."
He raises his hands above his head, cups them, and as he brings them apart, an icy staff appears in his grip.  He levels it at Maouelue and the witch and says, "DIE!"

A rain of ice, sleet, hail, and brute force winds pummel the two.

"Bellaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"

Benna was added to combat with initiative 15.
"Bella, take these... may the material serve as your conduit!" He hands her 50 Platinum Pieces before rushing away from the ladies, wary of another area attack that could take them all.
"Rar."

"Away now Jerry!"
"Ruff!!!"
Bellatrix looks at the twinkling Platinum in her hands, then casts a furtive glance over at her beacon of light, "Mao, are you sure about this? Remember last time?..."
"Bella, this is Life *and* Death! I *know your fear*, but I will not let it overcome you! It is time! NOW!"
She takes in a deep breath as she moves weirdly up the stairs only to turn back and shove her sister out of the way. "Away Benna!"
