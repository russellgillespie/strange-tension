<div class="character-1"><p>"OW!  Someone shot me!  Please help me!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Ouelue gets closer, she notices a bolt sticking out of the woman's hamstring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Surely darlin' you would be so kind as to help this distressed maiden here. You know I haven't the...color for such work. That's a dear..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran eyes Ouelue askance and moves to check the woman over.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"This is in too far for me to do anything.  We have to move you."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger goes to wrap his arms underneath the woman, and she screams.  Shaking her head, she says, "No, it hurts too much.  Damn!  Here.  Please.  I need to get this to Kennet Arrunson.  He runs the Pig and Falcon in Oakhurst.  This needs to get to him tonight.  Can you do this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We can't just leave her here..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue braces and approaches the lady. She stifles a retch and lays her hands around the wound.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran scans the surrounding area.  "Keep an eye."  He turns around 360 degrees to search the woods.  To the woman, he says, "Did you see where the shot came from?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman shakes her head.  She then says, "Thank you lady.  Ah.  It still hurts.  Here, please take this."  She brings out a silvered feather pin and asks, "Can I pin this to you and deputize you into the messenger guild?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Nay...You will be healed."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"This may sting a bit..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue pulls hard at the bolt and presses the wound, beginning to chant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes go wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bolt catches on something, she screams and...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Stays conscious, but just barely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We need to get off the road.  All of us."  Daran looks at Ouelue meaningfully.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm sorry about that. I thought I could do better." <i>shudder</i></p><p>Here, take these for your pain and patience. We'll deliver this for you."</p><p>Ouelue takes the Messenger Guild pin and adorns it on her breast. She then digs in her pack and hands over the Tao of Earth and the jar of glowing red mushrooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue heeds her hubby's humble heckling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hefts the woman under her arms and drags her, a little roughly, eyes always scanning, into a copse of tall grass.  Tall enough to hide them, but not well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman accedes to being dragged.  She then looks at the new items in her hands with confusion. "What are these?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sets the woman down more gently, then draws his bow and, with a finger to his lips as a warning, he wades back to the road silently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well to be honest, some good reading and...something to...er...experiment with should the reading become too dry.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She shrugs, saying, "Uh..  Thank.  You..."  She looks at the mushrooms in the jar.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Ouelue realizes, she cannot hear nor see Daran.  He is very stealthy, but she can neither see nor hear him anywhere.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(S)he pats her pack seeking the net of invisibility.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(I believe you grabbed it the last you used it?)  </p><p>The woman opens the jar, makes a face, then politely puts the top back on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few minutes later, Daran creeps back into the area looking frustrated.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What did you spy there Daran.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Not a damn thing.  Which worries me."  To the woman, "Who is after you?  Or is it the letter someone is after?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We will deliver this message with all haste. May we lead the pursuant away.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, we must hurry!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"If we leave this woman, and she doesn't have the letter, she dies.  Do you have anything that can help her?  Or magics that can spirit her away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue places the amulet of health around the maid’s neck and whispers a prayer to the lord to send forth its healing and to aid them in their mission.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, following Ouelue's direction.  He roots around in his pack, pulls out a strip of leather that could be a belt or strap.  "Put this in your mouth and bite down," he tells her.  She does, and he grips the bolt.  "Why don't you try to pull that out one more time, this time you'll have my help."  He braces the leg and the woman, motioning Ouelue to remove the barb.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This time Ouelue lends all her empathy into feeling how the bolt is lodged and reaches out with her feelings...</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"This should work, but let us keep to the edge of the road, and let us move quickly."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s make for Oakhurst in a hurry.”</p></div>
