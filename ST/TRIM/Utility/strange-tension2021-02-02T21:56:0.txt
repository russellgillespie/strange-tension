strange-tensionWith that, the troupe picks up and begins to head out to their destiny, for better or worse.
The guards throughout the palace are at attention, saluting the team as the they exit the crystalline Castle of Starlight.  As the constant autumnal sun shines on the courtyard, a garrison of troops are waiting in salute there as well.  Four horses are waiting to take the group to the Eastern Docks.  Once there, they board a small ship that will take them down a tributary and into the Vale of Long Night.  From there, as the ship deposits the team in the freezing cold, the group looks over the barren wasteland of snow and ice.
Distance, like time in the Feywild, is amorphous.  Malleable.  From the map, looks like the destination is over a mountain range.  Maouelue sees a range to the north and one to the south.
The mage surveys the frozen lands, the iciness fields matching that of his heart. There is comfort in this, frost, the one thing he could always count on. He surveys the lands looking for a low point in the ranges ahead of their destination in readiness to push off.
The troupe starts as Maouelue picks a route towards the southern mountain range.  Tall peaks look daunting as they trudge through low snow drifts.   The group bundles up more and more as they walk on.  (Survival checks and Constitution saves from everyone.  Feel free to roll for the sisters, they're straight d20s.)

The cold is getting to the group already.  (Three strikes means a level of exhaustion.  This early might be...  bad.)  The good news is that the sun stays out, no blizzard quite yet.   But those clouds to the north don't look good...  The group trudges on more.

The clouds from the north break in a monumental snow storm.  Suddenly, the group is surrounded by insane winds and they're having a hard time even seeing each other.  Daran yells back to the crew, "We should hunker down, stay put until the storm blows over."
“Well said Master Daran. Let us look for cover.”

Feet away is a copse of coniferous trees, providing safety and warmth from the pushing storm.
The group heads there and begins making a small camp.




The four huddle together under the thick boughs of a couple tightly knit together evergreen trees.  The wind whips, but the four travelers are safe and nestled quite snugly in their hideaway.  A couple hours later, the winds abate a touch.  A couple more hours after that , both the wind and the snow back off and it is safe to travel again.

Daran is worried, preoccupied by making sure the group members are okay.  Bellatrix sees them first, and tugs at Maouelue's arm.  There are huge, black creatures wandering over the snowy plain, near the mountain pass.  She tells the wizard that they are enormous, it's not just a perspective.  They are gaunt, maybe around 30 feet tall.  Wisps of black smoke are whipping off of the creatures.

The group huddles in and eyes the passing monstrosities warily, the metal mage sizing them up.
Maouelue has a vision, through whose eyes he's not quite sure.  But he knows these things...

Two nightwalkers are stalking the mountain pass.
They do not see the group.  They're a few miles in front of you yet.  (A good stealth check would be needed to get past them.  Or you could check for another way around/up the mountain.)
As the group starts out again, good ground is made, everyone stays warm, but something has been overlooked...

The group gets closer to the mountain, and as they do, the nightwalkers are dominant on the horizon.  "We heading right for the pass, or we sussing another route out?"
Says Daran.
“Let us make our way around behind the nightwalkers, keeping our distance, to the pass.”


Maouelue and Daran try to spot a safer place to traverse the range.   Daran is at a complete loss, but the Dragon Mage sees a possible route.  It's not the best route over, looks pretty steep from this vantage point, but it's better than the nightwalkers... *shudder*

It's getting colder as the group strays from the path to the mountain pass.  (Two more full check to get to the new route through/over the mountain!)
