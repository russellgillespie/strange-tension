<div class="character-1"><p>The room they approach is pure darkness.  No light penetrates it. (Perception at dis for everyone.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone hugs the wall and moves through the darkness.  After a few steps, everyone hears a low snarl.  No one can tell the direction the snarl is coming from.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter snarls back. He’s itching for a fight by now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He touches his ring.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard’s gauntlets glow blue as he slings his shield over his back, drawing his sword with two hands.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes a moment to slip on a fancy ring as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snarl mixes with a squelching sound, the sound of something moving through muck.  </p><p>It stops suddenly, both the snarling and the sloughing.</p><p>No noise can be heard, the darkness feels like it's pressing in.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing shows as a secret door, the darkness does not dissipate.  Frume suggests, "Let's keep going, lads.  Follow the wall.  We should be able to get out of this soon."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They push on down the hall taking care to hug the wall and watch their footing. Dieter uses his staff to tap the way ahead.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The three push up through the hallway to see around the corners.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the three move through the darkness, they're able to make out a T hall connecting to their tunnel.  They move down the row, when suddenly...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A black tentacle <i>snaps</i> at Frume at the rear of the group.  He just steps out of the way of the greasy appendage.  Two more come out of the darkness, with a high pitched squeal accompanying it!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacle dragging Frume back is sliced through, he rolls off to the side to try and cut at one of the other's..</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>His sword slices through Dieters, they both roll away.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Reeling from two of it's appendages being sliced off, it cannot successfully bring Maouelue any closer.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last tentacle is sliced through and Maouelue is freed, Frume starts running to the end of the hall.  "Let's leave this monster, lads.  We stung it well, it shan't follow us now."  </p><p>(Quick point of order, any range attacks at the thing would be at disadvantage because it's in darkness.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Tentacles flip around the druid, but he side-steps them easily.  Suddenly, a <i>large</i> tentacle emerges from the middle of the mire.  It wraps itself around the armored mage and starts sliding it, again, towards the darkness.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a frenzied slash with his sword in one hand, hoping to his some part of the beast. he strikes it hard in the torso. His blade seems to dissipate followed by his body. He materializes next to Frume!</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The druid swings wildly, hitting nothing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume peeks from around the corner...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Hanging his head, he runs and stabs at the huge tentacle still wrapped around the mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a shriek, the tentacle releases Maouelue.  Partially severed, it flops erratically as it is reeled back into the darkness.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group moves ahead and around to the left.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This hall is familiar, although it was seen from the opposite side before.  Just as Frume is about to step on the raised floor tiles, Dieter pulls him back.</p><p>"Thank ye, lad.  Too busy looking at that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume uses his stump to point at an intricately carved double doorway, oak with iron bandings for the hinges.  Although not quite as elaborate as the garden scene from the metal door, this is just as well made.  The scene on it depicts a ritual taking place, a naked woman is on an altar, all variety of beasts cavort in the background.  Raising a blade in the air, the priest performing the ritual looks odd.  As you all come closer, you can see his face has been seared off, the wood scorched.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter give the door a cursory yank.</i></p></div>
