<div class="character-0"><p><i>On their way out the door, Dieter asks the owner if there is a woodworker or smithy in town they might barter with.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course, lad.  If you're looking for woodworking or carving, that would be Kentham.  Our resident smithy is a brawny lass named Saynea."  He draws up a quick map of the town for your and points you to the shops.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He bows his head to you and says, "Well met, young lad.  Name's Denson Amman."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, we'll keep your things safe and secure, don't you worry.  And the light'll be on all night.  Feel free to come and go as you need.  If I'm not here, my daughter, Kirra, will be manning the desk.  You have a good eve as well.  Stay safe."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They nod and exit the inn. Dieter leads, flanked just behind by Douglas and the henchman, whom Dieter has nicknamed in his mind Frenchman the Henchmen or Frenchy for short, Maouelue brings up the rear, holding on loosely to his companionâ€™s sudden zeal.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter leads on first to the smithy and takes note of the kind of quality craftsmanship he might expect as he approaches, examining the building.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The building is simple, sturdy, and empty save for the burly woman at the anvil.  The front of her building is completely open, letting people see her work and craftsmanship. </p><p> Hot metal is being beaten with fine precision.  Her red hair is tied in a tight bun, muscles ripple in her arms and shoulders.  Her smock and face are covered in sweat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She doesn't hear you coming, the sound of the hammering and the forge are loud.  Plus she is extremely focused.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks up and wipes the sweat from her brow with an arm. </p><p>"Aye, what can I help you boys with?"  She goes back to hammering.  "Sorry, I have a limited time with this as it's hot now.  Let me know what yer looking for, or have a look around.  Everything's for sale."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They inspect the goods for sale and Dieter steps up to Saynea.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She picks up her head, interested.  "I've had occasion to silver some weapons.  I can make ewers or goblets, might take a bit 'o time, though.  I can do well with detail work, but the more detail, the more time I need.   What did you have in mind?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stares at you.  Then slowly starts nodding.  Grabbing a piece of parchment from her front counter, she starts jotting down ideas, then starts drawing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a decent representation of what you want.</p><p>"If you want it quick, it'll be 2 pounds of silver ore.  Cost'll be 2 gold and I keep the remaining ore.  Could get it to you in day and a half.  Better detail work, say 3 gold and 3 days."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the drawing from Saynea and considers it, idly sketching a few changes to the angles here and there. He also seems to be inscribing something intently.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pardon," she says to Dieter, moves over to the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Okay, lad, we got chain armor at 50 gold, scale mail is the same price there.  Goes up a bit with the breastplate, solid steel there, that'll run you 480 gold.  Have some shields, too.  Couple double mounted, good oak core.  15 gold for those.  Solid steel is going to be 25.  I can engrave or detail anything you want, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Now, weapons, if I don't have it in stock, I can make it right quick.  Short and long swords are over there, 10 and 15 gold respectively.  I have maces, cudgels.  Do a fine bit o' work with staffs and range weaponry too.  Just basically depends on what you fancy.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Anything else, let me know, I can probably draw up some plans to suit your needs, like we're doing for your friend there."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sure thing, be right there."</p><p><i>To Maouelue</i> "Take your time.  When you have things together, bring them on up and we'll get you squared away."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"...," looks around, "No...  I don't have a sling, actually.  Woodworker might be able to help you there. Sorry about that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Deal."  She holds out her hand, smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Say half now, gimme three days.  I'll let you inspect it first before the final payment?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands over 10 chunks of silver in payment and 2 lbs worth of ore.</i></p></div>
