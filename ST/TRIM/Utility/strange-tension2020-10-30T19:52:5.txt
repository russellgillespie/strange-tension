<div class="character-1"><p>"...  Aye?  Indeed some interesting magics.  Okay, I won't be surprised if I'm left by my lonesome in the morn'!"  He puts out a hand.

<div class="character-1"><p>"Eh, the Mu-lens you say?  Can't say I've heard of the name before.  I <i>have</i> had some run ins with the snaked variety, though.  Matter o'fact,  there's a opening to an underground lair.  Could be your problem's coming from yon, aye?"</p><p>The man starts riffling through the orcs possessions.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue rests by the fire watching the flames. He relaxes his mind into its usual meditative sequence, going over the events of the day, then casting them toward the stars in his mind's eye. Here in the dark cavern, his memory of starlight is lifeblood. Life...he considers this a moment...his run ins with death... These musings form a blip in his usual steady trance. The scene of Briffo's burial blends with the stars. His song comes in and bends its drifting lines, tracing constellations. Now slowly a low hiss grows and distorts the glorious notes, a cruel laugh, darkness begins to set in. Then a flash of platinum blue sears the scene...there is only one constellation, burning radiantly wavering obscuring all else. An outline only visible in the relief of pure light begins to resolve...The vision of divine justice, of good, the king of dragons....Bahamut's form sears itself into the mind's eye. Maouelue is no longer controlling this meditation, this is something else...A silent voice in his head speaks. It says to him simply, "Life." Then the form turns and begins to alight back to the stars, the form now more visible in the new relief of darkness, the void of space feeling ever deeper than ere it has. As Bahamut set wing to space, the last fleeting glimpse before he took flight was dimmed only by a spectral Briffo, nestled in the crook of a wing, looking out over the vast expanse. He lifts a platinum lute and strikes a final chord, fleetingly winking back into Maouelue's eye. Then....it's all gone. The darkness of the abyss becomes the shadows of the cavern receding to the flickering flames of the fire. Maouelue comes to changed. He knows now in his heart he must use his power to bolster the forces of good and channel his power into life. He stands, a new radiance seems to emit from him, awe inspiring, yet distancing. This new strength seems to come at the cost of a certain kind of knowability, but not loyalty or honesty.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This hunt for the Muhlen sisters is no longer a curiosity. It is a divine decree. Let the roots of evil be laid low for their treachery though the purification of the very soil to which it has taken root.</p></div>
