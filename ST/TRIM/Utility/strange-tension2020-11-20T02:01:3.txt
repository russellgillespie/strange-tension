Next he started pulling them up to let them cool and settle a bit before he would finally flip the mold together and send it down one more time to remove the seam. After a few minutes, he pulls up the rig again and brings it over to the cooling pit, which they had built into the dirt covering the spike pit. His hands glow blue as he sends a ray of frost over the mold to crash the temperature. Steam spews everywhere as he does so. After a while he stops the ray and watches as the vapor begins to dissipate. With a cautious hand he reaches out to touch the mold. He opens up the box and sees three beautiful, pure new orbs, now made of the metal of his master, ready to be put into the line of vengeance.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>And so he did.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>After several hours, he had managed to make quite a few gold shuriken that he set about applying poison to. As he counted his work, he glanced over at Maouelue, who all the while had been repeating his orb processing, and now sat surrounded by nine shining platinum balls. What a sight. What a confirmation of his belief. We are the light drake, we are the dark snake.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>Over in the corner of the 4-way, Dieter picked up stray shuriken and stowed them in his bandolier. All of a sudden, he began tidying things up and shutting down the workshop area. Maouelue's concentration was broken by this and he started.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>That one caught the mage off guard and they each had a mighty chortle. Their bags were nearly set, the workings shut down. It was time now to be on their way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Oh dear...whatâ€”?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And with that, he leads Maouelue out toward the crevasse without a backward glance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And with that he begins singing and weaving his arms, pointing his hands at the soil in and around their side of the crevasse upward, rising.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Then he sinks the Staff of Baobab right down in the soil at his feet, sticking out at an angle into the rising abyss of the crevasse's center. A giant Baobab tree begins to ascend up and outward, climbing into the upper reaches of the cavern, a thin route cut out of the enchanted thicket surrounding the tree's trunk.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage...for once...is speechless.</i></p></div>
