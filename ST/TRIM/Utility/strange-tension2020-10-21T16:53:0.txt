<div class="character-1"><p>The shield is called the Shield of Disruption.  Adds +1 to your AC and it has 4 charges to impose a CON save (DC10+Intelligence modifier) on a creature using any spell.  You can spend 1 charge against the spell, or spend more for higher level spells.  (If you wanted to counter a spell at 5th level or above, the DC would go down by 3 for every level higher.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace twinkles in the candlelight.  This is the Mace of Reduction.  The attack and damage rolls have +1, crits on 19 and 20, and on a natural 20 the target is under the effect of the <i>Reduce</i> spell.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group ruffles through the burgeoning bags of holding to produce the Barbarianâ€™s Wind tome. Dieter holds it in his hand and speaks the rune using his most ostentatious form of Giant.  (He loves to be very presentational in front of the henchmen...)</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid holds the book aloft and speaks the Giant rune, the book glows a glittery blue hue.  The words on the page magically rearrange themselves into different words, pictures, diagrams.  As they come together and form a completely new tome, a sharp pain courses through Dieter's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Fighting back the pain, Dieter attempts to pore over the tome and withdraw its secrets.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the words coalesce, Dieter has a harder and harder time concentrating on the book.  At the height of his ability, he's still not able to comprehend the language or read the book at all.  His headache starts to get worse...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy picks it up and hands it over to Dieter, who hastily puts it on, not fully knowing what it will do.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's a bit awkward to hold the book while putting the helm on, but Stenchy lends a hand to help him sort it out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the helm goes on, a feeling of sharp cold comes over Dieter.  It helps quell the pain of his head, but only momentarily.  (Is he still trying to read it?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cold abates and Dieter starts feeling comfortably warm, noticing for perhaps the first time how cold his surroundings really were before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sets the book down momentarily and produces a flame, he sends a bit of it into each of the emptied rune chests to provide some additional light and heat in the room. He gestures to Maouelue to take a look at the book.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue picks up the tome and tries to read some of it as well. He wonders whether he'll have the same searing experience.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is able to read it perfectly.  It is the musings of an arcanist who was obsessed an ancient race of people called the Netherese.  The land of Netheril was located where the Anauroch desert is today, and a mageocracy of peoples inhabited the land.  Thousands of years ago, the archmages of Netheril controlled magics unheard of, and with their prideful demise, most of the artifacts and knowledge died with them.  That did not stop this particular arcanist from searching, and clearly finding, books and items from the bygone era.  This spellbook is both an account of what the arcanist was able to glean from the books in this library, as well as his dabbling into some of the forgotten magics therein.  The books and items in this room are priceless, worth more than a mansion in Waterdeep for some buyers.  Collectively, you could be looking at millions of platinum to the right person.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group packs up their things and Dieter coalesces the fire and moves it over toward the plate armor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy looks admiringly at the armor and sizes himself up against it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter is responding, Stenchy is already coveting the armor and running his sweaty hands over the epaulets.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Stenchy touches the matte black armor, it's hand shoots out and grasps the henchman's!</p></div>
