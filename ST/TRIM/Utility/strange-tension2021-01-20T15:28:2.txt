strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, turns and makes a motion to the guard at the door.  The ranger has a guard in tow as well, so the four set off into the city proper.</p><p></p><p>The open market is the first thing the group comes to after exiting the palace.  Fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meats, spices all on display.  Various artisans pose their wares, a few of them creating new pieces on the spot.  Music fills the air from several minstrels both passing and stationed in their own artisanal areas.  Beyond are the shop fronts, advertising everything from weaponry and armor to magic elixirs and salves.  A few are fairly unique shops, specializing in curiosities.  The entire city is bathed in an autumnal light from the still setting sun.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Along the way, Maouleue doesn’t speak much. He seems business-like and intent on carrying out a few long overdue bits of trade and to seek out some of the new wares he might find in such a place. He stops first by the weapon and armory to peruse the wares and offer up for sale some of the goods overflowing from his Bag of Holding ™️.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, if there’s any of this you might find useful, it is yours, else I’ll transmute it, so to speak.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep any eye out for any enchanters as well, perhaps some work could be done on some of this too. If we ever do find Dieter, he should have something of Faerie make.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods again, then points to a large shop.  A picture of an anvil with a sword and a bow crossed behind it dominates the entryway.  Wares are put out for display, and it looks like this place is a one-stop-shop for armory and weapons.  A blacksmith's, fletcher's, and weaponsmith's shops are all all rolled into one, and there are several armor stands decked out in front of the place with impressive specimens of the workmanship.  On the decorated anvil sign, Maouelue can read <i>The Unbreakable Anvil</i>.  Loud clanging can be heard from within and near the rear, while a few customers mingle throughout.  There is an elf at the center of the store weaving a leather handle-grip  onto a short sword.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage after emptying his wares takes a moment to consider the old scrolls stowed in his pack. <i>I"ll have to inscribe these upon my return to my chambers</i>, he thinks to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Daran, would you mind keeping an ear out for interested buyers whilst I peruse the selections here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The shop-keep puts the leather-work aside and takes a look at everything.  After studying it (and the pair) a bit more, he says, "This all looks pretty good.  Might need to hone some things, but all in all, pretty good pieces.  Especially that plate mail.  I'll give you...  $1,971 gold for the lot."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm, make it a cold 2001 and we got a deal."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around.  "I don't quite have that much.  Tell you what, if you gents want to look around and grab something, we could make a deal?"</p><p></p><p>Daran looks to Maouelue.  "All I need from here would be arrows."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Maybe a hone for my blades, too, if'n ye do that here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf looks over.  "Absolutely we do!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around for a nice set of greaves to go with his nearly complete set, perhaps a plate or scale belt as well...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The greaves they have are pretty standard, and leather only.  There is a metal scabbard, but it is a back-oriented carrier, not a side holster.  The scabbard looks to be made for a greatsword.  The blacksmith sounds like they're in, though...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm, let us see what's happening over at the forge. Mind keep an eye on our gear here while we inspect."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue examines the kinds of metals being hammered with interest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, perusing the arrow stock.  The shop elf waves and goes back to his weaving.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In the back of the store, a semi-open-air forge is set up.  It's a beautiful design only the elves could come up with.  The smoke seems to be siphoned off by some trellis engineering in the domed ceiling of the forge.  The elf that works the anvil is large by elven standards, brawny, but not egregiously so.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks up when Maouelue comes in but doesn't say anything.  Just nods, and goes back to his hammering.  The hammer is a golden piece, beautifully wrought and etched with elven words and decoration throughout.  It rings with a pure, high note every time it hits the silvery sheen-ed metal being worked.  On  the anvil is an interesting attachment for, what Maouelue can surmise, is a halberd or spear of some kind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He approaches and admires the work. "Good morn good smithy. Tell me do you take commissions here for your work?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a heavy brogue-ish drawl you're not quite sure the origin of, he says, "Aye, I do.  Whatareye lookin' ta fashin?"</p></div>
