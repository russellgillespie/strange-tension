strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob looks between the beasts and Dieter and the sunlight, grimacing with resolve before running toward the door and then quickly quaffing the potion he had received from Deiter‚Äôs throw once he is safe behind the door.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The barghest, sensing something, takes off like a shot out of the downed drawbridge!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>BA1 removed from combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco makes a break for it, sending a covering loogie toward the remaining snarlbeast.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Blarglemarglephaaaarg!!!" He shouts as the stream of misses continues, then dashes for the door in a ridiculous gait picking up his wings like a maids skirts as she walks through a muddy patch. Back and forth he waddles on two talons, eventually making it through the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Still trying to figure out what the hell Flayco is, the barghest stares, dumfounded.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter now shifts the direction of the wind slightly pushing the barghest North toward the drawbridge while still holding out at the door for Shelli.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Wind blows the coarse hair to a fro on the beast, but does not move him further.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúOn Shelli!‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Ha was just gonna do that üôÇ  )</p><p>Jaecob begins milling about the room anxiously and looks over the various wares.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's strange, all of the equipment here seem to be...  foreign.  Alien, actually, as some of the handles on these are meant for longer limbs, elongated fingers, and there are thin layers of...  slime all over everything.  A couple potion bottles are stoppered on a shelf above some bubbling beakers.  The potions colors are red, black, and orange.  On the far table, a map is unfurled and red marks are made all over it - both writing and glyphs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leaves the potion bottles for a moment heading over to the map to try and get some sort of orientation within this foul place. He turns and looks nervously back at the door as he does and gives Flayco a squish pat of appreciation at the effectiveness of his gross bile attack.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúSchloooop! Schleeeeooooppp!!!! Scchlooooooorf!‚Äù She grunts at the final breakstalk pace she reaches lurching for the door.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Feeling as though the door is securely fastened, and not hearing the animal from beyond the threshold moving about, a calm comes over the group.  There is a sense of (strange) tension, either held over from the former fight or from the overwhelming <i>otherness</i> of the room.  Either way, the hackles are raised on all within that small study.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Well past the point of needing a breather, Dieter urges the group to sit for a moment before investigating further. He passes out what is left of the restoratives and passes out some rations. Jaecob tends to his various gouges and scrapes as the whelp and snail curl up beside one another for a short rest.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs something delicious about these swirling red ones after a fight‚Ä¶‚Äù Jaecob chuckles. </p><p></p><p>Dieter let‚Äôs out an appreciative snort in reply then gathers himself up enough to stand. It‚Äôs only now he begins to fully take in the room around him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the short rest continues, the druid looks around and sees everything Jaecob sees along with the door on the south wall.  It's made of a very strange material, akin to metal, again like the sieve-table.  Odd markings line the entire outline and a rectangle of different material is set into the direct middle of the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter walks over to the square and addresses it while Jaecob tends to raking the room for anything useful.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The off-colored rectangle in the middle of the door is non-descript, aside from it's different color than the rest of the door.  All of it has a dull metallic sheen to it, and the rectangle is darker that the rest.  The map is available for the taking (or inspection), as well as the potions on the wall.  There's also the individual potion ingredients strewn about the room, you can do a survival check to find out what you can get there.  (Or let me know if you're looking for something specific and I can let you know if it's there.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter strolls over and gives the map to Jaecob for a closer look while taking his time going over the nature of the alchemical supplies.</p></div>
