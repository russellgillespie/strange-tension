strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Ever since Maouelue touched the chardalyn shard, he's been feeling strange - as if he can feel the presence of the crystals around him.  A possible side effect?  He's not quite sure, but he does sense the presence of a <i>very</i> large shard somewhere to the NW of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And it is fairly close.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue turns on the spot and, as if on a tractor beam, gets sucked right in towards the source of magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He sniffs for it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue moves to the W door, almost as if under a spell.  While facing the door, he can feel it - <i>smell</i> it - to his right, and a little in front...  directly NNW.  And it seems to be pulsing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Now he leans in. He listens to its rhythm</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a steady pulse, one that brings Maouelue back to his roots...  and then it starts to strike an ominous tone.  Perhaps it's the atmosphere, maybe it's the essence of the chardalyn itself, but as Maouelue listens to the inherent beat of the crystal's call, he starts getting very worried.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue creates a gentle rain to drizzle down upon the hurting shard and blesses it as the water falls softly, slowly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Is it a trick of the light, or does he see a tiny Bellatrix inside the crystal, twirling, dancing?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens on a hallway to the right and Maouelue immediately sees the massive chardalyn structure.  It appears to be growing out of the rough stone of the keep, branching several directions as a multitude of individual spires erupt from the central core of the boulder-sized hub.  He peers into the gem and can see Bellatrix dancing, Benna cackling, and...  a strange figure creeping in from the left side of the crystal shard.  He can't see quite yet, but it stands to reason that the room opens up fairly wide to accommodate the many devotees who would honor the shard.  The snarls of some nasty, slavering beast get closer, coming from the W side of the room...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The time comes for all of us to face our demons in the end." He says as he pursues the slavering sounds.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue clanks slowly toward the sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue clambers through the hallway towards the slobbering sounds.  A loud clanging starts up in the W just as the metal mage peeks into the room.  The crystal takes up the center portion, but there are tables and chairs lining the room, as if it were a ceremonial destination.  Maouelue can see there is an exit to the W, being blocked by a distracted...  dog?  No other egress can be seen.  There is an angled stone wall behind him, and all around the room are stone walls with bas-reliefs depicting the Queen of Air and Light in all her victorious glory.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue tucks in just beside the Chardalyn and pulls out his bow, aiming for the head.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow goes very wide, due to the fletching catching on the bow-string.  Maouelue will have to use his next action to either change weapons or quick repair the string.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dog-man (bear-pig) sees the arrow fly overhead and turns to look at the metal mage.  It snarls...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>YE1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (8) + 3 = <code>11</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Maouelue removed from combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>AN1 removed from combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>YE1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (17) + 3 = <code>20</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>YE1 removed from combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>YE1 was added to combat with initiative 11.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man-faced dog bounds towards the metal mage, snarling, foam streaming from it's mouth...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Too close for missiles...” Maouelue quips, “I’m switching to guns.” As he says this, he drops the bow on the spot, pulling out the mace and shield and clangs them together fiercely sending a smiting bolt as the sound clatters around the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage mutters something that sounds vaguely like “For King of Ray.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a yipping, then a barking from outside the room as the hound whips it's head around.  Then it bays...</p><p>(BTW, when Mao sidled up to the crystal, did he touch it by chance?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Well, then....)</p><p>As the man-(bear-)dog-(pig?) starts to howl, a darkness descends in the room, cutting off Maouelue's senses.  A familiar pressure comes upon the mage, and, after an intense, crushing feeling, Maouelue is shuttled back to the throne room of the Pale Prince.  </p><p></p><p>It is an absolute mess.  The walls and floors are cracked, the ground is shaking immensely, and Bellatrix and Benna are completely freaking out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How <i>you</i> doin?”</p></div>
