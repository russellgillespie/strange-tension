strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Although it <i>seems</i> stronger, it's not affecting either of you at all.  The nausea is abated, at least for the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, an arm still grasping a dagger gets <i>sucked</i> with great force under the flotsam.  You both peer into a multi-chambered eye for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It blinks.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then dives away, further down in the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy nods in agreement and they head back to the junction. They inform Maouelue and Stenchy about what they just saw and indicate that they should head the other way for now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group trudges on together up the NE way. Once again, Dieter and Frenchy take the scout role, but now Dieter produces a flame to light their way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It is a very large flame this time.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group takes the NE path, moving quietly...  except for Stenchy.  The wizard, who is constantly checking behind himself for fear of being snuck up on, spies something <i>slithering</i> and skittering down the path behind them.   (Survival check from whomever is leading the group - Frenchy, right?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The path continues on.  As the group continues on,  they see a three-foot diameter hole in the ceiling of the tunnel, directly above them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter raises his flame to the hole to try and light it up a bit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is...  yep, he's fairly sure this hole is naturally occurring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Nonplussed, the group moves on. Maouelue mutters something about snakes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party moves onward.  (Good movie by the way, if you haven't checked it out!)  </p><p>The path continues on...  ten feet, twenty more...  Fifty more...  The skittering keeps pace with Maouelue, staying just at the edge of his vision.  He sees it crawling on the ground.  Then loses it for a time.  The party can hear the sounds of little claws hitting the stones in the floor, clicking together... unnerving them.  Until, suddenly...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tunnel opens into a strange cavern.  The walls arch overhead quickly, almost at a 90 degree angle.  Sounds echo frightfully here.  There are noises of dripping and the slight splashing of water.  The torch illuminates the area, but only just.  The room seems to be getting bigger and bigger the farther they go.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing is no longer behind you.  And hasn't been for some time, you realize.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue beckons the group to put out their lights and to stay by the door while he scouts out the room with his darkvision. He proceeds along the left wall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard looks around as the other three huddle and shine lights around the area.  They are in a large open space.  The three without darkvision are not able to see the walls, but they can hear noises bouncing all around the cavern.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue searches the area, looks up the wall and sees...  a grub-like creature clinging to the wall about twenty feet up.  It's about the length of a grown human's leg, and about a foot in diameter.  It is looking at Maouelue.  Strands of spittle hang from its maw.  As the liquid hits the floor of the cave, it hisses.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tilts his head and hisses back. His hands start to crackle then turn bluish white. He raises them and points them directly at the maw!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>His spell fizzles...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing <i>squeals</i> as it's hit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy, lurking invisibly by the door, lines up a crossbow shot directly at the maw.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy, considerably less stealthily, picks up his crossbow and aims it at...whatever this fucking thing is.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, seeing the beast flailing above, throws his trusty boomerang +2 at the slug and splits Frenchy's bolt in twain!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing tries to scamper higher, but it's getting hit by all of these attacks.  It squeals again, as it gets hit with the boomerang, loses it's grip on the ceiling, and falls, screeching, to land <i>flump</i> on the cold ground.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of it's death cry reverberate around the cavern...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[75 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sounds compound.  Larger sounds join them.  Sounds of something large... rolling, skittering, crawling.  (Perception checks for all, please!  And nature checks, too, if you'd like!)</p></div>
