<div class="character-1"><p>Daran rears up to take this yeti out, but there is a strange noise in the back of the cavern, and it distracts him just enough to massively miss the huge hairy white beast in front of him.  As he misses, he slips on the ice and falls off to the side. (In lieu of the crit card.  I don't have it available at the moment.  Also, afk for a bit.  Presentation.  Feel free to carry on, though!)</p></div>
