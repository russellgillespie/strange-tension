<div class="character-1"><p>"You can feel free to rest and eat here.  Don't have much, or anything fancy, but there's plenty of beans and bread, at least tonight.  And there's a room at the end of the hall with space for some bedrolls.  What else for food...  there's the inn, and, of course, The Pig and Falcon.  I have to take care of this body, fellas.  We'll make sure he has a proper burial after we've gone over it for evidence.  Bellatrix, could you assist us, please dear?"</p><p>Vam goes over to check on the witch, and gently leads her over to Douglas.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Dieter come over and watch make a strange F-shaped gesture to pay their last respects to Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men comb over the body, checking the wounds and the poison stains around his mouth.  They get a very detailed description of the fight with the assassin from Bellatrix.  Ultimately, move the body into the yard and Bellatrix goes about preparing Douglas for burial.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad approaches the two adventurers.  "You gentlemen decided where to sup, yet?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"True, there is much to discuss."  He leads you both to the dining area, where a sturdy table with six seats are stands empty.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue sit down</i></p><p>“We would hear the wisdom of the council. Ere we lay our course. What make you all of this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad makes a showing of offering you seats, then sits after you, playing a gracious host.</p><p>"Well, to be sure, today was one hell of a day.  I'm still not sure I'm not dreaming or not!"  He guffaws, looking around at the others.  Seeing no one is in a jovial mood, his demeanor darkens a bit.  </p><p>He then says, "Listen, there's bad business done here today.  To you, to the townfolks of Oakhurst.  To that young woman out there tending to your friend.  That happened some time ago, actually."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It all starts with missing children in the town.  A whole mess of them went missing, and we just couldn't find out what was happening to them.  When we sent out for help to other towns around the area, they reported the same thing happening.  Obviously, the Council got to work speaking with everyone, sometimes seven or eight times.  I feel we did our due diligence.  And, no matter who we talked to, the finger always pointed at Trix, there."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"She was always the black sheep of the community.  Everyone knew she practices magic.  At one time, our little town was very anti magic.  There was an impassioned plea from Trix's family, and we started turning our minds around, slowly to be sure.  Then someone showed us the black art that she deals in, and, well, one thing lead to another.  She was run out of town.  I do believe this is the first time she's set foot in Oakhurst in several years."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Looking back on it, there probably were signs of what the Muhlen's had up their sleeves.  They were very secretive with each other, to be sure.  How in the hell were we supposed to know they were evil, though?  They've been pillars of the community.  The general store they run is beyond remonstration; they are fantastic business people and generous members of the Council."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam speaks up, "What about the vote on these boys' idea, huh?  We should have pressed them more, there.  Should have known something was foul.  Wasn't the first time on that, neither."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam spits out the door, into the dusty walkway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad shakes his head, still looking uncomfortable.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look down at the parchment.</p><p>Rhahlad starts guffawing.</p><p>Bazad looks like he's going to be sick.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam scratches his head.  "Am...  Am I missing something.  What is that?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad says, "It's some childish prank!  Who gave that to you, seriously?!  That's the best joke I've ever seen, ha.  You boys are all right...  Ah.  I needed that."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party looks at the two men’s reactions with interest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A pale blue comes over the wizard’s eyes as he says this.</i></p></div>
