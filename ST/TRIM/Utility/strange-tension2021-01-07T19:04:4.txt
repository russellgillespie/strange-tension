<div class="character-0"><p>(Lmao</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>just saw that)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The miasma evaporates as the disc moves from the top.  Jaecob peers into the darkness.  Many sets of red eyes stare back at him, from the deep recesses.  Could it be rats?  Fey creatures?  The abyssal monsters he fears most?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He buckles down and fights his fear, but the roiling blackness shows him no more...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter closes his eyes, taps into his druidic roots, finds the flow.  The water in his mind washes over him, turns to dust and grit as a small child grabs him by the hand, leads him to an ancient pyramid somewhere amidst massive sand dunes.  They walk through the massive entry way, make their way deep, deeper into the darkening rooms.  Finally, the last room has a shaft of light illuminating a small disc on a plinth.  The disc that Dieter is holding now.  Instantly, as his mind-self reaches out and touches the object, both entities are flooded with ancient knowledge about the inescapably unique artifact...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter grasps the object a burst of low frequency energy seems to blast inward, momentarily silencing the ambience around him. He both feels and hears a static sizzle lingering in the air around him as he rebounds back into the full sonic plane. Immediately, he turns to Flayco and casts a careworn look in his direction, fearing the worst.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Annulus generates a continuous catapsi (nullified psionic field) effect within a 30-foot-radius of the wielder.</p><p>The wielder gains a +4 bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals psionic damage.</p><p>Once per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action.  (Redirects psionic damage back onto the attacker.)</p><p>As a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to dimensional anchor that affects all psionic-based creatures in a 50-foot radius.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, seeing that his pup is ok, examines the disc deeply. “Yes. Yeeeeeessssss.” He mutters under his breath.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What’s down there Jaecob?”, He sidles up to the edge.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You... ah..."  He looks gravely at you.  "You don't want to know."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tremendous sucking sounds start up from the depths, as if some lumbering creature were slinking up the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks deep into the pit.  With his newfound weapon, he is feeling confident.  Ready to tackle <i>anything</i> that might threaten his family.  Jaecob lights a torch quickly, needing to see better.  What they see is a black pile of ooze, covered in red eyes and viscous looking mouths, using it's black tentacles to reach and push itself up the sides of the pit.  It's slowly coming up, but it just might be gaining some momentum.  The mouths are all saying something, all at the same time.  Gibbering, shouting, cursing, whispering, all happening at the same time.  Some laugh, and high-pitched cackling echoes throughout the area.  Worse yet, the eyes seems to be locked onto the now lit torch.  A roar/hiss/groan/laugh screams out at the duo.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ready for the bonfire?” Dieter questions his companions with a wink.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He sends the great ball of fire down into the hole of goo.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jar on begins pelting magic stones down at the fiend below.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Created attack Magic Stones!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Are you sure you want to delete Magic Stones?</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The ball of flame sears the side of the monstrous gibbering mouther, still about 60 feet below the group.  It tears a section off the creature as it continues to move, swiftly now, up the sides of the pit.</p></div>
