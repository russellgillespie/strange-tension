strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"What?..."  The portly man stares incredulously at you.  He and Bazad come over to the cage, with Vam behind.  They are awestruck at their unblinking friend behind bars of energy.</p><p>"I don't understand, what in the hell is going on here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam explains to the group what the three heroes told to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He ends and a small voice comes through the doorway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That's a lie.  My sister would do no such thing."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue turns, startled.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And through the doorway steps a matronly looking woman.  Her clothes give off an air of being of money, old money, but maybe not much is left anymore.  She saunters in, glides.  If you though the other man had an air of importance, it's nothing compared to Hozieh Muhlen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gestures grandly at Veena-in-cage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Red satin, deep crimson velvet, and black lace adorn the petite body, and make a strange non-cohesion to her heavily made-up face.  As if they're fighting each other for relevance, the two styles are at war with your senses.  She comes across as old but trying to be young, but also young trying to pass as courtly and on-in-years.  It is a very odd feeling, and for those not used to her presence, Hozieh Muhlen makes people feel... strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She very stately strides over to the cage, aware that all eyes are on her.  As she approaches the Forcecage, she holds her hand out.  Bellatrix starts to warn her, Hozieh's eyes dart to the witch and Bellatrix goes still, silent.  All watch as the sisters reach for each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunder crashes in the distance, and a streak of white hot light flashes, searing everyone's eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue blinks rapidly bidding his vision to return as quickly as possible. He searches about with the butt of his staff trying to reestablish his surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two women...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And the two women...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Are no longer there.</p><p>Everyone looks around in astonishment.  No one more so than Bellatrix, who is still holding the Forcecage solid.  There are no rips or tears, she is frantically searching for what went wrong.</p><p>Just then, a horse neighs out front, Heston and Dieter enter the house carrying the wrapped body of Douglas.</p><p>Heston asks Vam, "Pardon, boss.  Where do you want us to put this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He fills Dieter in on what he missed, then turns to address the crowd.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What does the council make of this sorcery?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are dumbfounded, looking on the cage with astonishment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is still moving frantically over the cage, trying to find out what went wrong.  She starts emitting a low whining moan, which picks up the more frantic she gets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nothing!" she screams.  "Nothing can break free from a Forcecage!  That is one of my most powerful spells..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the Five go to inspect the body.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peers into the eyes of each of the remaining council members imploring them to speak up should they have any knowledge of the sisters' intentions.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are uncomfortable, Bazad looks as if he'd like to find a reason to leave.  They start inspecting the body of Douglas.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't really tell if they're hiding anything or not.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls out the bandolier of poison vials and gestures to Douglas' corpse.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How many more honest townsfolk need to die to serve the ends of this pestilent sorcery!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Will you join us in our aim to consolidate the strength of this town? Will you assent to a guild of vigilant watchers? Would you see this evil undone!?!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look abashed, Bazad hangs his head.  Vam stands, saying, "A lot of things just happened right now.  I don't doubt that you have the best interests at heart, and we truly appreciate what you've done here."  He takes a deep breath.  "It seems to me that there is some treachery that has been happening right under our noses."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The portly man starts to object, but Vam speaks up, "Now, listen Rhal, you know as well as I do there have been some strange happenings for a good time now.  Matter of fact, the <i>supposed</i> culprit is standing right here in this room.  I'm not saying all of the facts are on the table, but there's enough for me to say this whole town, and <i>especially</i> the Council, needs to make a formal apology to Ms. Bellatrix here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix's body sags as she releases her Forcecage.  She looks tired, haggard even.  She also looks extremely scared.</p></div>
