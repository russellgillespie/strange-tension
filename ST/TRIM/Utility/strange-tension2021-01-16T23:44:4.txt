strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The soldiers and the material plane group stand in a circle, on Oritnis's orders.  Everyone touches the other's shoulder, and Otirnis says to Maouelue and Daran, "We'll be transporting to the edge of the city.  From there we'll take you to see Queen Titania.  There's been a ban on teleporting within the city.  Got to be that every a'one that could teleport did for the most mundane reasons.  Became a bit of a problem.  Stay close and hold on to your neighbor.  Here we go."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A blue light surrounds the soldier next to Otirnis.  The glow spreads out from person to person to person, until the little clearing was awash in blue flame.  The forest blurs, the light becomes unbearably bright.  Then, in a <i>pop</i>, the entire group flashes, and everyone disappears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Quicker than a blink of an eye, the group now stands next to a cobblestoned road that looks gilt in platinum.  It shines, but not harmfully so.  Hands leave shoulders, pats and back-slaps go around the group.   A few nod respectfully towards the two newcomers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue bends down on two knees in reverence, then takes his palms together, leaning forward onto the platinum stone road. Leaning forward, he touches his helmet to the surface and prays. “Lord of life I am humbled in your deliverance.  My light follows only thine own.”</p><p>He stays kneeling for three long breaths, three seconds, six seconds, nine seconds...Then raises himself back up to the group, collected in spirit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All start walking the platinum road, which actually seems to change colors as they walk.  A rainbow patina effect greets Maouelue and Daran as they travel.  Daran smiles, in spite of himself.  After a half mile,  the trees on either side of the road come to an end and the view of the City of Starlight, Astrazalian, emerges.  The tall wall sparkles as a sky at night.  Beyond the gates, the Starlight Castle careens toward the sky.  Spires and turrets abound.  Color and majesty astound the new arrivals.  Some of the soldiers laugh at the mouths agape.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Astrazalian, The City of Starlight</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue feels the celestial beauty of the city like a blast in the chest, riveting and warm, like home...something he had not felt since back in the tower with Shi’Vandos. Something in the sky</p><p>catches his eye....is it a cloud? Was he seeing things or was his lord presenting himself in the silvery mists above the Starlight Castle? He shakes himself out of it, keen on staying aware of the cohort in which his companions now find themselves. It <i>feels</i> like home, but he knows it’s not. Not <i>yet</i> anyway...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis comes up beside Maouelue's group.  "We'll be heading straight for the keep.  Queen Titania and King Oberon are waiting there with The Seneschal, Queen Tiandra.  There, we will debrief them on all that has happened.  You can bring them up to speed on what we missed and your business in the Feywild.  Then, we can show you to accommodations.  We'll also be available if you need anything, or need to know where to find something in the city.  Follow me.  Oh, and welcome to Astrazalian!"  She smiles and nods.  Then jogs up a few paces to join in with two other winter eladrin.  Together, they lead you down the road to the crystalline city gates.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wonders about as the group enters the city and make their way to the castle.  Every color of Elf stand in the street to see the procession pass.  There are cheers and applause.  Children run into the street to touch the soldiers armor.  Some come up to Maouelue , Daran, and Bellatrix.  Reverence beams on their faces and in their eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The city center is awash with Elves awaiting the processional, too.  When they arrive, it's akin to the biggest celebration day any of the material planes people have ever seen.  Hands are wrung, backs are thumped.  Smiles are shared all around.  Finally, the last climb to the castle is begun, and the shouts of the crowds die away.  The doors of the keep are opened, the group pours in.  Once in, the soldiers split into their different avenues, Otirnis and her group motion the others to follow her.</p></div>
