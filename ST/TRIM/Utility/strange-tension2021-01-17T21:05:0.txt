strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, now recovering his somber and moderately zealous vigor, takes in the state of affairs and the interesting proposition before him and his followers. He looks around to Daran, Bella and her sister. He thinks of Vam and Heston, the wreckage of Oakhurst. He remembers poor Douglas, fallen to the vile Muhlen brood, and Culver whatever became of him. Most of all, he thinks of Dieter... Where in the depths of that foul Citadel could he be? What would he do in this situation? Surely the resourceful Druid was putting his cunning to great use, but how much time did he really have?</p><p></p><p>"My Queen, if I may call you thus, I feel a deep kinship to you and your people, <i>our people</i> and I would see this land restored to peace and glory. I will aid in its deliverance will all that I have to spare. My companions here, I leave to make their own choices, for they have risked much on my behalf already.</p><p></p><p>As are undoubtedly aware, we also face a grave uprising in our realm of Faerun. Dread Neogi walk in the daylight in forms both human and serpentine. Power mongers and arcane excavators have delved too deep into the secrets of our own underworld. As my companion Dieter the Deleter and I followed these dark trails, we followed a series of ancient tombs, each decorated with disturbing imagery of these serpents in their rituals of sacrifice and uprising.</p><p></p><p>It is true that I understand but little of the scope of this war, if that should be how we name it. I fear it is a war that has raged longer than even your sister's corruption. Yes, I will aid you in this cause, for it is far from impossible that these dark threads are bound in some way together, yet, my companion Dieter and I are also honorbound to each other and I will not leave him to fate at the hands of those who would seek to befoul our lands.</p><p></p><p>You speak of a boon and I would receive it gratefully, though I would also seek council and aid in our own fight. As I say, they may indeed be one and the same after all is laid bare."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees the Queen cock her head to the side, thinking, reflecting on the possibility the core of the problem is somehow linked between planes.  "You speak well, mage.  And you reason even better.  My sight does not cross to the material plane as well as it does others, but you have touched on a subject - reached it's core in truth -  that many of our archfey and protectors of other planes have worried over for some time.  There is a darkness that stirs.  It is gathering momentum, gathering strength in the form of powerful beings with long reaches.  I am afraid my sister is one.  You world may have one or many, as well.  This is truly a sobering thought."  She takes a deep breath.  "However, we cannot sit idly by and watch as our worlds are thrown into chaos.  It pleases the court that you would agree to this course of action.  Are you all in agreement, then?  Or do you wish for privacy, or more time to deliberate?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I consent on my own behalf. I invite the others to make their own assertions. I understand the need for haste, but I would ask of your hospitality a moment of repose for my party to tend our injuries and to convene amongst ourselves. I fear we are all still in a state of shock whose depths may yet be untapped. Would you grant us a reprieve of four hours to collect ourselves? After that, I would desire to meet in your war council chambers, if such a think ere had need of existence in these halls, and plan our strategies accordingly."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group looks appreciatively at Maouelue.  The Queen says, "We shall meet in our battle council chambers, but you may take as much time as you need.  Please venture anywhere in our castle or city.  If there is anything you need, we will send you with a attendant."  She looks to her head servant.  There is a short whispered conversation, and she returns to Maouelue to say, "Everything is arranged.  When you are ready to discuss the details, please let your valet know and we will meet here again."  She stands, as do the others right after her.  "It pleases me greatly that you are here, Maouelue the Mage.  It is indeed serendipitous.  You are most welcome here.  Well met."  She bows to you, in their fashion, as do all eladrin in the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stands and bows in return, thanking the Lord and Lady profusely for their hospitality before turning to the valet and asking where they might find their chambers to let down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Court retires to a room beyond the feast hall, the valet ushers you all into separate rooms not far from the throne room, all on the main level.  The rooms are spacious, airy, and decorated simply but elegantly.  A warm breeze plays at the curtains, where beyond is a balcony overlooking the city center.  A soldier comes in, introduces himself, and resumes a station outside your door.  There is  full washroom, a sitting room, and a sleeping chamber.</p></div>
