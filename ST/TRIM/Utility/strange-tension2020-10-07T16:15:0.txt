<div class="character-0"><p><i>The fire and ice begin to create a waving mist around the runes which begins to distort the air as a mirage in the desert.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two journeymen lock eyes in a trance-like gaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trance leads down psychic bends, twists, turns.  Visions mentally fly by the two, trying to come together in some semblance of understanding.  Both are  trying, straining to make sense of their shared dreams.  Suddenly, the trance breaks...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And they see a piece of parchment next to Douglas is on fire.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter also feels a sudden heat in his chest pocket.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees Dieter wince and looks down at his coat pocket. He reaches out with his icy hands and attempts to free the now-glowing rune cloth.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue extracts the cloth and sees that it is somewhat waxen, so it's not completely up in flames.  However, it is hot to the touch and in need of the cooling touch of the wizard. </p><p></p><p>The runes stand out on the cloth a yellow-gold, almost searingly bright.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter attempts to snuff out the flaming parchment with a few drops of water from his skin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame goes out, but the parchment is scorched beyond recognition.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any nearby container he might use to contain the pieces of the charred sheet.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The table holds some odd knickknacks.  A handknife, a pearl of decent size, a couple coppers, and a strange necklace.  The necklace has a burnished and rust-scarred pendant that lies open.  The pendant is ovoid and hollow on the inside, it looks as if it could carry ashes or something of the like.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is preoccupied at the moment, but the wizard is very perceptive this morning.  He hears screaming coming from the farther down street, from the heart of the village.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves quickly to the door, opens it, and peers down the lane seeking the source of the scream.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue peeks out from the doorway, there are several people running toward the center of town.  Some folks are bringing buckets of water, some two at a time, running towards what Maouelue can see is smoke billowing from somewhere down the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a cursory glance back at his preoccupied friend, he exits and closes the door behind him, then runs full speed down the street directly toward the smoke.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few steps outside the parsonage, a very beautiful young woman locks eyes with you as she's running towards your end of town.  She makes a beeline for the wizard.  As she gets closer, she says, "Are you Maouelue, the man with Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"My name is Kirra, I'm Denson's daughter.  He sent me to find you.  There's been an accident in your room.  We need you or your friend's help, please!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hastens his pace and joins the maiden.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes!  Please come, quickly!"  She takes off toward The Sleeping Sheep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue follows apace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both come around the corner, bumping into more people as the crowd from the other night seems to have just shifted buildings.  This morning, however, no one is in a jovial mood.  They're running a bucket brigade to put out a fire emanating from the side of the Sleeping Sheep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, the budding frost mage, shouts for the crowd to stand aside and immediately begins to channel a ray of frost at the blaze, attempting to contain the outer edges of the fire to prevent the spread.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares intently at the locket, caught between a strange desire to enclose the ashes within the trinket, and a fear of transgression against their healer host.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He reaches out and turns it over idly in his hands.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>We can roll it in beyond or roll20 if you want</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>1d20 = 16 + 6 (wis) + 1 (ring) = 23</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rolls a Wisdom save! (23)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Avrae's back up!)</p><p>Dieter, for a second, feels a psychic pull on his will.  Before he can really comprehend what's happening, the feeling completely fades and he's left staring at the locket, hand outstretched towards it.  You don't quite remember setting it down...</p></div>
