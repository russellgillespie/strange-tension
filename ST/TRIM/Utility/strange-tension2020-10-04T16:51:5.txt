strange-tensionThe farmlands pass to thick dales of grasslands, several animals graze at their leisure.  In sort order a copse of trees comes into view.  Beyond that, much larger and darker trees take over the skyline and the forest proper starts.  An eerie feeling comes over the group as rain clouds, travelling towards the party, appear over the trees.

*Dieter takes note of what kinds of animals are grazing.*
*The group hurries toward the forest in hope of avoiding the rainfall.*
A few cows and sheep.  (Perception for more, if you want.  Who is leading, or are they going side-by-side?  Douglas is behind everyone, we'll say.)

*The group has now fallen into their standard formation with Dieter in the lead flanked by their two companions right behind and Maouelue bringing up the rearguard.*

The cows and sheep have a brand, BSR.
A murder of crows can be seen high on the branches of the trees as the group enters the forest.  There is a piece of bark nailed to the first tree.  Dirt obscures the words scrawled on it.
*Maouelue spies the unusual signage and moves over to brush off the dirt to uncover its markings.*
The message is in common.  *Stay on the path*
You all can now see other writing on the barks of the trees, some scrawled, some written in a dark substance.  (Percep check)


Maouelue starts feeling queasy.  Dieiter gets right up to one of the scrawls.  *Turn back*
Another, written in blood. *She lives this way*
There are arrows in red pointing the way deeper into the trees.
*The group, senses heightened at this unsettling script, moves forward keeping eyes out for both Trix’s domicile and anything that might be lurking in the woods.*


*Dieter pull out a torch and hand it to the...hand.*

*With an eye for the dramatic, the duo perform an unnecessarily magical lighting and carrying of the torch.*
*They each side-eye their companions in search of signs of reverence.*
Douglas stares, open-mouthed.
The Frenchman always looks at Dieter with reverence.  The display does increase it, however.
*Grinning slightly the pair lead on further into the newly lit woods.*



*The others peer tentatively around them, the flames now creating eerie parallactic shadows as they pass through the trees.*
As Dieter says this, a crack of lightning breaks.  The forest is illuminated for a brief second and several screeches are heard from over heard.  A moment later, thunder rumbles.  A darkness settles over the forest with only the torchlight for guidance.  For the moment...
*There is nothing to do at this moment but carry on for the troupe. Their pace  naturally quickens in response to the ominous...omen.*

With the mage hand leading the way (and Douglas in almost darkness), the troupe follows the bloody arrows further in, towards 'Trix' and the incoming storm.  (Another Survival for everyone.)



That's not a valid save.

Dieter whirls around, checking the trees again.  He rolls his eyes, then continues down the *correct* path.
This path diverges from the main forest path.  Tension starts creeping into the bodies and minds of the adventurers.
A peal of thunder.
*The irony of the mysterious merchant’s name only now settles upon Dieter. At hearing the name aloud in this way Maouelue furrows his brows, if possible, deeper than they had already been. His pace falters for a few steps before he resolves to press on.*
*The group hastens their pace in deference to the oncoming storm.*




The party picks up the pace as the thunder rolls.  Tree after tree passes.  The three go deeper and deeper into the woods.
Dieter's eyes are completely focused on the signs, not missing a one.  He thinks.  So far.  (One more survival check, please.)

Dieter lets out an exclamation of triumph...  then horror as a decrepit homestead comes into view.
The other three bump into him as they catch sight of it as well.  

And then the clouds loose a fury.
The deluge starts immediately.  A massive amount of water pours from the sky in seconds.
*With nothing else for it, they book it for the creepy domicile.*
Thunder and lightening crash.  Dieter catches his bearings and just as he's about to run, the illumination from the lightening shows them a figure beckoning them to the structure.  They bolt, splashing through the mud and water into the strange building...
The party stumbles in, almost on top of themselves, into the foyer of an... interesting abode.  From the outside, it looks smallish.  A combination of a ramshackle shed with a colorful peddlers cart with what seemed to be a circus boxcar attached in the rear.  When you enter in, however, you all see a cozy, if earthy, entrance with strange baubles and bobs hanging from the ceiling and in various bowls scattered hither and thither.
A wide set of earthen steps descends to a sitting room set with wicker chairs around a roaring fire.  A table with a bubbling pot stands to the right, no clear source of heat underneath it.  Herbs, fungi, a complete assortment of plants and other particulars are scattered everywhere around the table, and, truthfully, the room in general.  The ceiling is higher in this main sitting area, and no rain is getting through.
