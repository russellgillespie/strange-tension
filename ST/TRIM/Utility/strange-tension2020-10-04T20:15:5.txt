strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>This path diverges from the main forest path.  Tension starts creeping into the bodies and minds of the adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A peal of thunder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The irony of the mysterious merchantâ€™s name only now settles upon Dieter. At hearing the name aloud in this way Maouelue furrows his brows, if possible, deeper than they had already been. His pace falters for a few steps before he resolves to press on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group hastens their pace in deference to the oncoming storm.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The party picks up the pace as the thunder rolls.  Tree after tree passes.  The three go deeper and deeper into the woods.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter's eyes are completely focused on the signs, not missing a one.  He thinks.  So far.  (One more survival check, please.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter lets out an exclamation of triumph...  then horror as a decrepit homestead comes into view.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other three bump into him as they catch sight of it as well.  </p><p></p><p>And then the clouds loose a fury.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The deluge starts immediately.  A massive amount of water pours from the sky in seconds.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With nothing else for it, they book it for the creepy domicile.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunder and lightening crash.  Dieter catches his bearings and just as he's about to run, the illumination from the lightening shows them a figure beckoning them to the structure.  They bolt, splashing through the mud and water into the strange building...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party stumbles in, almost on top of themselves, into the foyer of an... interesting abode.  From the outside, it looks smallish.  A combination of a ramshackle shed with a colorful peddlers cart with what seemed to be a circus boxcar attached in the rear.  When you enter in, however, you all see a cozy, if earthy, entrance with strange baubles and bobs hanging from the ceiling and in various bowls scattered hither and thither.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A wide set of earthen steps descends to a sitting room set with wicker chairs around a roaring fire.  A table with a bubbling pot stands to the right, no clear source of heat underneath it.  Herbs, fungi, a complete assortment of plants and other particulars are scattered everywhere around the table, and, truthfully, the room in general.  The ceiling is higher in this main sitting area, and no rain is getting through.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the left, standing stock still, hands clasped in front of her, is a beautiful young maiden.  Hair as black as pitch, clothes patchworked but otherwise clean and neat, she is a vision save for bits of dirt marring her stark white skin.  She looks to be middle age, but when you look again, she looks to be barely an adult.  She waits patiently for you all to enter, eyes unblinking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he speaks, he subtly examines the young woman, not fully believing the facade she presents. He has seen a hag or two in his days and his arcane senses tingle...or did that last lightning strike come a little TOO near?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, who has always been a bit vulnerable to beauty, unwittingly slackens his jaw. Whatever he had been expecting, this figure is not it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman nods her head.  "M' name is Bellatrix, but the townsfolk call me Trix.  Why do you come so deep into the woods to find me?"  Her eyes, still unblinking, you can see have an odd greenish tint to them.  Unnaturally bright green, reminiscent of firebugs at night or the pallor of a sickly person.  She seems healthy, though.  (Perception check for more.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard doesn't catch it, but Dieter notices Douglas acting very nervous.  He's grabbing his left elbow with his right arm, not making eye contact with anyone, and not looking around at anything.  There is so much to see in this place, it just strikes Dieter as strange.  He also notices several potion bottles ready to be stoppered.  They're red, swirling, and you know them as potions of healing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She laughs, looking at the floor for a beat.  She makes her way to the table, stoppers four bottles, and bring them to Dieter.</p></div>
