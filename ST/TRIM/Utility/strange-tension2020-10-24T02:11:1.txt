There is a bit of a scare when Frenchy slips on a rung.  Other than that, everyone gets down.  The water at the edge of the cavern, at the bottom of the ladder, is only a foot deep.  The henchmen are wading, waiting for the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Henchy brothers each light a torch as they look for drier footing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The water extends before the brothers' torches.  Maouelue can just see the edge of a small island in the middle of the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue drops down the final rung and looks around. He looks around for Dieter but doesn't see him. He takes a few tentative steps toward the center island, pulling out his Quarterstaff to test the depth as he goes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue takes four steps, then the staff registers the floor falls away abruptly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He beckons to the Henchys to follow him and walks around the perimeter counter clockwise to a small just he sees on the East wall. He once again tests the waters as he steps out and gauges the distance to the center. It looks to him like about 20ft at that point. He begins to pull up a large cube of water from the area, hovering it in the air and spinning the 125 cubic feet of water in a mesmerizing ball that flickers reflections of the flames all over the cavern. He slowly begins to extend the water into a long bridge, similar to the one used above ground, this time considering the terrain, he makes it slightly narrower with higher sides to act as railings. He then leads the group across, giving Dieter time to do...whatever it is he needed to do so badly...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy can see, just as the group is about to start across the ice bridge, something in the water.  He clocks it going S to N about ten feet from the bridge.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The pair oblige</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue leads the party backwards away from the bridge momentarily after they throw the torches.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sound burbles, moving past the bridge northward.  It goes past about thirty feet and the group can't hear it anymore.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sends his spirit bat to shadow the shadow.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy makes it over without any problems. (Perception from Frenchy.)  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's bat can't use it's echolocation through the water, but it does clock the sound going northward, then fading, assumedly diving further down.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The little island is made of shale and rough stone.  There is signs of someone or something being here recently.  Signs of a fire, scorch mark are on the ground in a couple places.  Bones litter the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy inspects the bones trying to determine what animal they might be from.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bones are a mixture of human, rat, orc, boar, and lizard-like bones.  Strange scatterings everywhere, but concrntrated around the fire markings.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy hurries back across the bridge to relay his findings, bracing himself against the icy railings to keep his balance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy very nearly slips on the ice, narrowly missing falling into the water.  He braces himself at the last minute.</p><p></p><p>The bat Maouelue tasked to watch the water catches signs of life again, this time closer to where the bridge meets the island.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue telepathically directs it to buzz the surface of the water above the shadow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something jumps out of the water, bites the bat, and brings it under the water.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just before the bat's vision goes dark, the wizard sees...</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sends his mage hand over to where the bat has just been consumed and tries to ready it to lure and pluck the Quipper out of the water should it jump.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A fish tries to jump and bite the hand.  The hand moves to grab the fish.  They both miss.  Frenchy thinks he hears something, farther to the W of the cavern.  He can't be sure, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy relays this info, but Maouelue urges the group around to the northeast passage heading away from the water...for now...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy glances back over his shoulder a few times keeping his eyes on the rearguard.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As the party makes it way to the NE opening, a tail splashes out of the water to make a grab at Frenchy!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tail whips <i>just</i> past Frenchy.  Suddenly a humongous snake-man rears up from the water.  It has a python's head, to beefy arms, a human torso and legs, with a fifteen foot prehensile tail.</p></div>
