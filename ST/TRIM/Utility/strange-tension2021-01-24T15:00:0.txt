strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Random slurping and sipping sounds greet the silence after Maouelue's statement.  Lanrion nods contemplatively.  The witch's eye flit between all members of the party, trying to take everything in.  The guards, who did not sit, stand in awkward quiet behind the troupe.  Daran looks out of place and a bit nervous, while Benna...  is trying to hold in laughter.  Or gas.</p><p></p><p>Lanrion sweeps his gaze around to all, landing last on Maouelue.  "Thank you for your candor, Metal Mage."  He smiles.  "I have had success in enchanting.  And other arcane arts, in truth.  I'm a big fan of history, too.  Did you know, the very place we're sitting used to be the site of a major event in Feywild history?  It's true," he looks seriously around the group.  "It is right here that the Pale Prince tore out his heart.  Some say that, when his love sailed across the sea, with the Queen of Ravens, he clutched his own chest, ripped the heart out of his very body, and buried it in the ground.  Isn't that interesting?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Interesting is quite a word; says everything while fully saying nothing. We keep hearing tell of this Pale Prince as it would so happen. Have a few tomes along with us, matter of fact. Strange we would be led right to the, forgive the punnery, <i>heart</i> of it all so directly.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tell me, is there any part of the story that involves a black ship?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And mind, all of you, pipe in if you wish.” He surveys Benna as he says this.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna is sitting on her hands, rocking back and forth, looking utterly crazy and very much at home.  The rest are in rapt fascination between the two of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Black ship, black heart...  One in the same, yes?  And the pun is forgiven, goodsir.  I wouldn't hold a pun against even my worst enemy.  Now, you were saying about the enchanting.  You need your armor strengthened against...  battle rage?  Or would you just need them to give you a boost to your will?"  (Insight check, if you want!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ahem, well, I had imagined this conversation would be a bit less well-attended, but I'll try to be frank. When the...head gets a rush of blood in the heat of battle, the brain would do well to remain sane. Something to bolster the blood supply...perhaps a boon of intelligence to keep my wits."</p><p></p><p>The mage awkwardly tries to explain himself in front of his company.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The story is a strange one," the wizard fairly wheezes out.  Benna giggles, softly.  "The Pale Prince used to be the Sun Prince, once upon the day.  His love of a follower of his was his undoing.  She eventually turned to love another.  Maybe it was something the Prince did.  Who is to say.  All I know is that outside my balcony, to the southeast, I am privy to his pain.  Every day."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He pardons himself, gets up, and conjures a wizard's laboratory against the wall.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell me, kind woman, what do you know of enchantments?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue looks at the newly conjured workstation...  and it off-put by it.  Not sure why, though.  Something is hitting him as odd.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks back and forth between her party-mates, but Benna gets up and goes to Lanrion's side.  "Oh, my, a bit here, a bit there!  Lessee what ya got, sonny!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard laughs at that and the two set to going through beakers and vials, random bit and bobs from his table.  All with their backs turned.  Bellatrix stares at Maouelue, giving him a look that says, <i>What in the Nine Hells is happening right now?!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans in and whispers a reply. “Apologies dear Bellatrix, i had not sought to tie everyone up with this endeavor, but I felt the need to gather resources before heading out again. Pray, let us watch what your sister and Lanrion concoct here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and says in a whisper, "I'm not worried at all, I can't remember the last time I've seen Benna have so much fun!  He does switch topics quite frequently, though!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Wizards...” He replies with a wink.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tittering comes from the workbench, and the wizard starts mixing things in vials.   Puffs of smoke erupt, and more laughter ensues.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lanrion turns in a flourish, and says, "Dear boy, have you any item - jewelry or the like - very near and dear to your heart?  Not bound to your armor or any weaponry?"</p><p>Benna comes back to the table with a brewed concoction, giggling and staring between Maouelue and Lanrion.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There was, at the start of our journey, a young Halfling called Briffo Lightfoot...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All lean forward, in expectation.  The wizard nods, almost imperceptibly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...when hope was high, our search beginning. There was no ransom to be paid. But, the heists they came at night, as we delved the Muhlen Manor; as we tore the place apart, as they turned our greed to shame. </p><p></p><p>We laid him down by riverside. With words we teared admist our blunders. <i>They took our Brightfoot in his striiiiiide!!!</i> So to the vault, we took our shame.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“But still...I dream he’ll always see, the ways his sacrifice was tendered. He drifts beyond the endless sea...</p><p></p><p>...his life has filled the dreams I dream.”</p></div>
