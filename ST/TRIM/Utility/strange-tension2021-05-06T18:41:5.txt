strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue gets a little dirt off his shoulder and begins to weave, swirling the fog around the room and sucking it into a vortex where it dissipates at the center.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Appearing in the middle of the cleared room is another block of ice, identical to the others.  No frost coats the walls or floors here, this room is rough stone bricks, as that of a castle.  The temperature of this room is very nearly pleasant.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage steps forward, now expecting another place to put his hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue reaches forward, placing his hand on the ice block.  The fog reappears around him slowly, emerging from the ground.  Then he notices the block is no longer in front of him...  and that the fog is swirling around.  The swirls become small eddies, combining, colliding into each other.  In mere moments, the mage finds himself in a vast open space surrounded by five fog elementals!  (Before initiative, please give me a perception check!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There doesn't look to be a way out, at least from your vantage point currently.  The elementals are intimidating, but they are not (as of yet) acting aggressively.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Children of the fog, I am the true ancestor of Albrek. I am here to complete the trials and take my rightful place in this realm. Would you help or hinder this cause?”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They don't speak, but you get the distinct sense that this is one of the tests.  Simple fog-enshrouded weapons appear at each of their sides, and they move into a semi-circle position around the Dragon Mage.  Their red eyes flare momentarily, but they make no response.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue lays down his weapons and sits down in lotus position. He closes his eyes and begins breathing slowly. He says only this, "Discretion."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The fog monsters dissipate and start to coalesce around the meditating mage.  Maouelue feels a pressure building at his nostrils, as if the fog were trying to get in.  He is focused on his breathing, but he holds, contemplating what to do next.  (Breathing in?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He releases hold of his corporeal self, breathing in the fog and meditating on <i>becoming</i> the water, the vapor, the frost, the ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first breath in sends his inner vision blurring through time and space; stars and constellations, planets and their moons, all race by, filling him with awe.  The material world peels away, and after a few more deep breaths, all that exists is fog.  Vapor.  Ether.  </p><p></p><p>The ether forms into a humanoid body, coalesces more into a perfect copy of Maouelue.  It approaches and sits, cross-legged, right in front of the real mage, looking at him serenely.  </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Maouelue.  You have passed the test of peace.  This used to be the penultimate lesson for the dragon mark.  However, the test has been corrupted, Dragon Mage.  Not the whole test, just the ending.  The Prince and his cohort have used their influence to degrade and denigrate the process.  It now does not yield what you think.  It has a solution for you, but it is not what you were hoping for.  The dragon mark is not earned.  It is bestowed.  However, if you are able to defeat the Pale Prince, there might be a way to receive your boon.  Keep on the path, wizard.  You are so close to the conclusion of your quest."</p><p></p><p>With that, he disappears, and Maouelue finds himself back with the block of ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The test of peace, defiled. Yes, that sounds just like what I have heard of this charlatan Prince. I feel sorry for him... If I must be his end... <i>sigh</i>... so be it. Though, perhaps ‘defeat’ need not mean death...more death.” With a heaving expulsion of breath, the mage comes to and re-acclimated himself to his surroundings.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The silence is absolute.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A sullen, frosted voice sounds in Maouelue's ear, saying softly, <i>"That was...  unfortunate.  I was so hoping to meet you without any...  interference.  You are more capable than I presumed.  Find me, if you can.  I'm not far away.  And neither are your friends."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue starts a moment at the proximity of the voice, but doesn’t give in to looking. He takes a steely breath and considers this latest riddle.</p></div>
