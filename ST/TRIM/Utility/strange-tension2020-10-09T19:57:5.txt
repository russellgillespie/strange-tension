strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p><i>Schink schink</i>  Two blades come out.  The first swipe misses badly, but turns out it was merely a feint.  The second hits true, and Dieter feels his limbs goes weak, slack.  His head spins...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But he fights it off and stays in the trees.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The eyes go wide as the last sword slices through the armor, blood flies from the wound.  They look around, at the scene unfolding.  A knowing, even calm, look comes to their eyes.  A flash of metal, the eyes dart to it, then back to Dieter...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The feminine eye smile at Dieter...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The swords strike out, and she feels off balance, lazy.  More blood pours from the wound.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter lets out a primal roooooar of fury as the assassin misses her swipes, and plunges his scimitar right under her jerkin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eyes widen in surprise, just for a second.  Then they go glassy as you see the last breath escape the body.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s rage begins to fade. As he looks at the dead woman, a pang of sadness intrudes before he steels himself to attempt lowering the body down through the bramble wall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you look down, you see inside the walls of the thorn wall.  Bellatrix and Douglas are there, Douglas is wrapped in a gauze of some kind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves his hands in a  sort of air dance as a large transparent hand extends out of his. He sends the mage hand up toward Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The body is guided down.  Halfway down, the swords fall away from the hands.  They land with a soft <i>thump</i> on the forest floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes a look at Douglas and Bellatrix and sees that Maouelue is already heading over to assist in what way he can. Dieter begins scouring the fallen assassin for clues to her origin and anything else that might be useful. He carefully inspects the swords, crossbow, and bolts.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She has a plethora of fun things.  Two shortswords of poisoning.  A light crossbow.  A elven made cloak (Arcana check, or attune to it for specs.)  Her headscarf also gives her advantage on stealth checks.  There are plenty of bolts, none are poisoned yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't really tell what exactly it does, but it does track as magical.  She also has a bandolier about her torso, filled with about fifteen different vials.  All of them are various poisons.  (Intelligence check to see what they might be.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter picks up the gear and begins to stow what he can, then calls out to Maouelue to come over when he has a chance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leather armor is cut through, would need some repairs.  Lastly, she has elven boots (Arcana check or attunement.)</p><p>(Do you take anything off, namely the headscarf?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter begins removing the worn armor and asks Maouelue for his professional opinion on the magical items.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix comes over to you both.  You can see she's come through an opening in the side of the thicket-wall.  </p><p>"If you're done with the body, I would like to move whomever it is into the circle of..."  She looks down at the body, gasps, and puts her hands over her mouth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"This...  This is Veena Muhlen.  She's one of the Five.  She owns the general store with her sister, Hozieh."  She looks shocked, horrified.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a check, Maouelue bends deeply to her head, checking to see if there is any sign of life.  Amazingly, the wizard senses shallow, wheezing breathing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is watching this scene anxiously. He considers for a moment then reaches for the half potion in his bag. He unstoppers it and begins pouring the liquid into Veena’s mouth one drop at a time.</i></p><p>“If she wakes...don’t let her move. Trix...what of our man Douglas?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Douglas is no longer a part of this world.  He has passed on.  I did all I could for him."  She looks back to the grove momentarily, then back to the scene at hand.  "He will be interred here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman on the ground stirs fractionally.  Barely breathing, the blood at least is staunched and color comes back to her face.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash serpentine for a moment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter administers another drop of potion and watches carefully for signs of consciousness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's odd, but she looks better, she's had some of the potion...  She should be up.  Unless she's faking?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vines come out very quickly, surprising the woman on the ground and securing her completely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A beat later, she starts laughing hoarsely.</p></div>
