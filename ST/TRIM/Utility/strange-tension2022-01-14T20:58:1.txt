strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>There are quite a few things here that are ingredients for health potions.  With that check, Dieter can get enough for 2 standard or 1 greater.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We had better take our time here getting ready. Who knows when we'll be able to breathe next." Dieter intones ominously which is met with a gruff acquiescent grunt from Muhlen junior.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sets about his work, thinking back to the priestess of Ilmater all that while ago and of the deadly chase of the Muhlen sisters... <i>Jaecob...</i></p><p></p><p>"I...I am sorry Jaecob. I'm not sure if we've ever discussed what happened...to your...father's favorite daughters..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The map is a detailed crosssection of the underdark, or at least certain strategic locations.  Several cities are mentioned - Menzoberranzan, Earth's End, Gauntlgrym, Blingdenstone, Sloopdilmonpolop - but the biggest one, a section with a giant circle around it, is the <i>Fallen City of Asharladon</i>.</p><p></p><p>The potions are - standard health potion, potion of clairvoyance, and potion of scrying.  </p><p></p><p>Lastly, it's unclear as to what needs to be done with the door, but it looks really solid.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Veena...Hozieh..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shifts uncomfortable in his stance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, them.  Ye kill 'em?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Taken aback at the matter-of-fact tone, Dieter stumbles to a few nods and grunts. "I am sorry."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nah, don't be.  They've been tryin' to kill me for years.  Why else do ya think I'm hiding around down here, gatherin' my own army?  They were always tryin' to take control of the Runemark legacy, along with Wilm.  Shits, all of 'em.  Here's the question, though...  ye sure they're dead?"  He winks at you, goodnaturedly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s uncomfortable shifting takes on a new tone. <i>Could he be sure? Everything was- is such a blur now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I need to get back to the sea.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Not me.  Staying the hell away from there, if I can help it.  I ever tell you about my time with the giants?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go on…”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Where we got our family name from, "The Runemark".  See, my father, that rat bastard, sailed the Sea of Swords all the way across the world.  Legends say he went to Maztica, some say he fell of the side of the world, others mention a portal that took him to the island of the giants.  Whichever way he got there, he got there.  He used to tell us that he was stranded, all of his crew gone, and the giants were about to kill him when he offered them a scroll of wish...  Bullshite if ye ask me, but any way ye cut it, he came back from that situation with the knowledge of giant runes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Those things are inherently magic, and he could have been an artificer or enchanter, maybe even an evoker...  but what does he do?  Writes on lead and copper pieces a rune that turns them into gold!  And it's an illusion spell, so it doesn't actually <i>change</i> anything, just make 'em look like gold!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Rat bastard.  Created a whole business with those coins.  Traded with 'em, built a merchant empire...  No doubt if you head back to the sea, you'll maybe see a few pass through your pockets.  And people are none the wiser.  Not to say they aren't really what they seem, I guess.  But with all of that power, all of that magical acumen, what does he do?  Swindle and rob.  Great legacy, eh?  Now you know why I'd've just traded in the Runemark magic when it passed to me.  Who knows what would've happened if my sisters or brother would've gotten it, though.  Maybe it's for the best."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shrugs and meanders off to look at the 'metal' door.</p></div>
