strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume enter the cubic room, the torchlight illuminating further in.  There is a wooden door at the E end of the N wall.  The dust doesn't stir much as they walk about.  The column is made of stone, not clay.  All four sides have fine ornamentation on them, intricate writing seems to scroll within the ornamentation.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“I have a keen sense that I’m being really obtuse about this obelisk.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has never seen anything quite like this, nor has Frume.  You both get the feeling, looking over the script, that not many alive have ever seen anything like this, either.  As you pour over the intricate tracing, Frume pokes Dieter on the shoulder and says, "Look at that!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>You can kiss me, but never on my cheek</i></p><p><i>You can see me face to face, but never shall we meet</i></p><p><i>We look alike, but not the same</i></p><p><i>When I go away, it is not I to blame</i></p><p><i>In water, glass, or steel, we can touch but never feel</i></p><p><i>We were born on the same day; all the same habits, act the same way</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You are my reflection.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the closest side towards Dieter, the stone turns to liquid, then resolves to a mirror sheen.  First, Dieter can see his own reflection.  Then, the image shimmers and a woman is standing there.  She is human, average height, into her later years.   Her graying brunette hair is held back by a kerchief, and the clothes she wears are vibrant and heavily patterned.  She smiles.  Then a kindly voice enters your head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You may ask me any one question."  She waits expectantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How is my destiny intertwined with these dark serpents, a shadow of the light cast by my miraculous companion?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman cocks her head.  Her eyes sparkle in the torchlight, which seems to not only illuminate the room you're in, but hers as well.  "There are many roads you may travel, however each will lead you to your dark serpents.  The World Devourer waits for you and your companions.  The shadows are not the opposite to Bahamut's Chosen, but an aspect of the Great Dragon's duality, Tiamat.  While the races of elves stem from the various gods, all serpent races, including the Ancients, stem from the Great World Serpent.  At this time, there are those who are trying to open a rift in the material plane for the Great World Serpent.  Yet, there are those who are twisting their minds in order to bring Bahamut's nemesis to Faerun.  If this happens, all may be lost."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles kindly at you.  "Do not lose hope, dear Druid.  You may not have the strength now.  Follow your heart and trust in your friends.  The road will lead you to where you need to go.  Be sure you're learning to be ready for the battle when the time comes."  Smiling, she fades into Dieter's reflection.  Then the stone façade returns to the surface, and the words disappear.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stares transfixed at the spot where his oracle has just disappeared, his mind transfixed on what he has just heard. He stares, motionless, ruminating, stoic.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What happened there?  You see something I'm missing?"  Frume in going all over the column, unable to understand why Dieter's been staring at it intently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s attention is wrested from the column by Frume’s voice. </p><p>“Whoowha???”</p><p>“Oh! Frume. Ahhh, yes um. There was a...sort of vision? I can’t explain. Anyway, it won’t do to dally here. Onward my good man.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That's okay, that's just fine.  Didn't want you completely disappearing on me.  Hey, whatdya say we go try that blue gem again?  If we need to get your gear, we're kinda going the wrong way."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I suppose it can't hurt, now we've figured out how to pry them out. Let's do it!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads back to the gemmed door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok, together this time, right?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh! This fucking thing! Frume, I don't know if it's going to budge..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume gets an crazy look in his eye.  He looks to the door.  Then to the noxious table.  Then back to the door.  He gets down on his hands and knees, checking the bottom of the door.  He says, "Wanna try something?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I can see you're not going to let this go easily. Aye, I'll follow your lead."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Standing and heading toward the pile of bodies.  He tears some strips of cloth and brings them to the table, ushering Dieter over.  "If this doesn't work, or it takes too long, we'll search more."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume starts lighting the strips of cloth and tossing them into the various liquids and such on the table.</p></div>
