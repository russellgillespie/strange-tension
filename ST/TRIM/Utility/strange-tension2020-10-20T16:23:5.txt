strange-tensionTendrils of smoke rise from the smoldering remains of what once was Muhlen Manor.  Between the lightning and the internal fires, nothing remains but small bits of metal, a few crude blocks of stone, and ashes...  and a marble staircase leading to a box of stone, the runed vault doors barring entrance still.  There are many places where the fire even swept into the basement level, clearing out whatever was down there.  Earthen tunnels can be seen routing the earth below the main level, with entrance holes scattered hither and yon. 

As the party approaches the scene, you both notice that getting across will be dangerous at best as there is no bridge or way to access the staircase directly.
*Maouelue considers the distance to the staircase and looks for nearby sources of water.*

There are several puddles from the night prior.  Additionally, just over the next hill is a wonderful pond, just a bit algae-covered.  It's about 250 feet from the marble box.  (By the way, I say it's a box - it's actually a 40ft x 50ft by 20ft tall room.)
*Maouelue gestures for the group to follow him. He leads them around to the pond and alternately uses magic to move water over to the smoldering wreckage then freeze it, crediting an icy bridge over to the staircase.*
*Dieter, catching on, begins to bring hands full of gravel and dirt over to ease the passage on the icy surface.*

*The group smirks at their cheeky method of navigating the embers. It's almost* ***too easy...***
*They make their way towards the staircase, Maouelue lightly chuckling, but Dieter reeling himself in as he sees the dread doors again.*
You approach the doors, everything seems solid, if a bit sooty.
*Maouelue brushes some ash of his shoulder.*
It smears.

*Maouelue winces sheepishly at Dieter.*
*Dieter's eyes roll in exasperation.*
*They approach the vault door and once again take a look at it to see how it fared during the blaze storm.*
It looks exactly like it did before, no marring, no soot.  You can see the sigils better now, in the light of day.
*Dieter does not hesitate. He traces the sigils in the order they have seen in their visions...the circle of runes.*
*Maouelue reaches out and stays his hand....*

*I.  II.  III.  They were all different runes.  All of them are up here.  Maybe the last one on the parchment was a trick, too?  Could it be the fourth the ghost mentioned?*

The runes are in Giant.  Maouelue is having a hard time placing the dialect or the area, but giant runes are naturally magical.
The runes on the coins read 'Runemark'.  The runes on the door are a hodge-podge, it was designed to be that way.  The specific runes in the rooms and on the parchment don't really have a correlation to anything.  You're getting the feeling that the 'runemark' password was a trap.
*They touch the runes I II III IV in order*
The door...  opens majestically.
As it pushes inward, you see a cozily lit study, of sorts.  Bookshelves line the walls, the books covered in heavy leather and looking very old.  There is a massive bear-skin rug on the floor, a considerable trophy of skill and strength.  There are numerous chests in this room as well.  The entire room is lit by what looks to be ever-lasting candles.
*Dieter bristles at the bear display.*
*Maouelue admires the candles, then pulls out the wand of secrets and releases one of its charges, searching for traps or hidden doors.*

*Dieter inspects the bookshelves.*
The wand of secrets pings, points to a corner where a beautiful set of plate armor stands upright.  There is a base where the armor stand could be moved toward the door of the room.  The plate is a burnished steel, but it looks to have oxidized a bit, giving it an interesting black-green sheen to it.  The metal is dull and does not reflect any of the light shining on it. 

The books smell musty but not in a damp sort of way.  They must have been here for centuries, you figure.  (History check for more!)  Maouelue takes down a book or two, inspects them.  They are in a language that is almost impossible to read... as the word never stop moving on the page.  Line after line, picture after picture, the books are a maze of movement.  Diagrams drip between pages, margins are attacked and seized.  There are many books like this.  Although, as Maouelue searches, he does find a few that are able to be read... by a wizard.  (d6 roll, please!)


*Dieter tries to shove the plate armor aside by the base.*
Maouelue can't seem to grasp something in the back of his mind about books with moving words.  He could swear he's heard about this phenomena before, though.
Dieter doesn't catch it either, but for some reason, he's making a connection to a previous book they confiscated concerning the Anauroch Desert.  He can't get more precise that than.
Maouelue finds two readable books.  
*You find a contemporary fiction book entitled A Barbarian's Wind (Collection of love poems).
This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Common Speech. It is simple and straightforward.
This book is worth 20 gps and has 156 pages.*
This feels like a joke, why would this be in here... yet, here it is!  And...
*'The Tao of Earth' - Starts with philosophical musings about the importance of creation and stability over destruction and change. This book is written in an old dialect that most people (even magic users) have trouble reading. It occasionally goes on long-winded philosophical tangents.*
