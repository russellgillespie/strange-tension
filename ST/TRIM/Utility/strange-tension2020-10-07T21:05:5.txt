<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard begins to gather a load of the other materials and meets Kirra’s eye in search of direction to the room of her choice.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh...  Um... Through here.  You can use our gathering room."  She leads you to a larger room guests use as a dining hall.  It's a decent sized common room, with some recessed corner tables you can use to set up shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course, I would be happy to.  Would you like me to bring you anything before I do?"</p></div>
<div class="character-3"><p>@SuoRess</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lady bows herself out.  You are alone in the common room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue continues to gather loads of silver and equipment, arranging them in the corner of the room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares, still captivated by the locket, then suddenly snaps to his senses. His attention turns to Douglas. He leans over and attempts to rouse the wounded warrior.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out one of Trix’s swirling red potions and looks at it curiously. He uncorks the bottle and purses Douglas’ mouth open, then trickles a couple of drops down his throat...hoping...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The liquid is swallowed.  You wait a beat.  And another.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You first see the blood on the bandage recede.  Douglas's eyes flutter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes Douglas’s head in hand and gasps, “My friend!”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He's not very strong yet, holding his head feels like holding a heavy, unbalanced melon.  His eyes flutter some more, then, slowly, they open.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Douglas! Who did this to you my good man?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around the room with his eyes, not daring to lift his head yet.</p><p>"I... didn't see his face.  He came outta nowhere.  Put the knife into my gut.  When he pulled it out, I screamed and...  then everything went black.   How long have I been out?  Where are we?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He was still passed out when I sat down against the Pig to rest my eyes."  He breathes heavily.  "Guess that was a pretty bad idea, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reaches for the rune cloth in his pocket only to recall that it is still in Maouelue’s possession.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What cleric?  Oh, right.  We're in Ilmater's parsonage.  If I could get some water, I think I might be able to try to get up."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands him what’s left of his waterskin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He drinks sparingly, making sure he doesn't over do.  Douglas winces as he sits up, but then looks surprised and takes the bandage off.  Underneath is a gash neatly knitting itself back together, the blood receding as if being erased.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wow! Thank you friend.  Those bottles are better than gold!  So," he says, getting up, "What should we do now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then he remembers he has his mess kit in tow. That should do nicely to gather up the parchment ashes. He dares not leave them behind, so he opens up the tin box and brushes the ashes into the cup before resealing and stowing the box in his pack. He still feels oddly compelled by the amulet, but will not sully the good will of the Ilmater by taking it unbidden. He casts a fleeting glance back at the locket, then says to Douglas,</i></p><p>“Let’s go now and find Maouelue...then break our fast while we consider our next course of action.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas gets up gingerly.  Patting himself down, checking to see his inventory, he frowns.  Then smile abruptly as he fishes out a few coins, drops them on the table.  "Not much, but I hope it'll do.  After you!  Oh, I'll have to stop by my rooms to grab a new tunic, too."  He stoops down to pick up his blood sodden shirt.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They leave the building and begin walking back to the inn as they continue to converse.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, I stay in a barn, southwest of town.  Farmer's real nice.  Since I'm just passing through, I wasn't planning on spending too much money or setting up shop at The Sheep.  I was mainly at the mine most of the time anyways.  If it's all the same to you, I'd like to stick with you guys?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We welcome your company with open arms...and if I could make a casual observation, you seem to have a part to play in this yet. What do you know about those men?”</p></div>
