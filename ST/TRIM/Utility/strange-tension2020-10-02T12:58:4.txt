<div class="character-1"><p>The scimitar slices through the air, rending the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Douglas was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (9) + 20 = <code>29</code>.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>In his rage at seeing his companion crippled once again, Dieter slashes wildly at the goblin, missing horribly in his haste.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas uses his turn to do a medicine check to stabilize Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin roars again, licks his scimitar and walks toward Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He feints as to hit Dieter, but at the last moment, he dodges to the right to try and end Douglas's life.  Douglas takes the blow as a cut across his forearm.  Bloody but still alive, Douglas covers the body of Maouelue as the goblin advances.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, obviously enraged and off kilter, spits on the corpse of his enemy.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter frantically runs over to his fallen comrade and looks imploringly at the man who has blessedly just stabilized his friend.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I...  I think so.  He needs medicine and rest.  I'll bandage as best as I can.  We should get him back to town as soon as possible, though.  What brought you two adventurers down here in the first place?  Not to say I'm not thoroughly grateful, many thanks for your aid here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at you in awed reverence.</p><p>"My name is Douglas.  You've talked with Culver?  They must have known I was missing when I didn't show up at the damned pub, I bet."  He chuckles.</p><p>"Probably the only good thing to ever come of my boozing, I guess.  Well, since you're my rescuers, I might as well share what got me in this trouble in the first place...  First, help me place your friend in a mine cart.  I'd be happy to push it to town."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, overwhelmed by this good news, gasps a bit in shocked relief.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shudders</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I really don't know much about any boss, but we've seen a lot of goblins around the mines lately.  Not sure what's driving them here.  The reason we came is this." He tosses you a coin.  On it are some runes, in a circular pattern. It is finely crafted and the etching was done by a professional. It is a standard silver. However, the markings are unlike anything you've seen before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter examines the coin more closely. He attempts to channel his Druidic origins in search of any memory of such an inscription.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, just then recalls quite how long theyâ€™ve really been in the mine. The initial shock of seeing his comrade fall has now receded, and an overwhelming exhaustion overcomes him. He staggers slightly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hey friend," Douglas says, easing Dieter down.  "I got it from here."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gingerly sets down in a shadowy corner and offers Douglas a torch from their packs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Much appreciated."  He grabs the torch from Deiter and a scimitar from a fallen gobin and sits at the top of the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, feeling exposed, but incapable of caring particularly much about it, blacks out in exhaustion. His dreams are filled with muffled gnashes of teeth and strange languages emanating from shapeless forms...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stirs restlessly, half a wizard eye open while otherwise incommunicative.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers spent their first part of the rest in fitful slumber, but eventually their minds settle and they get the rest they need.  They both wake up alert, rested, and feeling oddly stronger. (I believe you have enough xp to level up?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas sits at the head of the stairs, sharpening his new scimitar with a makeshift whetstone.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The adventurers look to Douglas and ask whether he is keen to push a bit further into the mine, to put an end to this 'Boss' and avenge the desperate souls who lay slain in the chambers above.</i></p></div>
