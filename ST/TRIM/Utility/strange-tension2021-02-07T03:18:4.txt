strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The end of the tunnel looks out over an irregularly shaped cavern, this time with a much larger drop.  Several openings throughout the area have water pouring into a massive pool on the bottom of the cave.  Fammy senses a few things in the water, but can't make out what they are.  Plus, there is steam rising up from the water below.  Which is different, because the water you've been travelling with has been cold.  Stalactites and stalagmites abound in the system, and just before the telepathy gives out, Fammy can see the cave actually dog-legs into a completely new section further on.  It could go on for quite a bit further in that direction, and the rushing water seems to get louder in that direction, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue looks at the group, offering his hand and focusing on Bella.</p><p></p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at Maouelue.  "What, do you have a magic carpet?"</p><p>(Roll20 is up!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes her hand and shouts to the others, “Jump!!!”, then leaping off and pulling Bella with him!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna cackles all the way down, Bellatrix is laughing, completely trusting and at ease with Maouelue's leadership.  Daran... is along for the ride.  A small <i>splash</i> happens as the four enter the water.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins to manipulate the water, pushing and pulling it up and around, dissing out the depth and assessing the footing underneath. He begins to make a large icy path over to the closest “island” rock in the center, aiming to connect as many as he can to traverse the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Each member of the quartet try and reach the bottom, but cannot and have to tread water.  Daran takes a chance and tries to swim down, but he stops fairly quickly as the heat gets uncomfortable almost right away.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are small fish in the water, here and there.  Nothing dangerous, though.  There are also a couple spaces to the east and north where the water is being churned up.  It doesn't look the fish are the reason being the tumult.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They paddle around West as it is the most leftward of all directions. “Let us see what we can of this tumult.”</p><p></p><p><i>Fammy, seek!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The fey bat flies directly overhead the churning spots in the water, trying to make out shapes below, floating across in multiple passes at varying heights.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fammy senses something coming to the surface, or trying to, but can't see anything specific.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fammy also sees four different sections that branch off from the main section.  The dog-leg to the right has some small rapids.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep an eye out while I take care of something here.” Maouelue takes to his ritual preparation changing Fammy into a large toad that plops down into the water as soon as this is complete.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sets up with a bow and nocks it, just in case.  The sisters gather their things in the boat and keep a watch as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bats turns toad, it hops in the water and goes to check on the disturbances.  All it notices are waves in the water, sometimes moving against the eddies and currents, sometimes with.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sorry everyone, I guess it was nothing, but at least we know that now.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s move before this boat gives out. Follow the heat.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They paddle around looking at each passage out and feeling for temperature.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the ice boat floats to the next nearest opening, N, the group sees that stirring of water get bigger and bigger, almost becoming a whirlpool right in front of them.  Just as the churning waves turn the route in front of the pack into very choppy rapids, a being rears out from the depths!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Towering almost to the top of the cavern, dozens of feet in the air, an elemental made of water towers above the party.  (Initiative?  Or did someone want to parlay?!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sisters are in awe.  Daran, ever stoic, raised just one eyebrow.  But the creature only has eyes (?) for the wizard.  (Persuasion check, please, with advantage!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing cocks its head (?) to the side and peers at the quartet in the boat.  It says, "Whssh, whhsssshhh, cssshh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue whispers to the water around him and begins to conjure a likeness from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>An icy blue-white representation of Bahamut now floats in the water in front of the boat. The budding frost mage preens in the gaze of the water elemental.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wall of water lets out a gurgling howl and the water starts swirling around... (roll for initiative!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>WA1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (16) + 2 = <code>18</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Bellatrix was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (7) + 2 = <code>9</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks at the thing.  Then, swearing, pulls his bow and tries to shoot at the thing.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A watery hand comes out of the water and grabs Daran, raising him up and bringing him high overhead towards it's body.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I guess I'm not as e-<i>steam</i>-ed as I thought!"</p><p></p><p>He sends a blast of flame out at the grasping creature's abdomen.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
