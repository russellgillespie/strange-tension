strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sees a well lit hallway made of the same stone as the door; finely crafted and finished stones.  Torches are inset in wall sconces, their low light seems like the sun in this darkened expanse.  You see Maouelue and the snake-person still locked in combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks at the scene and sees Maouelue taking the situation in hand. The druid defers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shields his eyes from the sudden light source, and yells in, "Oy?  You okay in there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maoulue raises an icy hand to the serpent's eyes, then sends out a ray or icy energy to finally quell the evil.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue mutters a prayer to the befouled earth, pulls the serpent's eyelids closed, and rises to look back at his companions.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.  (History checks for symbol, perception checks for the hallway.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The group can't quite lock on to the history of the symbol.  Dieter recalls it belonging to an ancient race of serpents, but the specifics are eluding him.  Maouelue has been in this hall for some time, and he has been soaking up the details.  The torches, oddly, seem recently lit.  There are two doors on the right, two doors on the left, and a large, oaken door at the end of the hall 35 feet away.  The oaken door has a strange looking handle on it.  The ceiling is carved and there are wood beams running lengthwise along the passage.  The doorways on the far end of the two on the right and left sides are bigger and their arches are more ornate.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group takes the money and amulets, but leaves the weapons on the bodies. Maouelue places a silver piece in each of the eight eyes before leaving. They move one door at a time, starting on the first of the left set. The mage tries the handle...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens with a creak.  It pulls open to reveal a small room with a wooden coffin in the middle.  There are no decorations or furnishings other than the coffin.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves in and inspects the coffin looking for any sign of a name or message.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No name or message.  Looks to Maouelue like a pauper's coffin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wood is distressed in places, splintering here and there.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He beckons Dieter to help him lift the lid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lid is nailed down, but the wood is so old the nails don't catch like they once did.  The wizard and the druid are able to get their fingers into crevices and <i>pull</i> up.  The lid lifts off, revealing a clay statue of a snake-warrior, arms crossed over their chest.  A clay depiction of a scimitar is as if it were in the warrior's hip scabbard.  The eyes are gold bits, but they look too small to be standard currency gold pieces.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They lower the lid back down and move across the hall to the opposite door for a similar inspection.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find the exact same thing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Sensing the pattern, the group moves to the back right room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is a larger room that the last, the archway has some words written in snake-ese.  The door pulls open to reveal a coffin, slightly smaller that the other two.  There are reliefs on the walls depicting snake-men using magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two magic users slow and take their time inspecting the reliefs, carefully examining the magical effects being represented.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The depictions are of destruction magics, vile and ancient.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes out his sketchbook and begins drawing a facsimile of the two murals. While the wizard draws his strokes, Dieter has Frumious assist him with the next coffin lid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This statue is smaller and is clothed in what used to be fancy purple robes.  Tatters remain.  The hands are crossed and there is a silver ring on the hand resting on top.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter steps back, considering this a moment while he pulls out a red bottle and pulls the cork with this canines, spitting it into the corner. He lets out a sneering hiss at the statue as he pulls back and lowers the contents down his gullet, wincing slightly and shaking his neck and shoulders.</i></p></div>
