<div class="character-1"><p>He nods and runs toward the tavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shuffles toward the Inn entrance and cracks the door open to peek in on how Maouelue is faring.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees the keen look on Dieter’s face and hurries back to the entrance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The crew shuffles their mine cart and sundries to the room. Dieter and Maouelue tell the henchmen to stand guard over the cart while they inspect Culver’s.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a crowd now outside, pitchforks and a couple machetes are wielded.  They usher you to Culver's shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Named Cork and Tow, it sells fishing and farming supplies.  There are wood planks over the front windows, the storm shades.   It has not been storming.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blank looks look back at you.  One peeps up, "Saw him last night, he was at The Pig."  Some yells of assent.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The front door is ajar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party moves in and begins to investigate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party enters in one by one to a room of chaos.  What was treated with love and care has been torn apart, piece by piece.  Detritus litters the floor, shelving is knocked over.  Large casks of some oily substance have been broken over, the contents seeping over what is now refuse.  The walls have been gouged by implements of some sort, leaving long gashes throughout.  At one time a quaint metal candle holder hung from the ceiling, now it hangs askew, almost touching the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several people try to peek in, you hear gasps and hurried voices from behind the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p><i>They ask Douglas to keep the townsfolk out of the scene of the crime and suggest that those willing fan out and keep an eye around the perimeter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods and goes to do crowd control.  (Inv checks for Dieter and Maouelue.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is just too much going on in this room.  (Give me another for each, just for fun!  If you want to focus on something else, too, let me know.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>Dieter moves toward the back of the shop looking for any additional rooms or crannies.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deiter is starting to think that maybe an animal got in and got loose on some things.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue, closing his eyes, starts to tap into the Weave to give him some insight into what happened in this humble shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In his mind's eye he starts to see ethereal, hooded figures move around the room, as if searching for something.  There are several figures behind the counter area in violence with a darkened figure on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a hulking figure that comes in some time later, from the back, tears through the place, and grabs the figure on the ground by a leg.  Tossing the shape over its shoulder, it lumbers out the back again, the rest of the figures follow.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is now a cacophony of noise coming from outside the shop.  Douglas is not doing a great job on crowd control.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd disperses, but reluctantly.  Many faces turn back over their shoulders, trying to glimpse what is happening.  Seeder remains behind a bit, but his father pulls him away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter motionlessly watches Seeder recede, until at last he disappears around a corner. At that instant Maouelue beckons the group silently to follow him off the street and around the back of Culver’s shop.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The other two men nod in acknowledgment and follow straight way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue nods in assent and they head off toward the inn taking care to obscure their progress as much as possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You make it to the Sleeping Sheep without being seen, you believe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head in and apprise the proprietor of their intent to grab a few things and quickly leave again so that he shouldn’t be bothered fixing anything up for the crew.</i></p></div>
