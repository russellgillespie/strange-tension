strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers try their hands at the ornate chest.  There are no thieves' tools, however the men find a few bits and bobs that could work.  Alas, they do not.  The lock is still in place, but there are no traps.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They look around for a key</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tosses one of the rune coins they carry into the gold ones.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The coin <i>clinks</i> on the top of the pile of gold.  A weird bass <i>kathump</i> is felt more than heard.  Nothing else happens.</p><p>(Investigation check for the key!)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes the branch from the corner and attempts to lower it into the coins.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets a very deep sense of earth, soil, trees, a jungle.  The staff touches the coins.  Nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He packs the staff away and tries to dump one of the coin cheats over.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Umm...dieter, can you help me with this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks at Maouelue, then shrugs and pulls out his mirror.  Looking into its depths he sees a mustachioed man dragging a cigarette wink back at him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The image begins to split in deuce as out emerges Frenchy and Stenchy, the stinky henchmen.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy let’s out a belch.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy twirls his moustache and takes a drag on un cigarette.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue chuckles at the odd scene and beckons the Henchys over to help with the chest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Y'all start spilling <i>left and right</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is curious about the bottoms of the chests. Whether they seem...solid, and whether the coins ring as expected when hitting the floor. Dieter takes a closer look at the staff on Maouelue’s back in the meantime. He sometimes likes to disengage like this when Maouelue is on one of his arcane inquiries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bottoms of the trunks are normal, typical wear and tear.  They seem like they've had water damage at some time or other, but nothing to hurt the solidity of them.  The coins do make a leaden thump instead of a ring, which is strange for gold.  You might expect that with silver, or even copper.   Gold pieces, though, usually have a bit more metallic clang to them.  These do not.  As for the staff...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>This the Staff of the Baobab.  (To get it's properties you'll have to roll a 20 on arcana or attune to it.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a powerful magical item, Dieter definitely gets that vibe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy pulls out his mace in a swaggering gesture, waggles with it for a moment like a golfer, then takes a two-handed swing with it, right at the lock.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The second iteration of Dieter's French henchman <i>wails</i> on the lock, breaking it in one shot.  The top is slightly askew now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gives it a cursory pull to see if it will open yet.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It opens wide, and there are some interesting things in there...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A bevy of weapons and items greet your gaze.  A longsword sheathed in a gorgeously made scabbard.  A set of bracers with Giant runes emblazoned all over them.  A plate helm with a rime of frost on it.   A mace that glints mischievously.  A silver ring with rubies inset in a cross lies on the floor of the chest, as does a beat up looking piece of lead... with 'Runemark' inscribed on it in a circle.  Lastly, a shield with the visage of a dragon being ridden by a wizard is attached to the underside of the chest's top.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter picks up the shield and tests its balance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group takes a short while to sit and consider the items they have found here. The henchmen take a look at the helm and mace, Dieter looks at the bracers and shield, and Maouelue looks at the ring and staff.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue passes the sheet of parchment around as they do this.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As they go about the equipment, they lay it all out on the ground so as to make an outline of the wearer, shield on the right, sword on the left with a bracered arm and scabbard hung low, the helm facing upward, the mace hung opposite the scabbard, and the ring, just where the hand might poke out from behind the shield in combat.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The Staff of Baobab is special.  It can only be used by a druid.  When inserted into soil, a great baobab tree grows (you can decide the height & look).  The tree bears only two pieces of fruit per growth.  This fruit, when consumed, heals 1 disease and does 8d4+8 healing.</p></div>
