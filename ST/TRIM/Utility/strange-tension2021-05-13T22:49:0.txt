strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>The magical bow seems to draw in all of the spectres as Maouelue does the string, it‚Äôs very wood grain glistening a pearlescent aura, blinding. As he releases the nocked arrow, all of the light from the bow and room together  streams into it, tracing across the room in a trail of stardust. The pitiful Prince‚Äôs darkness complete, he sees not his fate arriving. It strikes in the hollowest point of his decrepit being, the heart, piercing the failing globe, whistling an ancient dragonsong in the shimmering acoustics of the room, holy overtones of divine retribution singing the end of this pestilential source. As the arrow strikes, all becomes silent. A low howl begins to swirl and erupt from the deep recesses beneath the frozen facade, wretched now in the gloom, sundering the very ground beneath him as he falls, shattering into a million icy crystals, melding with the frost around him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a massive creaking sound as the Prince first falls, then shatters.  A definitive chill seems to lift, warmth coming back into the chamber from some unseen source.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ice knives holding the sisters melt into the floor, releasing their bodies to the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A long low breath releases from the very depths of Maouelue‚Äôs diaphragm, one he had perhaps been holding their entire time in the Feywild. An ancient anxiety, at last quelled and resolved. He takes a moment to recover himself, then dashes to the unconscious sisters and begins applying his life sustaining magicks to stabilize them.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The cracking sounds resound around the cavernous room.  The source seems to be coming from under the trio.  Also, the crystalline object at the head of the room is starting to melt, uncovering a onyx black gem under the frost.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue quickly ministers some rudimentary aid and sloughs the ladies up onto Jerry‚Äôs back before moving briskly to retrieve the gemstone. </p><p></p><p>‚ÄúTake care of them Jerry! We‚Äôll be moving on in just a moment.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue moves closer to the onyx gem, and it is as large if not larger than himself.  Standing 7 feet tall, about 3 feet wide, and jagged all over, it looks to be more than the mage can handle, physically.  (Arcana and history checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Stress and concern for his friends overwhelms Maouelue's senses, closing him off from his arcane wisdom, however he does remember two things in the tumult - Aenier requested the crystal be destroyed, and there is supposed to be a portal in this room that links to the throne room of the Queen of Air and Darkness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, not quite ready for such an encounter, moves back to his direly injured friends and priorities their well-being for the moment. He works with Jerry to take them back downstairs to the tree room, also curious about its condition now the Prince‚Äôs magic has been rent.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wolf deftly maneuvers the spiral stairs, knowing the precious cargo on his back. At the bottom of the staircase, the frozen frost giant has toppled, leaving bits of giant scattered hither and yon.   The base is still intact, and there is a trapdoor where the giant would be standing.  In the tree room, the massive limbs are thawing, ice water is dripping from the trunk in thick rivulets, pooling on the stone floor.  The floor, Maouelue notices, is lined with small cracks and s lacking much of it's frost rime.  The castle shakes again, ominously.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Seeing the peril they are all in, Maouelue scarpers his plans of getting any rest right now. He looks at the tree, hopeful, yet cautious. He seeks to quickly but carefully take a cutting from one of the livelier branches with a thought to graft it later, hopefully saving the majestic giant in one way or another. He then moves to take a cursory look at the trap door, pulling it up.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It <i>CRACKS</i> from long being iced over.  (Roll 2 d100s please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Within the space inside the base, three items can be seen.  A small keg gilded in gold, a large book that looks to be made of pure ice, and a small, round ball of ice, perfectly spheroid.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Somewhat nonplussed by the curious objects, he takes a brief moment to stow them in his Bag of Holding ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and prays that the ice doesn‚Äôt melt too readily. </p><p></p><p>‚ÄúCome on Jerry, back up the well...‚Äù</p><p></p><p>He leads the ramshackle crew back into the fallen prince‚Äôs lair. Stepping to the dark gem, he wields the Mace of Reduction.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a warmup swing.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He tentatively bats at the gem, perhaps not fully committed with his party in this state.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shaking himself off, he lines up again.</p></div>
