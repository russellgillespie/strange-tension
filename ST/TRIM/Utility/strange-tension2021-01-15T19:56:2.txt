strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The group sees the black sludge RISE UP out of the muck, into a humanoid-ish shape of eyes and goo.  It tries to smash down on the group...  but just misses!  The horn blares suddenly, off to the right of the group.  It pulls Erifias' head around just enough for them to lose balance.  Daran rescues him just as they're about to fall, and now both Daran and the eladrin are 15 feet behind Maouelue.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The edge of the bog appears ahead of the trio.  Just a few more feet and they'll be beyond the black sludge and be able to continue...   That's when the horn blares triumphant and the drums beat viciously.  Emerging from the forest, knocking trees over in the process, is a horde of goblins.  Some are atop wargs, some even ride an ogre or two.  But the main group ride a contraption that, in one, looks to be a wagon turned into a siege machine.  It towers over 20ft tall, and, strangely, doesn't seem to be pulled by anything.   Thick gouts of black smoke erupt from behind it as it's propelled forward...  right at the group!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue from his slightly more advanced position, turns around and begins to speak. His feeling of kinship with the people and the lands here ever growing, he breathes deep and channels the newfound energies from his recent reverie.</p><p></p><p>Metal clad arms perform spirals in the surrounding air. Blue-white begins to emanate from his Platinum Shield of Disruption and Sword of the Mists. Lights begin to glow from the Triple-Triumvirate he carries, each of the nine platinum orbs now shining with a crystalline azure, a faint twinkle of starlight permeating each from within. They begin to orbit Maouelue in atomic arcs around his torso, centered on the innermost light of his spirit, the protagonistic protons of his person. Faint trails of icy blue dust are left behind by each of Maouelue's Mettalicomets as they bend and dive around him. </p><p></p><p>Eyes glowing deep within the Frostbitten Helm, he sends forth three of the orbs, their light tails elongated and bending with the fae light surrounding them as the streak into their targets, the lead warg and ogre-riding goblins, and straight into the center of the onrushing chariot.</p><p></p><p>"Star of Bahaumut guide my Light into the heart of the darkness corrupting these lands!"</p></div>
