Down below, Dieter holds his hand to the shrinking trunk, grabbing two fruits deftly from the branches as the staff reconstitutes itself. Then all of a whirl, the staff continues shrinking and Dieter shrinks with it!</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>Lizard (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 15 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dietard flicks out his long tongue and scampers about, finding a footing along the edge of the floor and wall, then begins climbing silently upward.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the Dieter-lizard moves upwards through the cavern, the sounds on wonder echo down to him. The group waits patiently, cheering the druid upwards.  About 50 feet up the wall, Dieter disturbs some bats perched upside down, causing him to shift and scrabble. (Dexterity save, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There is a moment where you feel like you're falling.  You grasp out with your arms and legs, scrabbling and slapping at the wall.  Suddenly you're moving downwards and, at the same time, remember you have a tail.  The tail whips and catches on a random vine growing out from the dirt wall, and you are able to catch yourself enough to continue climbing.   After your heart calms down.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>(Maybe next time ðŸ˜„) </p><p>Dieter-lizard climbs the rest of the way up without issue and joins the rest of the group, cheering on their leader.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>(The newest member is saving the day on this one!)  Everyone is busy looking at the damage and looking for a way out, they don't see the eyes in the window on the N side of the building.  Quenchy does, though!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks out of view of the window then touches his ring, fading...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a rustling as whatever was at the window takes off in a hurry.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The rest of the crew continues around their respective sides of the building, Dieter trying to see where the fleeing form is headed.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter nears the window, he can make out several campfires going, several remnants of others now amber coals on the ground.  There sounds like a lot of people milling about a distance from the barrow.  In the dark its hard to tell the exact distance, though.  He approximates about a quarter mile off.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He rushes back into the barrow, changing shape as he does and hurried to tell the others to regroup and flee to the south. This outlet is clearly being watched.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group clambers over the stone debris, what's left of the barrow, and flees to the S.  (Moving speed?)</p></div>
