If you sway them, they will turn.  They're only working with the Runemark because he promised them an uprising.  If you give them something else they want, they'd turn to you, surely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Your own spin! That’s rich...that woman was in pieces before...before you. That was more than lycanthropy friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A mage, learned in the necromantic arts, I don't deny it.  Cast out from society and every place of learning I've ever attended, though.  All I ever wanted was to make my mark on the world.  We're very close, to tell the truth."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We?...Close?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"My family.  We are legion.  And we are very close to our goals.  With the Runemark leading, people will be reminded of our kind.  Too long we've lived in the shadows.  Too long have we scrounged on the fringes of the world."  There's a glint now in his eye.  He's very proud speaking about his 'family'.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep talking; Stay alive.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, yes.  What do you want to know?  The Runemark," he shudders, "is a nasty man who has taken steps to take over Oakhurst.  They're been sewing seeds of discord, saying you've stolen from him.  He's reclaimed his marked coins and the silver at the Inn.  He's taken his rage out on the people of Oakhurst, they go missing day by day.  Culver was just the first.  He says you and the druid were the ones to set the snakes loose on the town, too."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And so you and your...horde...eat these lies like the feces they are and that are your kind’s diet? We set out to <i>save</i> Oakhurst from him and his ilk.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And you with your...special interest...an outcast you say? shunned you say? Yet you would have me believe you could lead me to them and convince them to sway?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I can and will, if you let me go.  I can bring one to you, if you'd wish.  You've only been in the area for around a tenday.  The Runemark has been at his games for years."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Give me my dagger.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares back, irresolute...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue nods.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Dieter stumbles over and takes one hand on the dagger with Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both thrust the blade through the mage’s forehead, sparing a retch as the sick crunch resonates in the tight tunnels.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Maouelue feels a twitch in the back of his head.  It feels like a shiver, it travels down his spine and nestles in his chest.</i>  [Alignment changes to Neutral Good]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes a moment to inspect the black dagger, pulling it from the necromancer's skull.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a moment to sanctify the body.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter nods, then moves over to the henchmen. He jostles them awake and they all come to with a start as they see his eye, keen as the day staring at them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Begrudgingly the henchmen agree, exchanging dark looks. Quenchy proffers a cigarette and pointedly doesn't offer any around.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They tidy up what there is of the forge and pack their things, taking as much of the gold and platinum as can be carried in the bags of holding and on the packs of the henchmen. Spare gear is distributed amongst the party, balancing the load and making ready for what is to come.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger (not to go pass that up, sorry!) glows like a black light, a white halo surrounds is as it's removed from the dead man's head.  The halo glows bright and abates.  Whomever is holding it can feel him pulse like a heartbeat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party gets ready to leave as thunder starts rolling.  All can hear it reverberating around the cavern.  The group can see lightning flash as they start climbing the baobab tree.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The four adventurers make it up into the destroyed barrow without major incident.  There was a moment when Quenchy, after looking down, was a bit disoriented and slipped backwards on the vines.  Stenchy valiantly stopped Quenchy from falling too far, though.</p></div>
