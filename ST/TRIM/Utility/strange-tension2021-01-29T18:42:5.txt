strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>"I am called The Dragon Mage, though perhaps I do not know why. My kinship with the Lord of Dragons was at first a bit of fancy, a delusion of grandeur perhaps. Yet, he opened himself willingly to me and has been my guide ever since. </p><p></p><p>I pretend not to know of the depths of your ancient rifts and strife. I only know that my cause is just and I seek not to usurp, but to unify! Let no soul who would aid the causes of righteousness be turned away for ancient prejudice! Let us rally as one nation united across the realms to beat back the forces of Death and Darkness! Let the full spectrum of light, the infinite chroma, shine throughout all lands!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stands up slowly, looking down on the mage.  Not in anger now, but fear.  "Answer me this last question.  What is your surname?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I..."</p><p>"I know not."</p><p></p><p>Saying these words out loud trigger a desperate search in Maouelue's....Lumao's mind. His amnesia coming in fits and spurts...lost words...lost memories...he clings on to his old name in his mind, trying to piece it together....</p><p></p><p>...for naught.</p><p></p><p>The answer is not forthcoming....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He now rises up, turns around and begins rummaging through his things, digging relentlessly for something.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Tucked deep within the pages of his torn diary, he finds what he is looking for. An old note. An undelivered message. Unread out of honor and duty, but now...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>It would seem the truth would finally have to be out, though he is reluctant to reveal these personal tidings to all, there really is nothing left for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He proffers Shi'Vandos' mesage for Shi'Veilan to the Queen.</p><p></p><p>"These are the words of my Father, intended for his...other son. <i>Brightshine</i>... Of mine own name, I remain yet ignorant....uninformed...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It begins with Lumao...or at least that's what I can remember. Perhaps, Majesty, you might do me the honor of filling in the rest...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He genuflects again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The soldier comes in with a book, and the Queen takes it from him, sets it on the table.  She puts a hand out in front of the kneeling man, says elven works.  A warmth spreads over the mage, quite the opposite feeling of her previous magics.  After a few moments, she lifts the mage up to standing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the room at large, she says, "Continue to prepare.  I will be back shortly." </p><p>Then she says to Maouelue, "Follow me.  There is something you need to know, friend of elves and dragons."  She is smiling now, quietly, softly.  She walks to a side room where a table and several bookshelves line the wall.  She's brought the book the soldier gave her, and she sits at the table, offering Maouelue the other lone chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Queen Titania opens the book, flipping through until she stops at a page.  She turns the book to face the wizard.  "Do you recognize this symbol?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your surname is Albrek.  Shi'Vandos was a high mage that came to the Feywild well after his family was banished, one of the high hopes of Oberon."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"These dragonmarks...  they are aberrations in the fabric of reality, Maouelue.  Some say they are a birthright, given at specific times after specific deeds are done.  Other say they spontaneously occur, being as brands on the skin.  I will ask you, although you can decline showing me...  Is this mark anywhere on your body currently?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Astonishingly, the mage realizes he cannot answer this question in full knowledge of the truth. Something about her way and line of questioning seems to drive right at the heart of his uncertainties, almost in a knowing, motherly sort of way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If it would not offend the Queen..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He makes to disrobe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us find out together."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He begins to doff his armor, laying the pieces out ritually as he does, akin to back in Oakhurst. As the metal peels away, he feels the warm sweaty undergarments articulated by the open air, chilling slightly. Piece after piece he bares himself fully to Titania.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he is taking his clothing off, just before he gets to the...  erm...  personal bits, he remembers something in speaking with his father.  Something of the trials.  Something about a birthright...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...<i>the circled key</i>...”</p><p></p><p>The words leave his mouth as if spoken by another, his form entranced in this astounding, yet serene, scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen pulls back a bit, visibly.  "So, you're aware of this?  It does not look like it's on you at this moment..."  She leaves the silence to speak the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the ice in the mountain...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the Frozen Tears...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the Prince...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...”</p></div>
