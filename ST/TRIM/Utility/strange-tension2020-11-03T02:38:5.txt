strange-tension*The troupe now convened at the oaken door, where Maouelue raises the hilt of his sword and bashes it into the center, knocking hard three times.*
It sounds loud.
*The two roguish types pull at the handles instead, shaking their brows mildly.*
Locked.  (Perception check or strength check to force the door.)




The ceiling creaks and suddenly *cracks* releasing the massive wood beam.  It comes barreling down, catching *everyone* by surprise.  It drives through the party and into the door, smashing it and bringing the whole lot with it.
*Maouelue is brought to for a moment, his newfound zeal having gotten the better of him.*
The group is bodily thrown into the next room, they are knocked down prone.
As the party gets to their feet, they are greeted by another torch-lit room.  It's oval in general shape, 35ft side to side, 20ft deep, with a small alcove to the S  (The door you came through is on the W).  On the N wall are three wooden coffins, similar to the ones you've seen before.  There is a *much* larger coffin on the S side, just N of the alcove, running W to E lengthwise.  The torches flicker.
*Dieter and Maouelue walk over to the three small coffins to inspect.*
There are paintings on these, snake-men-warriors in gentle repose.  The coffins look better made than the ones in the other rooms.
*They open these as well.*
They open onto the same clay statues as the rooms prior.
*Maouelue moves over to the large coffin and inspects it while Dieter hangs back.*
It is a bit more well made, thicker, heavier.  The wood is in better condition.  The picture on t he front is of a huge looking snake-man with a long tail instead of legs, and two massive arms.

The reliefs tell of some battles between an ancient race of serpents called Naga, and their elven, human, and dwarven enemies.  These depictions show the Naga as heroic vanquishers of the humanoid races.  (More in a sec.)
As the short rest wanes, you receive a rush of emotion as you connect with the silver ring.  It is a device made by the Naga, a weapon of sorts.  If you put it on, you can retain a particular skill the Naga possess.  It would transform a part of your body into a serpent appendage, giving it the ability to deliver poison damage with an unarmed strike.  Maouelue feels dread and a sense of warning, but at the same time, emanating in waves from the object, he feels a great sense of power and righteous anger.
*He hands the ring to Dieter.*
*Dieter takes the ring and turns it over a few times, taking his own read on its energies.*

The sense you get from the ring, tapping into the Naga-created object, pushing into the understanding of the types of beings these serpents were...  Dieter is pummeled by a barrage of emotion, mainly vengeance.  Anger and pain war within him as he senses the motives of the Naga.  These beings are pure hate and atrocity.  They wanted nothing more to see the world burn and be recreated by their serpent gods.  Magical items they made for themselves are extremely powerful.  Those left for whomever might find them have...  secrets.
*Maouelue gestures to the center of the room. The group makes to gather coffin tops from all the rooms and place them out end to end in a long sort of platform arrangement.*
*As the other two get on with this arrangement, Maouelue attempts to lift the clay statue in the first room on the left they entered.*
*He attempts to lift and drag it back to the oval room.*

The clay statue starts to slip...

He catches it *inches* from the floor.

With some effort, the two safely bring it back into the larger room.
*The three companions continue bringing all the rest to the platform they’ve constructed.*



All of the clay statues are now in the large room.  None have cracked or are broken, save the one the ring was taken off of.
*He gestures to the final coffin.*


*Maouelue tries to free a hand and steady Frume with a divine word.*
*Dieter sneezes and grumbles something that sounds suspiciously like “pious poser”...*
*The clanking metal from the cleric’s gesticulations prevents him from hearing this.*
A fifteen lifts it, but just barely...  Muscles tense and flex in Maouelue and Frume's arms, your whole body is taut moving this coffin.  The wood is probably petrified.
The stink that comes from the coffin is horrendous.  Like dead fish and stagnant ocean water mixed with rotting snakeskin.
The lid is *slowly* moved off of the coffin, revealing a horrendous looking snake-man.  Muscled and sinewy, with two large arms and stacked torso, it has a python-like mantle on it's head.  It's lower half is that of a large snake, complete with rattler on the end.
*Doeter takes out a length of rope and ties the mouth shut, shuddering.*

Dieter looks at the thing and starts to wrap his rope around the thing's mouth.  He could swear he heard a rattle...  but maybe it's just his nerves?
*Dieter quickly wraps up the knot and draws the blade end of his staff, pointing it at the snake man and quivering.*
