<div class="character-0"><p>"Flippin flipper's flippers!!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yeeouuuuch!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whassamatter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The sooner we get out of this magic hell, the better. We've got to get to the coast. My energies dwindle..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm all for that.  Here, take these."  He hands you the potions of healing.  "Lets get up that ladder in the other room.  We should be directly underneath the guards room now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok. I'll need to drink some of this now."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There ye go, lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaahhhh...That's getting there."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank ye kindly good man."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I guess we'll just hold on to this other one for a bit until we find out what it is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  Lest ye be turned to a goat!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They pack up the equipment and head back over to the ladder. Dieter has changed out his dagger for a shortsword and donned the chain mail.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Eh Frume...I know my stuff is up there, but do you think we had better clear this place before heading up? You never know what we might find and that just might be the advantage we need up there, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"True, true.  But who knows how big this place is.  It's all over the place, I can't get a read on it.  Not to mention whoever was dissecting those bodies.  Rather not meet them without a bunch o' fighters at my back, I'll tell you true."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You make valid points there. Seems I've got a bit o' the lust as well! Well my good man, why don't you head up first, in case you recognize anyone?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sounds like a plan!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frume puts a hand on the ladder, two humanoid shapes appear out of nowhere and move to attack!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Die you son of a bitch."  Frume stabs down and the shadow fades away, silently screaming.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter spits at the shady corpses. "There will be no dying of the light today."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wooo...  boyo.  I'm not feeling so well..."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume doesn't pass out, but he puts his hand back on the ladder to steady himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Time for me to help <i>you</i> friend. Let's head back to where we found the chest and take a moment to recover before we go further."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter offers a shoulder to lean on and helps support Frume back down the corridor to the secluded space by the small chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He tries to close the door behind them and find a way to secure it from opening. He considers a moment, then reaches in his pocket and pulls out the latent gem. He smirks, then pushes it into the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume leans on you and you feel like you're going to collapse as well.  (Strength save, please.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter falls to his knees under both the dead weight of Frume and the strength drain he's suffered as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whoa, whoa, lad.  Here, looks like we're both feeling low.  Let's just rest here."  He sits propped up on the nearest wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye..I...Aiiieee...agree..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leans back and succumbs to the weariness.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume, who's been sitting and honing his new shortsword along with checking out the makeshift forge, eyes Dieter waking.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hoy, there.  Feeling any better?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, just a bit... How about you? You took the brunt of that."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"Agreed. Go on and head up and I'll be right behind you."</p></div>
