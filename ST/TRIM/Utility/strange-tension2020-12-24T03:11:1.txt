They won’t expect an attack from within, and if I were a betting elf, I’d say they won’t expect me to go back down in a hurry... Nevertheless, we should take caution. If only there were some way to draw out their forces, draw any of the guard away from the halls within...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix starts at this last from Maouelue.  "But, isn't that what we are proposing already?  Bringing a force in front of them, drawing them out?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I must admit, I am torn. If this is indeed the place, then I fear it will only grow stronger with every passing moment. What of magical means? Could we not cause some sort of disturbance of another sort? One that does not risk the will and loyalty of others? And most importantly, one that does not take so much to time! To think, that I was to lead us <i>away</i> from the place! No, I fear if our man is caught in that dread place, I dare not delay any longer, lest all hope be lost for his redemption.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group ponders.  Bellatrix sits up on her couch, Vam paces near the entryway.  Heston is meandering, taking in the strange ambience of the witch's home.  Daran sits on a side chair, eyes closed, deep in thought.  Worry lines wrinkle his usually serene face.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds turn to minutes.  The silence, and worry, deepens.  Vam starts to say something, then shakes his head and stops.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, there is a soft knocking at the front door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lightning hits, thunder rolls, outlining the doorway with an electric white light.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks up, peers around the room at the others.  Saying, "Excuse me," she gets up and heads toward the entry.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She grips the handle, and swings the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another strike of lightning outlines a hunched figure.  When the color comes back to the world, the group sees an old, grey-haired woman, wearing worn travelling clothes and carrying a carpet bag over a forearm.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix gasps.  "Sister?"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The blue glow permeates everything.  A pulse beats, intensifying the miasma around Dieter.  He cannot see or feel anything except for his own consciousness within the glowing blue-grey fog.  </p><p></p><p>A white light descends from above.  It is small, even as it gets closer to Dieter it doesn’t grow at all.  This silver-white ball of light stops what seems like inches from the druid, and words emanate in the void.  “Thank you for your trust, Druid.  I fear I may have inadvertently scarred your friend as well.  I will try to make this as brief as I can.”  The ball of light morphs into the visage of a wizened man.  All of his features are tinged blue, but Dieter gets the sense that he is an old human, and his robes suggest a wizard or scholar of the arcane.  </p><p></p><p>“My name is Lord Alezander Muhlen.  I have been entombed in this… place for many decades.  Originally I had heard rumors that this place was the center of Netherese lore.  Upon my arrival, I found illithids making this their base and… reaping the legends of our forefathers.  To my great consternation, they were much more powerful that I could have imagined.  They captured me, tortured me for information.  Finally, they entombed my body in one of their stasis-pods.  Possibly for further experimentation.  You need to free me.  I am lost in here.  However, I can give you a general direction to where I am. Follow the light I can provide, be wary of the illithid warriors, and we will stop their foul plot upon our lands!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"One -I am both.  A bargain was made a very long time ago with the forefathers of our forefathers.  In return, I was to see their glorious light brought back from the brink of annihilation and render up unto them the dregs of this world.  They were to reign again, and I was to be their ambassador.  It may still be, yet.  The torch has been passed, as they so colloquially say.  The time may yet come to fulfill the terms of our agreement.  The Great World Serpent may yet draw breath upon the Material Plane.  And, if it does so, all humanity will fall under their carnage.</p></div>
