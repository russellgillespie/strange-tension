strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, right.  To be true, I was...  recalled.  Had to leave you boys, didn't want to, but when you're compelled...  Nothing much you can do, eh?  As for the magics down here.  We're in some sort of prison complex.  It's pretty vast, but it has a lot of secrets, as I showed you there."  Points at the exit.  "Well, it seems that this prison was set up for spell casters and magic users of all types.  My guess, we're in an anti-magic shell.  Or maybe there's a mythallar somewhere around, but you best pray that's not the case!  We'll all get blown to smithereens if that thing goes wonky!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You say <i>recalled</i>...<i>compelled</i>...By what means? I'd rather not fall into any unavoidable traps on account of...whatever mechanism that is if you take my meaning."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He scratches his stubble.  "Let's just say...  the boss keeps a close grasp on what's dearest to me.  Sometimes I find it hard to say no, if you catch my drift.  He's a magic user, he can speak to me whenever he wants.  So, yeah, anyone with me would be at danger from him scrying or spying or whatever the Hells he does.  We can split this place and then part ways, if you're happier with that.  I just thought...  well.  I thought I at least owed you a conversation before I took off, if that makes sense.  No honor among thieves, as it were, but...  just seemed the right thing to do.  You and your mage friend are good people.  Owed you as much."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Understood. I suppose we'll cross that chasm when we come to it. Let's keep an ear for the guard and get ready to make our escape."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye." His look bores into Dieter, trying to gain some insight into his bearing.  After a few moments, he says, "One last thing.  Did you happen to find anything about a red crystal, 'bout yea big?"  He holds up his fist.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúCan‚Äôt recall seeing anything like that...Mind‚Äôs a bit hazy though, i suppose.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúNow?‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume gets up, waits at the barred window for a beat.  "Can't hear or see 'em, let's go."  He heads to the corner, pushes the moveable wall, and, little by little, an opening appears.  Torchlight flickers on a wooden ladder leaning against a wall.  Looking down the opening, it's only about an eight foot drop.  Frume offers for Dieter to go first.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Sure, what the hell."</p><p>He squeezes in and slides down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a rather tight fit, and when Dieter gets to the bottom, the tunnel that stretches before him is only five feet tall.  They'll both have to hunch while they're walking.   A lit torch is illuminating the hall as well as a intersection opening to the left and right 10-15 feet ahead.  (Roll20 is live!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The dilapidated Druid moves to and peeks around the corners.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another hallway.  Going left there's an opening to t he right, opposite on the right side.  The hall looks like it was carved hurriedly with shoddy tools; there are gashes and marks on the walls like blade cuts.  The floor is loose, dried clay.  Walking normally, Dieter and Frume slip on the scree and are probably going to be fighting with their footing all the way through.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They slyly slink...left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another long hallway ending in what looks like a mold-infested wall.  Two openings are on the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is also getting dim down the hallways, now.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of light farther in the tunnels.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to move back and take the torch from the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torch comes off easily, and you sense that it is magically lit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Sensing the magic in the torch, Dieter looks for any loose pebbles on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter spies a few pebbles which would work well with his plans. (üòÅ)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He...tries his stony cantrip.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A crackling comes from the druid's hands.  (Give me an arcana check, then a dex save.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The magic goes through, but not without consequences.  A sharp pain slices through Dieter's mind, sending him to his knees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúAaaaaghh! What the...?‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rubs his temples, each of which just felt a short sharp shock. ‚ÄúWell, these will come in handy at least. Might need to wait a bit longer before trying that again. And surely I shouldn‚Äôt go all firestarter anytime soon.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We need to get us some weaponry.  Who knows what's down here.  I've heard some strange stories."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúDo you know where they took our things?‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, back at the head of that hall.  We might be able to find a way up, but it might be better to beg off that stuff.  You have anything you can't part with in your pack?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚Äú...a great. many. things.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúBut let us not needlessly throw ourselves into the lions den. I‚Äôll search with you down here for some means to recover what was stolen.‚Äù</p></div>
