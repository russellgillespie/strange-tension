<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tugs at the elbow of Douglas' shirt and beckons he follow out the back and toward the Sleeping Sheep.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, his precaution ebbing away, blurts out...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What news of our friend Culver?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy's ears and eyes perk up at the sound of Culver's name.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Even with being tipsy, Dieter can spy a couple large looking men making their way over to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter turns his head, looking to meet Frenchy's gaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men cross paths with Maouelue and Douglas, on their way out.  (Perception check for Mao.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue steps past the two large men, but Douglas slows, recognizing that they're with the obese man.  He slows, grabbing the sleeve of Maouelue.  They watch the progress of the men toward Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first plate of food hits the bar in front of Dieter, and the barkeep says to the Frenchman, "You know, 5 silver won't cover his <i>whole</i> order," and leaves in a huff to the kitchen.  Bar patrons shout after him for service.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Douglas hasten out the back door and run around to the front entrance hoping to be at their companion's back before the burly men are able to make their way across the crowded bar room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men saunter up to where Dieter is sitting, remove the patrons next to him at the bar, to much verbal violence.  They sit, staring straight ahead, not paying much attention to their surroundings.  Occasionally they'll pass a glance between them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter jibes offhandedly in the brutes' general direction.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No response from either.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Mouelue enters the front of the tavern and bids Douglas keep out of sight near the door. He edges his way around the wall and sidles up to Frenchy, whispering to him to tell Dieter it's time go go.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tension mounts.  Patrons continue their drinking and merrymaking.  The music starts to come to a crescendo.  The two men continue to sit and stare into the ether. (Perception check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They don't seem to be taking notice of any one or anything around them, except for Dieter.  It's almost as if they're listening intently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter glances over at Frenchy, realizing he has not seen Maouelue and Douglas in awhile, and is surprised to see his companion and henchmen watching him apprehensively. He furrows his brow, questioningly...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue cast a searching glance around for the proprieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy attempts to signal silently that they need to leave...NOW.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A "Huzzah" goes up at the mention of another tune.  Douglas whispers to Maouelue, "The owner is the barkeep, Kennet.  Looks pissed, eh?"  The barkeep plops another plate down, this one greasy, fried fish bits and golden roasted potatoes.  The smell is heavenly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men take turns cracking their knuckles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter loses his patience.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelueâ€™s head drops.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one right next to Dieter leans back and looks toward the big man.  A glance passes between the two...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy take a few steps nearer to Dieter and makes himself known.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man next to Dieter taps his counterpart on the shoulder.  That man proceeds to take the stool he's on and <i>hurl</i> it across the room towards the people surrounding the musicians.  Simultaneously, the man next to Dieter tries to grapple him.  (Dexterity check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bar stool connects with more than a half dozen patrons, knocking them down, gouging and bludgeoning people left and right.  The place erupts.  Some people that were thrown out that were hanging around outside come barreling through the door, looking for a fight.  The barkeep and cook work quickly at closing the entrance to the kitchen, locking themselves in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Pandemonium reigns.  Dieter is grabbed, but slips through the clutch before there is purchase.</p></div>
