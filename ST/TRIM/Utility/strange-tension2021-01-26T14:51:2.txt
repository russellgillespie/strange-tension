<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue makes his way, heart oddly heavy and light at the same time, he meets Daran and the rest of the military group leaving the ready room.  "Hoy there, Maouelue.  We're headed off to the armory, see what we can check out there and what the deployments will need.  I could use a better bow, although this has been with me for many a year."  He smiles wistfully at the old wooden bow in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He nods stoically and joins the ranks, curious after all to see the royal armory.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several turns and twists later, the group comes within sight of a large golden door decorated with flourishes of weaponry.  Daran gets a goofy smile on his face as the doors glide open without a sound.  Inside, all manner of cabinetry and shelving holds golden weapons of war.  Brightly polished swords stand at attention, metal and wood bows cover a section of the wall.   All types of ammunition are in racks in the center of the room.  On a far was, more eccentric items are available.  Some eladrin are already here, outfitting themselves.  As the new group enters, an air of frivolity, and almost fraternity nature, comes out in the warrior.  All gear up for the coming battle.  (If you want, I can set up a list of what's available.  There are all basic weapons and ammunition as listed in the Player's Handbook.  For Fey-specific weaponry, we'll have to roll on a table.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a small table, there are a few items of interest Maouelue hasn't seen before.  A small wooden box labeled “Ekkio’s Bestiary”, a set of bracers with an etching depicting a centaur, a quartz crystal wound around with a single thread of starlight, and lastly, a gray velvet purse.  And up on the wall, in a place of honor, are two swords, crossed on an ornamental background.  One sword burns a red-orange-yellow shimmer, the other a blue-purple-white one.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen walks in, and all of the soldiers take a knee.  Including Daran.  She walks through to the section with the swords.  "These were forged long ago, back when my sister was simply the Winter Queen.  She was kind, sweet.  Not the cold-hearted person she is now.  These were never meant to fight against each other, they are best used together.  They can only be imparted to the champion of the Summer Queen.  Who shall rise to that title?  Present yourself before me, and I will see your destiny."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue kneels, "I am your champion, Queen Titania. It is my company's piercing of the veil that pushes these causes to the brink. In solemn service to the causes of justice I shall straddle the divide between worlds, between houses divided, between Summer and Winter, between Life and Death."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bids the wizard to approach and kneel at her feet.  (Does Maouelue comply?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He respectfully genuflects, down on one knee.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, shakes her arms out of her voluminous, sheer sleeves, and places her palms on Maouelue's temples.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A feeling like plunging in ice-water, naked, consumes the mage.  A feeling like all of his nerves have gone full tilt, and visions run through his head like stampeding animals running from a ravenous monster...</p><p><i>A tower, books, learning.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A field, walking through with Shi'Vandos, teaching.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A secret meeting, a secret brother, a secret family.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p><i>A series of tunnels, swarms of rats.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A return, triumphant, a meeting in the woods, an assassin, treachery.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The images spill on and on, until the moment they're in, then beyond, but the images get too fast to see, they blur together, they become as a pool of colored water, swirling, spinning...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As if pulled through an ice sheet, Maouelue opens his eyes and is back in the armory.  The Summer Queen rips her hands away and catches herself from falling on the table with the feywild oddities, knocking a few things on the floor.  Her face is contorted in a mixture of emotions.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
