<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She cackles as the giant's life force crackles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now dance for me just like your fallen friends."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She attempts to walk this one into the nearest tree as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He does, and hit it.  Hard.  But he has a really hard head.  Deformed, for sure.  But still hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sprints after the monstrosity.  Seeing it stop and then run directly at the tree, the half-elf gets an idea...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps on a branch and uses it to crawl up the thing's back.  It doesn't look particularly pretty, but it gets the job done.  Standing on the beast's back, Daran tries to sever it's spine.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It doesn't find spine, but it finds an artery.  Blood splays out in sheets, coating Daran and the tree in great gouts of blood and ichor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing reaches behind his back and grabs Daran.  Squeezing him, he throws him bodily across the field  The half-elf hits the base of a tree and crumples.  The giant roars with approval.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman elf screams and attacks the giant.  The leader is still having trouble getting up.  Suddenly, an old woman appears before him and gives him a vial of something to drink.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman's bow breaks with a <i>sproing</i>.  She throws it across the forest floor, rushes to pick up Daran's bow, and then rushes to the half-elf.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Startled at seeing his companion and guide flung so callously to the thicket, a surge of magic courses through Maouelue's fingertips.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ping. Ping. Ping. The purple bolts of light speed toward their mark, burying themselves in thick hide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>And yet the balls continue to get frostier.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Enough!," Cries the blood witch, ready to bring this fracas to an end.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'><i>?"</i></span></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A dark voice rings in Bellatrix's mind.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her confidence wavering at the arousal of <i>this voice</i> in <i>this place</i> Bella's breath shudders. She tries to regain calm and finish the job at hand with the last remnants of her constitution.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She withers....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Its as if the very fabric of this plane rejects the presence of the Blood Witch's uncouth magics here. Unseen hands slap at her every move as she struggles to conjure anything else to end this dread encounter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She tries a final blast, with the last of her energies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>From somewhere <i>deep</i> within, a cherished yet incredibly private memory, a source of power, rushes to her defense in this critical state. Life and Death seem to swing wildly out of balance as the magic flies!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As she begins to faint from the exhaustion of her soul power, she performs the faintest trace of her dance, falling to the ground as she implores the idiotic giant one last time to run its head into the nearest hardest object.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She falls to the ground, and as she does so, a darkness covers her.  It has never been seen in this land, and might never be seen again.  It covers her, clings to her <i>swallows</i> her, until she is cradled in a black pillow of negative energy in the middle of this beatific forest.  A growl emerges from the depths, the eladrin cover their ears.  The old woman leaning down to administer aid to the eladrin leader smiles widely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blackness contorts and morphs, bubbling up into a massive undead dragon.  It towers over the dazed giant.  It opens it's mouth and lets out a scream that shakes the foundation of the Feywild.  In one fell move, it dives upon the giant, eating it whole, and it continues to drive into the soil, the peaceful ground.  The darkness piles deeper, deeper, deeper into the ground, screaming the whole time.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, the tail of the monster flows into the forest floor, then...  silence.  And nothing mars the leaf-strewn ground.  Bellatrix lay at the center of the trauma, sleeping peacefully.</p></div>
