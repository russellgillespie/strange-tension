strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two magic users waken at first light, their eyes feeling somewhat heavier than usual. They each rise, stretch, and take care of their morning usuals. They each then take their newly crafted heirlooms outside into the morning light and dew for a spot of meditation and exercise. As they pose and twirl about in the sunbeams, the silver of their weapons twinkles and bends the light into waving spectra cascading over the ranch. Dieter imagines a cyclone from his past and spins around in sweeping arcs, while Maouelue plays at sending ice crystals around his orbs and watches the angled refractions dance. He casually lobs one over at the spinning Dieter, who spots it mid turn and strikes it with the eagle end of his bladestaff. The orb soars out into the field amongst the animals. The two catch each otherâ€™s eyes and smile. They needed this moment after the haranguing pressures of the previous days. The stop their exercises and climb over the corral fencing to go and retrieve the ball, taking note of the animals along the way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are few in the field, and only sparse farm hands out.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both spy smoke coming from near the house.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two men cut short their heats and quickly pivot to inspect the source of the smoke.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam and Heston have started a cookfire outside.  They've set out massive strips of white-grey meat, set to throw them on the fire as it builds.</p><p>"Mornin' friends!  How about some fresh snake meat to break your fast, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam chuckles and says, "Now, gimme second to sear the damned thing!  Unless you take yours rarified!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston chuckles too, concentrating on honing his knife but listening to the happenings of the farm in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The meat is cooked to perfection, and stories are told around the breakfast camp fire.  (Anything you want to ask Vam or Heston?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston sits back in his seat, taking a chew off his plug of tobacco, offers it around.  Vam declines, the takes a deep breath and pushes his plate away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, good sirs, I don't rightly know where to start.  Don't know if I'm going to enlighten you folks, either.  But I can tell you what happened after you slipped off to dreamland last night."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Bunch of us, we stayed up taking care of this here snake.  Bellatrix came through and told us Douglas was ready for burial, so we took care of that in the patch the town's reserved for such things.  Bellatrix ended up taking off after that, but she mentioned that we might want someone to watch over the graveyard that night, just in case.  I put one of my hands on it, he didn't see anything amiss all night.  Not a hide nor hair from Bazad.  Rhahlad did come back, but only for a few seconds.  Heston here scared him right off, just showed him what you gents faced down in the streets last night."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So...  I guess the best way to begin about Douglas and Culver is to say, I really don't <i>know</i> all that much.  Culver was a staple of the town, Douglas just seemed to be a passer-by.  They got to drinking together, guess that was their bond.  There was a miner friend of theirs, too, used to keep the end three stools at the Pig warm, if you know what I'm gettin' at.  Didn't interact with Douglas, but Culver and I go way back.  Get most all of my supplies from him.  Shame to hear he's gone missing."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There was some scuttlebutt about Culver and Douglas dealing with the big man from the Pig, calls hisself Molur.  People say they were looking for something for him, maybe laundering it through Culver's store.  But that's all hearsay, I've never had a bad deal from Culver.  He's a good 'un."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As far as them having a link to the Muhlen's, that's a no go.  S'far as I know," he sucks his teeth a bit, trying to wean out a bit of loose snake meat, "They don't have any connection at all.  There're all sorts and sizes of stories about the Muhlen's.  They're the royalty of Oakhurst.  Matter of fact, they used to have a mansion house not too far from here.  All decrepit now, not any place anyone could live in.  Their maw and paw used to live up there, along with gallons of children!  So many running all over the damned place!  The father, he had his life tied up into that mine, Krytos Hill.  When the belly went up on it, so did his fortune, and he moved right outta here, taking the whole family with him.  All except Veena and Hozieh.  They had already set up shop here and didn't want to head out."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Years passed, they became a staple of the town.  Some would even say the cornerstone.  We get so many just passing through, to have an established community started to make us think we could make something outta this place."  He takes a long, deep breath.</p></div>
