<div class="character-0"><p><i>Turns to the door and then search the iron key into the lock, twisting.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens smoothly, opening onto a domed hall.  Three doors exit from this room on the N, E, and S.  The S door is very elaborate, iron-wrought, with an odd keyhole in it's center.  There is a broken wooden door to the E.  To the N, an opaquely transparent barrier presents itself, the flicker of orange flames beckon beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head east to the mundane door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group enters the E door.  A short hall leads to a very warm room filled with a sour smell.  Manacles are screwed into the walls, several sets of them.  Blood of various hues color the floor.  As Frume nears one set of manacles...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bracelet section of one levitates and tries to clamp itself on him!  He deftly dodges, but everyone notices the manacles closest to the group start trying to latch themselves onto the heroes!  (Dex saves!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage dodges away as one comes near.  Just as Frume and the wizard move toward the exit at the N wall of the room, Dieter's arm and leg feel the manacles attach!</p><p>(Dex save again for Dieter!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid is able to avoid having another manacles clamp down, but the others are still holding him back.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter yanks back on the manacles, he pulls them taut, stretching their links across the room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls his sword from it's scabbard and slashes down hard across them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue slices through the arm chains, causing a spark of blue to emit from the chains.  It falls to the ground and does not attack again.  The druid's leg is still manacled, and another bracelet comes to clamp down Dieter's other leg!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The manacle slips just past the druid's leg!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And the last chain breaks.  The other chains are hovering, waiting for the two.  Frume is holding, waiting to throw the door open for the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter gets clear of the swarm of manacles, Maouelue gets snagged on one.  It attaches itself to the man's foot, but not tightly.  Enough to make the wizard hop back, realizing he's snagged on something.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another clean slice, and the three are away though the N doorway.  Frume shuts it behind the crew, saying, "That was fun, now, wasn't it?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The troupe is a hallway running N, ending in a T.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peeks around the corner.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the left, a darkened room is ominous. To the right, a gaping chasm is a mere fifteen feet away.  There is a small ledge that runs on it's edge, N and S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group turns back to the 4-way and inspect the phantasmal barrier.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They go to look at the paradoxical door to the north.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three approach the opaque glass-like substance of the orange-lit door.  There is no obvious sign of a knob or way to open it.  (How would the group like to attempt to open the door?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They don't yet attempt to open the door. They head back to the South end of the room and inspect the strange lock.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beautifully made door is solid iron.  Buffed to a fine polish, some of the filigree and hand-formed sections are minute, even for Maouelue's keen eye.  The scene depicts a two humanoids in a garden, surrounded by plentiful bounty.  Many animals set the scene as well, but eyes are drawn, either by some trick of the piece or magic, to a serpent in the center, twining it's way up the female's leg.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's eyes gleam a cold blue light from under his helm, sending a cross of radiance down upon the depiction.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects for a keyhole or mechanism.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a keyhole, off to the right of center.  It seems to be ingratiated into the scene, it is a star on the horizon.  (History or Religion check for more.)  Hinges are on the left side of the door, massive iron buckles.</p></div>
