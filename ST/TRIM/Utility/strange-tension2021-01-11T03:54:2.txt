strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gets shellacked by the greatclub and falls from the monster's back.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Hearing the sickening crunch from afar, Maouelue looks over and sees his receding companion, "DARAAAAN!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The female eladrin moves to stand over the fallen Daran, striking out with her sword!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The metal mage looks over at Bellatrix sweeping past him, the gazes back at the giant, whispering softly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The life and death matter at hand seems to pull at the opposite energies of the life cleric and the blood witch, something about being out here in the woods, in the feywild.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He shuffles over toward the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The flustered witch sees the vulnerable elf, metal clad and cowering, then stands tall against the advance of the giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She lays into the giant hoping beyond hope to save her...friend.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Again, her concentration swirls wildly out of control as her heartblood is destabilized.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her eyes look over at Maouelue in confused wonder and apprehension.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the blast floats past the giant, suddenly it disappears!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She desperately channels her dance again, hoping beyond hope...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's eyes go wide with wonder, then as he hears Bellatrix's call, he readies his mace, waiting for the sound of the giant crashing toward the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue cowers closer to the tree now, fearful for his life.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix moves a little further Northwest to try and draw the Giant's ire away from the cowering mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran rises, says something low to the elf in front of him.  Then, with another acrobatic move, rolls away to the north...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He stows his swords in one go, brings his bow up, and fires at the...  wait, it was just there.  He turns back and fires at the closest one.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The greatclub swaths through the air, catching an unaware Bellatrix in the shoulder.  She topples, falling prone.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The second eladrin gets pummeled with the club...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But she stays on her feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her two arm attack flails, just nicks the giant.  One of her arms looks broken.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Stay away from her!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The out-of-sorts and out-of-place elf find hims<i>elf</i> locked in melee combat with the giant. He valiantly chases after the invisible, yet lumbering, assailant.</p><p></p><p>"You will not harm her!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He swings wildly, but finds nothing, perhaps he was off by one footfall or more...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flabbergasted, he looks askance at the giant-crushed foliage around him, wondering what magics are at play here that would have him so unsure of foot.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix locks on to the sound of the greatclub's followthrough as she steadies herself from the blow. She pelts blast after blast of hot fire back at the wilting giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her final strike lands true in the nethers of the unwitting creature, laying it low.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the giant crashes to the ground, the Blood Witch sends her hex flying over to the feeble giant waning on the far reach of the battle, then sends another fiery ray chasing after it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The witch spits blood at the nearest fallen giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Effect Hex removed from FO3.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bolt after bolt of fire flies past the healthiest of the remaining giants.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She ends her turn in a swirling of emotion that she is not used to embodying anymore. Not since...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Enough of this."  Daran drops his bow and draws out his two scimitars dramatically.  Seeing the closest giant almost completely down, he strikes out at him with one sword, while spinning and attacking the bottom half of the other in combat with the eladrin leader.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lone giant, seeing his brethren falling around him...  (1-fights, 2-flees)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He drops his club and starts running the way he originally came, N.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The initial hit as it's leaving doesn't hit him.  The leader falls to his knee, panting.  "Finish him off!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran manages to get him as he runs by, but the eladrin's arrow flies wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maoulue, emboldened by the falling giants all around, dashes toward the final foe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pulls the mace up overhead with all his might.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mace slams into the giant's leg, making far less of an impression than Maoulue has made a scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Balls ice over once again....</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
