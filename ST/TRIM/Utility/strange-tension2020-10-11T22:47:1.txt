<div class="character-1"><p>The party makes haste through the forest and into Oakhurst.  Bellatrix says, "Although I know the way to certain people in the Five, I would be... unwelcome calling upon them.  Do you know who you would like to speak with first?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He scowls at Veena.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Did you take Veena with the group, or is she back at Trix's?)</p><p>"Yes, and no.  There is no head of the Five, they're all equally powerful, within the town as well as in the group.  There is Bazad Dunnol, the tanner.  Rhahlad Boste, he owns the coster.  Vam Stuniz is a wonderful horse trainer, he also works with a variety of farm animals, he's fairly popular with the citizenry.  Then there's Hozieh and Veena."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, I can take you there."  (If you'd rather not rp the blacksmith trip, we can just say you went there & picked up the bit.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group is anxious as they approach the ranch, looking around and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of all the animals.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter seems as calm as he has in a while in the midst of the beast party.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue looks as if he is bracing for a snowstorm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The quartet walk down the street,  the woman in the cage draws almost all of the attention.  Whispers flit back and forth between shop patrons and the rabble that roam through town.  There aren't a lot of people, but you feel that it probably doesn't matter, this is going to be the hot gossip today.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a quick stop by the blacksmith's shop to procure Dieter's staff attachment (which is a beautiful counterpoint to the sliver death accompanying the opposite side of the staff now), the group heads Southeast, to a substantial group of farmland.  Rows of crops sway in the autumnal breeze as farm hands work with various animals.  An interesting addition, A group of rothe' roam the pasture past the waving grain.   These buffalo-type creatures typically come from the north, and it takes a practiced hand to raise them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group plods deeper into the farm, you see a very dark-skinned man, wide brimmed hat in his hands, talking to a rothe', soothingly.  The man has curly white hair, balding a bit on the top.  Smile lines crease his face, and it's no surprise, he's grinning while talking to the large creature next to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He turns to notice the four people traveling towards him, smiles wider, and makes his way to you after patting the beast on it's rump.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I was wondering when I would have a chance to run into you folks," he says, winning smile possibly going even wider.  "Heard a lot about what you've done for the town already, and what you're planning on doing. Might fine, migh-ty fine.  This little place's been waiting for men like you, been saying it for years, isn't that right Bellatrix?  It's right nice to see you as well, ma'am."  And he gives a little bow.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Please, please, call me Vam.  No one calls me anything but, I won't let 'em!"  He laughs heartily.  "Now, what can I do for the Heroes of Oakhurst, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His smile falters, fades.  </p><p>"Wait, what did you say?"</p><p>He tries to see past you to the cage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seeing Veena, he's shocked.  He looks between the four of you, trying to understand what he's seeing.</p><p>"I don't understand.  She killed someone?  When did this happen?  How?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party informs Vam of the events in the forest, withholding that they carry her possessions for now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They also conveniently leave out the part about nearly setting the forest ablaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks sternly at the group.  "Well, I have to admit...  Not too sure what to make of all this.  I have quite a bit of history, professionally, with this woman, as most of the town does.  This sounds just like one of them fairy tales, I just can't believe Veena could be capable...  Have you told anyone else?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue fidgets idly with his triumvirate of sliver orbs while the converse.</i></p><p><i>Dieter idly thumbs the contours of his newly-crafted eagle totem.</i></p></div>
