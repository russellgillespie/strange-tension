strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard familiar is able to get a good quantity of yellow mushroom.  And, for good measure, was able to take a chunk out of the purple one, too.  Just as it flew in and out for the last time, a spore cloud caught it and he flew straight through.  (Con save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok, well...now I’ve got these mushrooms...  Now...Where the <i>hell</i> are we?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just past the mushroom cavern, the group sees carved stone walls with a hall moving off to the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“In for another shroom, in for another room I always say... Let’s head on!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They move to the hall....on the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the quartet moves through the mushroom minefield, they enter the carved room structure, looking as if it were either constructed by someone or something, or possibly transposed into this mountain somehow.  The hall, beautifully carved stone throughout, carries on for about 25 feet then opens into another small room.  Halfway down the hall is another offshoot to the right (leading W).</p><p>(Roll20 is updated, btw.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue preens.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Somewhere in a far off dungeon, Dieter broods...with his brood.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The cold, bedraggled crew carries on down the West offshoot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group makes it's way farther down the passages, farther seemingly <i>into</i> a complex of sorts.  The walls are contoured and sculpted, with patterns and pictures scattered throughout.  As the foursome enter into the passage, a rancid stench greets their nose.  Another long hallway opens in front of them, with a passage and broad stairs on their right (N), another broad passage to the left (S), and a crumbling wall revealing a purplish glow in front of them, 35 feet away (W).</p><p></p><p>Atop the stairs to the North, a small creature is floating above the stone floor...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Mree...  mree mree...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What curious oddity is this?" Maouelue exclaims. It appears fascinated by its own hands! Granted, If I had quite so many, I'd be fascinated as well." He casts a glance at Bella, concealing a wry smile.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Worried more about the expanding gas than the creature, the group doesn't get a great read on it's intentions.  However, it doesn't seem aggressive at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's steer clear of that one for the moment," the Metal Mage offers, "We'll scout around a bit first. Could this be the underbelly of the Fortress? That would be astonishing...yet somewhat intentional. Ah the whims of the Source are hard to fathom at time. I remember how Shi'Vandos used to go on at length about the mysterious weave of time and energy that constitute the Planes we inhabit. He would speak to me of deep, untraceable connections between different times and spaces. Ah, how I wonder what he might say could he be here right now." </p><p>The mage's musing turn to soliloquy as the power of this place mingles with his memories.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage comes to as if from a daydream of his ancestors. </p><p></p><p><i>Albrek...</i></p><p></p><p>He leads on West down the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue leads his companions past the curious flumph and into the Western corridor.  The hall would normally have ended in a solid stone wall, however there is now a decent sized hole in the Northern wall through which the party sees more purple and yellow mushrooms.  Their glow gives the room an eerie, almost ominous presence.  As Maouelue looks into the room, to the South a hard scraping and low growl can be heard.  And felt, as the bass resonance shakes the walls and floors, rattling their bones.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A word whispered in Sylvan sends Maouelue's familiar ahead to scout the birds eye view of the disturbance.</p></div>
