<div class="character-0"><p>“It would seem I am led here by more than one thread of fate, if everything I have heard these past months is to be believed.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And which threads would those be?"  He sips his tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a deep breath before speaking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I was told...I have a brother here. A brother whom I have never met.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin nods, encouragingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We seem also to follow, or be drawn along, in the wake of a mysterious Runemark. Giants and Dragons and Naga....oh my. It’s quite a tale in its own right...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It led us to the Summer Eladrin...the city of Starlight...” <i>The Mage’s voice drifts off into a minute reverie...</i> “And now here, under the frozen Fey tundras have we slipped and fallen on the slide of hubris, and though I feel nearer my destination than ever, the more I feel it sliding away.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nay, lad, you're not sliding away.  Although, the path ahead is extremely treacherous indeed.  As you've already seen."  He looks meaningfully at the trio.  "That being said, what little aid I can give you, I shall.  On one condition.  There is a spell that I have been trying to break for some time.  It seems the mage who locked myself and my cohorts down here liked to play with planar binding magics.  In the castle above, there is a crystal which should be the source of the binding.  Search this out and destroy it, and my aids will not be given in vain.  Is this acceptable?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods, reverently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We will break the stone. But pray, give us your name...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "My name...  is Aeneir."  (History check with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue recognizes the name immediately, but many of the stories he's been told are a bit hazy as they were told to him as a child.  Aefir had a younger brother, Aeneir, who was a great mage.  A seer.  It is said that through Aeneir's divination magic, Aefir was able to know about his destiny.  If this eladrin is serious, he would have to be way older than the Summer Court members, and, quite possibly, the oldest elf in all of the planes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Æneìr?....</i>”</p><p></p><p>“<i>Can it be?...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It can.  And is.  The damnable wizard we both seek conjured me up from the aether and bade me do his bidding.  I've been on death's doorstep for millennia.  It would be good to...  take the next step.  That is where you and your retinue come in."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What can you tell us about what we might find above?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A castle of ice and frost.  I'd wager you'd do well to find boots that grip the ground or you'll be sliding constantly.  It has been some time since I last traversed the palace... but both our wizard and the Pale Prince enjoy their...  creatures.  Abominations lie in wait, and more than likely a guard for the crystal.  Wits and cunning will go a long way, too.  Did you have any <i>special</i> requests in mind?"  He smirks and sips more tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Can you sense the presence of a half-elf that recently disappeared from here? He was of our party when...the demon...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir looks sadly down at the ground, then up to meet all of the eyes staring back at him.  "Sense... no.  But his destiny lives on past this day.  You may yet find him on the material plane.  Or maybe your ancestors will.  It's times like this I miss my eyeglasses.  I used to look over the top of them when I said things that profound."  He chuckles and pours more tea, offers to the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The group looks stricken for a few beats, then....</p><p></p><p>“Do you insinuate some other <i>special</i> that you would grant us in hopes of fulfilling this duty?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There are boons...  and there are boons.  It would depend on what you feel you need, but...  I'd like to be of some service to your party, yes."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Most gracious of you indeed. I do feel there is <i>something</i> missing as yet from our fold..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I fear our deficit may be a direct result of my, ahem, penchant for impetuousness. Perhaps summat that would allow me to either prevent or assuage harm that I might cause along the way. Something to protect those around me. I am a mage, but also a man of metal. The Platinum wants not but for zeal..."</p></div>
