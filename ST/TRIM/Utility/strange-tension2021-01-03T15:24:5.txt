strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok kids, time to go!” He beckons Shelli, with the blighted man on her back, over to the door and searches around for the scrabbling Flayco, “Here boy! Time to go find some meat!” </p><p>He marches determinedly toward the stone door. </p><p>“<i>Sungovall</i>...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door starts opening again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The motley crew shuffles, schlurps, and scampers through the door. Dieter eyes the scene cautiously and moves to the other magical door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads the menagerie to the curved wall, amazed at his dumb luck in the accidental linguistic limbo he’s be meandering through. He produces a flame to light the way, bracing for the impending psychic itch.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone door opens inward on the group, they all wait with bated breath to see the room beyond.  <i>Scraaaaape</i> The stone leaves a groove on the dusty floor.  By the light of Dieter's flame, he can view a circular room, unlit but with ready torches ensconced in the walls.  A few tattered tents are set up, but the main feature is a circular pit in the center of the room.  Dark clouds rage and roll in a pit, shadow lightning arcs and crackles without sound or light.  Above this miasma, as if floating atop it, looks to be a clay disc of sorts.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid moves around the room, careful not to get too close to the pit, he can see more of their surroundings.  There are several tables set up as workbenches.  Various items are strewn about, most of them used in some form of herbalism or construction aspects.  There is a large stone structure on the W side of the wall.  In front of it is a strange cylinder, set on its side, with four vertical sections with strange glyphs on them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sends his flame over to the nearest sconce and lights one of Jaecob’s torches from the resulting flame, moving around the room to light the rest. He snuffs out the torch he is holding and stows it back into Jaecob’s pack. He uses the resulting light to investigate all the markings in the room and to inspect the herbs for anything that might help his companion, as well as general healing and alchemical reagents.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lights ignite in their sconces one by one as Dieter traverses the room.  The last one is lit and the group can see the details of the work spaces.  Various herbs and accoutrement are scattered hither and yon, nothing looks fresh or even edible at this point.  Sticks can be seen sticking out of what presumably was a shrub or tree, all of it desiccated now.  There is a thrum in the air, and Dieter notices it gets more intense as he gets nearer the clay disc in the center of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes similar precautions to the last room casting his spell of detection.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are pings from the detect magic spell.  The cryptex in front of the stone structure gives off abjuration magic.  The disc is giving off the greatest magic signature he's ever experienced.  It threatens to overwhelm Dieter.  Abjuration plus another school he can't define are emanating from the disc.  The miasma is abjuration mixed with heavy evocation magics.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes time to inspect the glyphs on the cryptex with great care, hovering and tracing his fingers over the shapes about two inches away from the object.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are extremely odd looking.  (Roll an intelligence check.  Also, perception check too, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What Dieter sees is a bunch of dashes written in horizontal lines.  There doesnt seem to be a consistency or pattern to them at all.  Looking around the area, in the remnants of a collapsed tent, Dieter spies a rucksack.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Now what in the nine could this be?”, the Druid mutters as he shuffles over to the sack and takes a look inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>xmrfx hermano</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter opens the sack.  Inside he finds various gems worth 1,000 gp collectively.  He also finds a filigreed bowl with waves, aquatic life, and ocean scenes etched in silver.  Lastly, there is a black book that is bound with a leather thong, tied tightly in the front.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stows the items and inspects the book, just then wondering to himself whether Flayco ever did retrieve that clockwork ball...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A gold 'dragon', a coin from Waterdeep, is bound in the middle of the leather rope.  As its undone, the book falls open.  Draconic script mixes with common and the same horizontal lines on the cylinder.  (Intelligence check, please!)</p></div>
