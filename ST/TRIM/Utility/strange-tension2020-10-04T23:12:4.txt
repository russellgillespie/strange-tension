strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and says to Maouelue, "I'm sorry, goodsir, I don't study in the arcane much.  Mine is a...  different type of magic.  Some shy away from it, but it has been with me and my family for years upon years, generation upon generation.  A curse, some would tell you.  It has served me well, though.  And hopefully it serves you well, too."  She nods to the bottles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the bottles in hand and offers fair payment. Maouelue’s eyes gaze piercingly into Bellatrix’s. He has an inkling of what she might mean, but is eager not to let on to his fellows the precarious nature of their visit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He nods at the armful of potion bottles with which Dieter is wrangling.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her smile fades.  She looks at the silver ore and gives it back to Dieter.  "Although it is very much appreciated, kind sir.  I have no such use for silver or gold, though."  She shrugs and says, in a soft voice, "No place to use it."  She looks at Maouelue, studying him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, after an uncomfortable minute or so, she says, "Do you by chance have anything of Culver?  A piece of clothing of his?  Hair?  Something he owns?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas says, "Beggin' your pardon, miss...  um...  I... uh...  I have this... uh...  I have this trinket...  and, um...  and it... uh...  it belonged to Culver, ma'am."  He audibly gulps and holds out a small knife.  "Borrowed it some time back," he says to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two adventurers glance quickly at Douglas then at each other, then the witch, and back to Douglas again. Flabbergasted at this turn of fortune.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix smiles at the flustered man, nods as she takes the token.  To Dieter, she says, "We can discuss payment.  Let me see what fate lies in store for Culver.  Then we shall see what payment will be."  She takes the knife over to a darkened corner of the sitting room.  She pulls a dark cloth from what the group can see is an elaborately ornate mirror.  It gleams pristine in the firelight, not a mark or speck of dust is on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s eyes darken and he assumes a brooding posture.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix pinches the knife by the hilt, letting it dangle point downwards.  She holds it in front if the mirror.  She touches its opposite...</p><p>The reflection of the inside of the woman's house fades into dark clouds.  The clouds roil for a few moments, and when they clear, a scene emerges that is unnerving.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The view is several feet away, looking down on a bloodied Culver.  His hands are locked in manacles bolted to the wall above his head.  His clothes are tattered.  His head hangs to his chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party gasps each with their own peculiar terrors reflecting in their minds.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The surroundings are dark, dismal.  Some type of cell.  A metal clink is heard, and an unseen entity unlocks the manacles, letting Culver's hands fall to the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The view follows the Culver being dragged by his hands out of the cell, through a series of dank hallways, and finally thrown onto a wooden floor in front of a chair.  The chair is occupied by a tall man, his features are obscured.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A laughing voice asks Culver, "What did you think we would do, Big Dove?  Eh?  Just tell me where he is and we can finish all of this!  You can go home, clean up your shop!"  Laughing from around the room greet this statement.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell me where he is and who's working with him and you can walk out of here!  C'mon, man!  Let's get this <i>over</i> with!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter casts a furtive glance back at Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Culver moans.  He opens his eye, the other is swollen shut.  He pauses a moment.  Then spits blood at the  man in the chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room erupts in laughter.  Dark, deep, booming laughs, almost as if they were hoping for this action.  The man in the chair, the most jovial of all, steps closer to the man on the floor, kneels down, and now a full view of the man is available.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He has slicked back dark hair, thinning in front.  An almost handlebar, bushy moustache covers his pale face.   A few scars on his cheek and forehead mar his otherwise fairly handsome face.  Debonair, even.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks down at Culver with a smile that doesn't touch his eyes.  He grabs the man on the floor by his throat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, a man in dark robes runs over to the mustachioed man and whispers in his ear.  His eyes go wide and he yells at the robed man, "WHERE?!  Find it!  End it NOW!"</p></div>
