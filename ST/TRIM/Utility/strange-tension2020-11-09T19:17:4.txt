strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Mao is left scratching his head, but Dieter gets a ping, back in the recesses of his mind.  He remembers an old tale of a garden, hidden away from the world.  It was said that this garden was where the original elves came into Faerun, but they were deceived by the beings that were already present in the world.  There was something about a star leading them, and a star being the key to their salvation... but he just can't put his finger on the exact phrasing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls out the snake amulet he has been carrying and inspects it more closely.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter keeps digging back, back, and remembers something else.  There were Naga present at that first meeting.  He remembers there was a massive battle, with the elves striving for a foothold on their new land, and the serpents trying to drive them back whence they came.  Maouelue remembers being a young boy and being told about these stories, how his people came from a land across the seas, out of time itself.  It is said that the stars hold the key to returning to that place.  But the way to travel the stars is long forgotten, lost to the ages and usurped by magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is nothing about the amulet that is special or that stands out.  The serpent attached is a standard symbol of the ouroboros, the central icon of the Naga.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks down at the bone key he carries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He thinks of all the bodies to which they've lain waste. He thinks of these accursed tunnels. And poor Culver! He must have met some terrible fate by now. It is all one mystery after another...Oh the torment!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bone gives Dieter no further insight into the mystery.  There is something, though...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something odd about the construction.  And the material...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter holds it up to the group for a closer look.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Daaaah Frooom...caaan yu halp mie wiph thaaiiiis..?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks at Dieter with serious concern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I mean to say, what do you make of the construction of this key?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he tries to hand it to Frume, he drops it to the cavern floor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, well, ya know...  Seemed like the thing to do."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bone key cracks down its length, but it is still in one piece.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then tells the group to wait here while he check on something. He goes invisible then dashes away before a word can be uttered.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter heads back to where their Muhlen sisters had first spotted them and tries to secure a length of rope to assist in managing the climb.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has a harder time getting to the place where the beast was.  The minions didnt have anything on them, but the boss might.  As he approaches the entrance, he sees it littered with rubble.  The entrance has collapsed.  (You might need the others help.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gives a big groan as he makes his way back over to the rope.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Haaaay you guyyyyyyyss!!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Come help me over here! Back down the hole!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He waits a few moments for a reply.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You hear Frume making his way to you after a time.  "Whassa matter, Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I think we were hasty in one of the previous chambers. I need to ask your assistance. Come down.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"On it."  He heads to where you are.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When he sees it he sighs heavily.  Then, taking your meaning, he looks down his arm...</p><p>"Ah,  I don't know how much help I'm gonna be here, lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue has tagged along and offers to help.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The three haul rocks for a good few hours, finally revealing the wreck of the hallway and room the snake-man-warrior was killed in.  Most everything in here is covered in a think layer of soot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pokes amongst the remains, looking over the warrior's corpse for anything that might have survived the blaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue heads over to the alcove he didn't properly appreciate before. Was there something there?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sees ashes and soot.  Every coffin, every clay statue, the bones of the monster they faced-off with...  ashes and soot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue finds another idol, this one bronze.  Same design as the gold one.  There is a crack in the base of this statue, and it's drawer hangs lopsided inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue attempts to use his sword to wedge the drawer open.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a <i>pop</i> it tumbles out of the base, completely off it's track.  Inside is an object wrapped in a piece of parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard gently unwraps the parchment trying not to touch the object yet.</i></p></div>
