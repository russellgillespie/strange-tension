strange-tensionHe looks at it, wincing.  "No.  I... ah...  I don't that'll do, lad.  Might be needing to find another home for me other sword, p'haps."  How holds his stump up to the torchlight to examine it.
"Aye.  I'll take what I can get.  I in the meantime... you lead the way, gentlemen."   He tries at a smile.
*As the two sort out the equipment, Maouelue walks in down the hall.*
With a sorrowful look, he awkwardly reaches into his right scabbard with his right hand and pulls out...

*Dieter looks Frumious dead in the eyes and says,* “I will hold this for you until you can hold it again. We will not give up on your recovery. We must go now. “
Frume nods.
As the party makes its way through goblin warrens, you peek into the room you missed on the right the first time you passed by.  Dieter sticks his head in.  This room tapers to the back wall and the corners.  It is littered with dung, egg shells, and noxious fumes.  The floor is a viscous mud/dung mix.  He doesn't see anything or anyone in the room.
The party passes through the remains of the fireworks room and into the cavern of the goblin wallower.  The thing takes up a good portion of the room, however it doesn't look to be interested in any of the members of your team.

*They leave the goblin to his moping and carry on to the SE passage.*


Mao hurls into the stew of filth.  The goblin lets out a deep, burbling laugh.
*Maouleue spits and wipes his mouth, swishing a drag of water from his skin then spitting again.*
*They pick up the pace, a bit of frenzy taking over the group.*

The group moves down the narrow hall.  Five feet in...
Maouelue sees an arrow fly though the air at him and lodge itself in the clay wall to his right.  Grunts and words in the goblin tongue can be heard from around the corner.
*The Druid touches his ring and fades...*
*Maouelue’s hand glows blue...*



Neither Maouelue nor Dieter can see the goblins at this time.  Looks like they're waiting around the corner.
Dieter sneaks up at the corner and sees three goblins waiting for the group to breech the area.
All three have their shortbows up and ready.
*Dieter tries to use his invisibility to sneak behind them.*
*Maouelue stays back a moment.*


The goblin is sliced in twain and doesn't even realize it.  The top half slides off slowly, and while the arrow is still nocked, the goblin splits and the two halves fall away.

GO1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (16) + 2 = `18`.
GO2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (4) + 2 = `6`.




"Shite, I can't use my FUCKING crossbow!"


The goblin looks around for an exit.

“Don’t run.“
*The Druid goes invisible again and the patter of his feet lead down the hall.*
*The metal mage manages his movement in a measured manner making motions merely mimicking more mobile mates.*
[75 xp]
*Maouelue never hesitates to enter the aenima...*


*They each quaff as they go.*
The group clears the area.  Noticing a hallway ending in a large oak door, Maouelue leads the team toward it.  (Perception check from Mao, please!)


The door is locked but not trapped.
*They leave the door for now and head back around the hallway.*
The tunnel twists around and ends in a wall.  There is an iron ring jutting out from the middle of the wall.
*The wizard gives it a cursory tug as Dieter backs up a pace.*
The door opens, with some effort.  Scraping of stone-on-stone echoes in the pillar room.  The stone people and basilisks are still holding their positions.
*The group scours the area looking for a key.*



The adventurers look around, no one can find anything that looks like a key.  There are some goblin prints that were not there previous, though.
*They whisper to each other and making a plan to split up and move around the circle. The invisible druid will go through the statue chamber and back around. The wizard and the injured man will go past fungal goblin King.*



Dieter finds something that could be a key?  Frume is no help at all.  Maouelue, as he's moving through the muck near the golblin king, steps on something odd.  He feels it with the toe of his boot.  It has the shape of what he's looking for...

The mage sifts through the slop and comes up with a tarnished iron key.
*He heads around to the door and tells us to go find the druid.*
Dieter finds the other two and holds out a bone that has been chiseled and whittled to look like a key.
*The wizards stares bewildered at the druid, chuckling about the bone key in his hand.*
*Turns to the door and then search the iron key into the lock, twisting.*
The door opens smoothly, opening onto a domed hall.  Three doors exit from this room on the N, E, and S.  The S door is very elaborate, iron-wrought, with an odd keyhole in it's center.  There is a broken wooden door to the E.  To the N, an opaquely transparent barrier presents itself, the flicker of orange flames beckon beyond.
*They head east to the mundane door.*
The group enters the E door.  A short hall leads to a very warm room filled with a sour smell.  Manacles are screwed into the walls, several sets of them.  Blood of various hues color the floor.  As Frume nears one set of manacles...
