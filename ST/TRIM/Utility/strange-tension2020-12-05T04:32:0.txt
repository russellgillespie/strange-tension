strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens with a squeak and squeal.  The musty room is filled with sacks, crates, and a few small barrels.  One is leaking in the back of the room, a puddle pooling beneath it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They two give the provisions(?) a once-over.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Most of the bags are beans or grains, their freshness is in question.  Plus, all of the foodstuffs in here have been around the ill-smelling table maybe too long.  Dieter finds some jerky that might be okay.  Just as he turns to give some to Frume, he hears a skittering from the ceiling...</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>SW1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (9) + 1 = <code>10</code>.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah shite, with these things!!"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As they drop from the ceiling, Frume tries swatting them from his face while Dieter slices with the sickle.  The group come up from everywhere, skittering on the walls and all over the two men.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spiders start biting Frume, making him yell in frustration and pain.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>You do not have permission to view this combatant's attacks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are relentlessly biting at the two heroes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume wipes the last few spiders away from himself and Dieter, and with a deft swipe of his dagger and stamp of his boot, the swarm is no more.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What's the chance that's the worst living thing we see down here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[100 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Heh...I’ll not answer that rhetorical for fear of jinxing it.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks the far wall of the corridor for any more shenanigans.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't tell if there are any more shenanigans or not.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gives it up and head back south to the other hallway.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now just what do we have here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter moves from the pantry and through the rooms to one of the main halls, Frume follows, giving a longing look at the gem-door.  Dieter moves to the end of the hall.  There the hall turns left, ending ten feet away with a door on the N end.  Several holes are cut into the clay wall.  Inset in the holes are several skulls, lit candles in the center.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Before the left turn, the N wall is covered with green mold, almost like algae.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume comes over to help. He places a dagger at where he believes the hinges to be, working the corner while Dieter tries again.  (Another, with advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Thanks Frume.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger slips, the door creaks a bit.  But it remains shut.  "For the love of all that's holy, why are the doors down here impossible to get through?  It's almost like they don't want anything moving around down here, eh?"  He gives Dieter a dark look.</p><p>"Fuck it, lets try this."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door hits a low note, <i>bong</i>, but does not yield.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Worth a shot, I guess.  Looks like there's a door at the end of the hall."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm... Maybe we’ll find a means of opening it elsewhere.”</p><p>Dieter inspects the door for a locking mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is feeling exceptionally mediocre today.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two look over the door.  Is doesn't have a keyhole, however there is a gem inset in the center.  This one is a dull brown.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How’s that loot lust of your doing there eh Frume? Wanna give this one a go together?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, always a lustful man, Dieter, don't ever think otherwise!  We breaking down the door or trying to remove the gem?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The gem friend. The gem.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gem <i>pop</i> comes out in Dieter's hand.  The door <i>creaks</i> open.  The light shines on an unadorned room.  Rough clay all over, but there are a few piles of dust or ash on the ground.  In the middle of the room stands a stone column.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gem is imbued heavily with conjuration magic.  When inset into a wooden object like a door or a chest, it acts as a magical lock of sorts.  When the person trying to unlock fails their check, the wooden object grows a mouth with sharp teeth and attacks said person.  To set it into a wooden object takes an arcana check DC 13, with subsequent tries going up by DC 1.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I suppose we should inspect this here pedestal, eh?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter beckons Frume over to the stone structure. He kneels down and looks around it’s base and searches for any markings that might betray its secrets.</p></div>
