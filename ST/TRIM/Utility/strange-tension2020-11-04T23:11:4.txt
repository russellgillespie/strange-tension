<div class="character-1"><p>She screams in rage and frustration.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think it's time to end this, boyos!  Mind yer heads!"  The woman looks strangely at the new man rushing at her.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter checks things over with Frumious.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is no trace of the other Muhlen sister.  As Maouelue inspects the corpse, he sees the skin is bubbling and sizzling.  Acid is eating away the flesh, an acrid smoke is rising from the remains.  (Con save and investigation check if you're going to inspect the body more closely).</p><p></p><p>The potions are numerous and multi-colored.  You do see red potions you know to be potions of healing.  There are also dark, foreboding vials.  A green, effervescent tincture. </p><p> A purple/yellow mixture that is constantly swirling.  All in all, a variety of ghastly stuff.  The other thing you notice is the lack of ingredients for potion making.  There are herbs hanging and a few items in the middle of being chopped and prepared.  But for the quantity of empty bottles, there aren't many ingredients for new brews.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There are a few gems, not very good quality, all totaling 10 gp.  There is also a spell scroll of chromatic orb (first level).  The rest of her robes and satchel are burning in the acidic ooze.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter notices it's not the only one, there are couple more just like this green one already in the bandolier.  (He would also know that the damage on this one is 7d6, Con save of 13 with half damage on a save.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The liquid is viscous, syrupy.  (It would coat four arrows or bolts, or one shortsword - or similar - for 1d6 rounds.)</p></div>
