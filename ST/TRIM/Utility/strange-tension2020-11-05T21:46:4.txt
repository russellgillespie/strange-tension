<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take note of this and head back to the the other hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You enter the massive room, torchlight doesn't even reach to the other end nor does it illuminate the ceiling.  Maouelue can see the dimensions of the room, but the bright light is limited.  (Perception or Investigation on anything, let me know!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any sconces or braziers</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are several, all throughout the chamber.  Some still have torches in them, but they look like they've gone to seed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter produces a flame and tries to light as many of them as he can</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a look around.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are statues of humanoids, goblins, orcs, a variety of beings littered around the room.  No rhyme or reason, it seems.  The pillars have sculpted snakes running  the length of their 30ft height.  These are very finely crafted.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has a hard time, but Maouelue is totally into it!  (Persuasion to bring Frume along, he's kinda on the fence about it.  The faces look too real...)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hoy, lads...  I don't know about knocking these statues over.  Look at the eyes on this one?!  No way an artist can do this, am I right?!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and the mage start setting fire to the clay statues.  It takes a bit to start them up, and Frume is not really taking part in it.  He's going around the room examining the statues and pillars.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Once the blaze begins to feed on itself slowly, the two begin to inspect the rest of the room with Frume.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A growl comes from the E end of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party draws blades. Dieter dabbles one of the standard poison vials on the silvers of his staff.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A second growl couples with the other as two animals lumber in through the E entrance.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Hm.  Ok sweet</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume moves along the side of the wall and gets a sharp pain in the back of his head.  It happened as he looked at the animal in the eyes.   This might be more difficult that he originally thought...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>While one tries to bite Maouelue and misses, the other charges Dieter, turning it's gaze on the druid.  A hardness starts coming over his body.  (In 1d4 rounds he will be turned to stone - at the moment he is just restrained.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh gods, are you okay Dieter?!"  He tries to sling another bolt at the creature.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The basilisk rears and roars.  The roar turns to a shriek of pain.  The creature has stopped moving on the opposite side of the shield.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hears his friend’s plea and tries to turn, with legs that keep getting heavier, to his backpack. He pulls out the mirror...he said he wouldn’t look. But he needn’t. Just one of them.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The roars of the two basilisks slowly turning to stone is shrill, piercing.  Their pain doesn't last long as they turn quite quickly.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There are a couple things that can help.  A potion made of the mandrake root can cure, but it takes a bit to brew and work.  The spell Greater Restoration would work for sure, Lesser Restoration may.</p></div>
