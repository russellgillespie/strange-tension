strange-tension*Dieter's eyes are covered in what looks like cumulus clouds reflecting off of the ocean for a moment, when the swirling orange light from his blade whisks it away. He looks around for any ways these two holes might be connected before choosing whether to try and climb out of the hole.*


Dieter leads the way, searching for passages that connect.  After a couple rounds, there doesn't seem to be a direct connection yet.
*They make their way back over to the hole they came from and call to Vam for a hand up.*
Vam is peering down the hole, nods, and throws a rope ladder down.
*The group climbs up and asks Vam if he knows where the snake is.*


Dieter starts up the rope ladder.  About halfway up, he hears hissing coming from the tunnel...
*He shines his sword light back down, preparing to drop and perform a downward thrusting attack if he sees what he thinks he will.*
*Dieter holds on to the ladder lying in wait for the snake's reappearance.*


The constrictor dashes toward the waiting druid, his flaming sword lighting the darkness.  It snaps at the dangling human, but misses.  On his way past, the sword flashes and nicks the snake in the side.  Another roar, and the snake tries to scramble back.
*Maouelue tries to slow the giant serpent's retreat, his hands glowing white then sending out a frosty beam at the slithering form.*

*Maouelue forgets to hold on to the rope while channeling his ray and falls down after the snake.*
*Dieter's animal rage is beginning to wane. He summons the fleeting vapors of his strength and hurls himself at his retreating prey, flaming scimitar held high, ready to plunge in the snake's spine.*

The snake takes yet another massive hit from Dieter's sword.  It falters, not quite knowing what to do.  It sees the wizard off balance and the druid hanging on to the ladder, trying to make his way up...
And he attacks!

He attacks with his bite, sinking his fangs *deep* into his opponent's leg.  He stays there, swaying as Dieter hangs on to the rope ladder.
*Maouleue breathes deep, blowing frosty breath onto one of his triumvirate. He loads it into his sling and lets fly at the snake's left eye.*

*Dieter drags himself over, standing above the snake with a limp bloodied gaze. He pulls his arm back and thrusts the flaming point right into the serpent's side.*

*...but he slips at the last moment in his exhaustion.*

The snake laughs, with a hissing overtone.
*He reaches out to the trio of Maoulue's silver orbs while on the ground and imbues them with his last spiritual energies, then slumping down on one knee.*
The snake again looks between the two...
And tries to make a dash down the tunnel. (Dieter can take an attack of opportunity. !i aoo <combatant name> <attack name> -t <target name> [arguments])

The snake flies past Dieter and down the tunnel.
*Maouelue runs after the snake and hurls a magically enchanted stone at the fleeing snake.*

*Dieter is...shall we say, pissed. He just wants to kill this damned snake so he can go have a pint and pass out at the nearest place that will have him. He lunges, one more time, at the snake. May this be its fiery end.*

*Dieter imagines himself doing that...but realizes, he's too far...He must be hallucinating now...*


*Instead, he picks up one of the beautiful orbs, gestures to Maouelue and rhetorically asks, "May I?" then loads it into his own sling, running toward the snake and hurtling the shining magic ball at the snake.*

The stone flies down the darkened tunnel.  You hear a *thud* as it connects with something.  Then you hear a muffled sound like a large body hitting the ground.

*Dieter slumps to the ground in pure exhaustion.*


Vam hustles down the rope ladder and offers assistance.
*Maouelue beckons him to tend to Dieter, then moves over to examine the snake more closely, looking at its fangs and markings.*
*Dieter takes Vam's hand and gestures toward the rope, then begins to stand up and head that way.*
*As he begins up the ladder, he thinks of the snake and sees something gleaming in his bag. The mirror...Frenchy...He'd have to keep that in mind going forward. This was another near-fatal encounter.*
Vam helps the druid up the ladder, saying, "Here ya go now, take your time.  There's a nice bed waiting up there for you, just a bit further now...)

Maouelue checks over the body of the snake.  It's pretty hideous.  He's a constrictor snake, about 12 feet long.  Good meat for the taking, the hide is very valuable if tanned and treated correctly.  It wasn't poisonous, and even though it could speak and had smallish appendages that could have been called arms, it did not use weapons.
*Maouelue picks up his orbs and wipes them off on his robe. He tries to being hauling the snake back toward the opening and calls to Vam for assistance.*
Vam is still helping Dieter up, but Heston is down there in an instant and gives you a hand.
*They hook the lower ropes of the ladder around the serpent's arms, then climb up and try to hoist the carcass.*

The two of you haul the beastie up, bring it to the barn, and truss it up.  Heston then says, "I'll start on the skinning and such.  Why don't you go ahead and get yerself some sleep, there."
