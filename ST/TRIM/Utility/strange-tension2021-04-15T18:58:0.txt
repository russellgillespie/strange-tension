<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“This mage still has a few tricks up his bracers!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Mewlew was added to combat with initiative 12.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Disintegration...<i>that’s</i> the one!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The seconds tick by slowly, tensely.  All are getting ready to attack when or if they see the beast, while at the same time keeping an eye out for the disappearing ranger.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue thinks back to the last few...  have there been days here?  When they first transported here, Daran had an item he held onto.   He kept it in his bag.  Maouelue's pretty sure he saw Daran reaching into his bag before he disappeared.  Also, Maouelue's pretty sure there was no way to come back from that injury.  Daran, wherever he might be, is either dying or dead.  (He was at 0 hp.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No response.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue directs the panther to sniff out the dying Half elf.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The panther doesn't sense Daran at all.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A cold fury runs through Maouleue. </p><p>“It is time. Get ready.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The panther assumes a position so as to run down the hall and pounce on the beast as it reappears. Maouleue cycles his concentration for maximum damage. Bella and Benna ready their respective beams.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A bead of sweat runs down Bellatrix's brow.  Benna's eerily quiet.  That strange bass shaking rumbles softly through the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The air crackles with tension.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A strange tension.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[3000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Where the beast should have appeared...  nothing materializes.  Benna chuckles, once.  Bellatrix closes her eyes and lowers her hands.  A soft sob escapes her.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, a <i>pop</i> makes the quartet jump, even scaring the panther.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In the middle of the room is the end of the monster's tail bone, dripping with venom.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Telepathically, to all</i> "This is my end of the bargain."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Benna! You beauty!” A few metal-clad moments later and Benna is set back down to earth by the magnanimous mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Apprehensive glances are cast all around. </p><p>“<i>Right!</i> Let us make haste!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You? You tell <i>us!</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes her in his albeit cold hard arms.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna will comfort her as well, rubbing her back.  </p><p>"There's no body.  That could actually be a good thing."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We may yet see Daran again...someday.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue harries the group south down the corridor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh blast it all to hells!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The handle turns but the door doesn't open.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue appears to take out his frustration at the disappearance of Daran on the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door cracks down the middle.  One more good knock'll do it all in. Maouelue sees something shiny through the crack.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace hits in the same place, showering the group in splinters.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’m....tired...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wood withers away under Benna's fingers, showing the group the inside of the room...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone walls sap the brilliance of the treasure trove on the floor.  A chest or two are in the room, as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Good lord...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One chest is overloaded with gems, smaller stones but worth about 10 gp each.  This chest is small, but contains 40 gems all told.  There are coins scattered throughout the room as well, totaling 800 gp.  (Another d100, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a solid golden table are two potions.  Inside one is what looks like smoke, writhing and twisting around.  The other hold an effervescent liquid, the bubbles rising to the top continually.  (Arcana check for these.  If you'd like to try a drop of the potion, you have advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A solid gold disc is affixed to the far wall, catching everyone's eye.  It looks like a coin, with the profile of a humanoid on it.  (History check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The panther raises his right paw in respect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first is a potion of gaseous form, enough for two people.  The other is a superior potion of healing.</p><p>The 'coin' on the wall depicts a fire giant, head wreathed in flames like Roman laurels.  The trio knows very well that giants are world renown for their rune mastery, some of which can be seen on the rim of the golden circle.  (Anyone speak Giant?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The panther is now standing on hindquarters, raising both fists in tacet approval.</i></p></div>
