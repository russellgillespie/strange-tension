<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>I'm here for a tension</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(🙂)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Format will be.

Regular text is descriptor text.
italics  will be for thoughts (or just say it's a thought in regular text.
(OOC:     ) will be out of character
"   " will be what your character is saying.

I always find it better reading if you put talking lines on separate lines.

"Like this"

Then moving on to the next line of descriptive text.

<p>@Russell </p><p>lately trying to keep an ear out for any sign</p><p>of adventure and you hear a lot about what</p><p>is going on in the town. It’s no surprise that</p><p>you have begun to recognise lots of the</p><p>patrons and stall owners. Many are just</p><p>weekly customers and some regular</p><p>travellers from a nearby village but you also</p><p>have your chaperoned nobles from the</p><p>merchant sector and adventurers looking</p><p>for supplies. Much like you they standout,</p><p>something about their bearing making</p><p>them noteworthy. You’ve also come to</p><p>know some of traders by first name and</p><p>when one day you’re standing looking at</p><p>the spices on the colourful exotics stall you</p><p>spot the merchant Culver quietly talking to</p><p>a miner, concerned looks on their faces.</p><p>You sidle up to within ear shot and pretend</p><p>to examine the ceramic kettles on the</p><p>barter stall.</p><p>“Have you seen Douglas recently?”</p><p>“I saw him at the Pig and Falcon a fortnight</p><p>passed but not recently, why do you ask?”</p><p>“He was meant to be working up at the</p><p>Mine at Krytos Hills, you know beyond the</p><p>red plain, but I haven’t seen him of late.</p><p>Usually he’s at the Pig as you say.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t think there’s anything to worry</p><p>about. He’s probably just camped out</p><p>somewhere.”</p><p>“Nobody has seen him.”</p><p>“Not even down the Pig?”</p><p>“No, it’s been a while and I’ve known him</p><p>for an age. For Douglas to spend this much</p><p>time away from the tavern seems very</p><p>strange.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“The problem is Culver, that I’ve heard</p><p>there are goblins roaming those parts</p><p>recently. I just hope the old fool hasn’t got</p><p>himself into trouble.”<i>himself into trouble.”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "'scuse me gents...I couldn't help overhearing that your friend might be in a spot of bother. Is there anything a couple of adventurers like myself and my wizard friend here aught do to help?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Miner: "Wizard friend, you say?!  Well, I suppose you could help, might take a wizard at that.  You familiar with Krytos Hill?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I've heard tell of the place, yes, but a Wizard is always open to others' ears."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Culver: "Aye, you might have heard, then, there is silver in those hills.  Huge veins of it, enough to make ten men richer than the richest man in Waterdeep.  Our friend Douglas was on the team mining it.  He always comes back to town bragging about how much he's bringing in.  Either someone has caught him up on the lies, or something's happened in that mine, because he hasn't been back for some time now."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "It would appear that your friend might be in peril even as we speak. Maouelue, I fear we must hasten away before the hour is past."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Indeed, I would not let an innocent man face a needless fate. Let's away at once."

*The miner reaches into his bag and says:*
"Hey, take this.  It might help."
*Miner gives you an overland map with the way to the mine marked clearly.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “When one knows the way, one knows there are other paths as well. We will take this in good faith our path is the righteous one.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *this guy...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You heading out then, or is there anything else you'd like to do before you go?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Yes...let's away on our *righteous* path...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue unfolds the map and shows it to Dieter. They both look at each other and nod to head directly toward the mine on foot.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're still about 40 feet away from the entrance, just fyi.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let us approach with caution. There appears to be someone home.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue approaches the cave entrance from the right, Dieter from the left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter calls out magnanimously: "Hello in there. Is anybody home?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *I see what "Caution" means to a Druid...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is no response.  You hear the calls echo throughout and rebound and come back to you very quickly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let us enter and inspect this encampment more closely.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I'll take the lead.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Any form of light?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue lights a torch.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
As you peek into the cavern entrance you see:
*This open space feels like a crucible, cut
into the hill side. The rock has been chipped
away and a floor created. The first thing
that strikes you are the two bedrolls
situated next to a circle of stones that
surround a fire. A chest sits in the shadow
of the rock face, next to one of the bedrolls.
Chips of stone lay around and a box
apparently full of rocks sits to one side.
There are five tunnels leading into darkness
spaced around the wall and appear to have
once been the focus for the workers.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Well, I never could say no to a peek inside a chest in these situations... Let's have a peep-see.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Your kleptomancy will be the death of us one day.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *shrugs and attempts to open the chest anyway*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How are you checking the chest?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Manual inspection)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You go to inspect the chest and see that the lock has already been broken off, in a brutal fashion. </p><p>(Do you want to check for traps?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Please...Don't go blindly to your fate my friend. Let me check that for any malfeasance.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *checking for traps. check check checkity check*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(Investigation check, please :))

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(NAT 1...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue opens the chest.  It creaks and a very noxious odor comes out.  Take 1 point of damage from the nausea that comes over you.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
Maouelue: 7/8 (-1)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(Had to look it up :P)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard looks in, he sees random body parts, rotting and creating an ooze a the bottom of the chest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice!  Have you used Discord before at all?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Poor souls..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yup! Quite a bit actually. Haven't done too much modding though)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Awesome!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Well...that...that is not what I was hoping to find. Let us not end up that way ourselves, old friend...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Indeed.”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter notices two things.  The bedrolls have a layer of dust on them, indicating they've been there for a while, maybe a tenday.  Second, the sound echoes strangely deeper in, giving it a weird, unbalanced vibe.  It could be the way the stone was mined or the way the tunnels go, but the acoustics are giving everything a strange, undulating texture to speech and sounds.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “These walls seem to vibrate with a strange energy. In your scholarship have you ever read of anything similar?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let me recollect...”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(History check?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hit it up!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue taps into his Eleven history, recalling a bit about silver having a strange property when it comes to sound.  Silver mines are known to play with miner's inner ear, make them unbalanced and groggy.  It's not unheard of for miners in silver mines to wear items over their ears to protect them from the sound.   However, it does leave them open to attack, if they don't have the proper security on hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let not the sound of the waves in the chamber affect your eyes young druid. The spells weaved by the silver in these places can intoxicate even as they prey.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Understood. Years of practice ignoring your more asinine statements will have prepared me will for this. Heh, amirite?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Honestly...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *zing*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let's keep track of our path as we delve deeper. Keep to the left.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The company moves into the hallway left of the cave entrance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I was just checking on that.  We'll say you both sit for a while, getting your bearings and Maouelue casts his spell out to find a bat.  Animal handling check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think the spells just summons a spirit bat)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>About a half hour into Maouelue's meditation, a group of bats flies by outside in the darkening dusk.  One of them breaks from the pack to glide into the edge of the cavern mouth.  It lands, upside down, right above the wizard.  It's eyes are open, however, and it's eyeing Dieter hungrily.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter side-eyes the bat</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I know I’m a Druid, but bats...Eesh...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat hisses at Dieter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sends his bat down the first hallway to inspect past the taper.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat flies down the hallway.  A couple of minutes later, it comes back.</p><p>(Animal handing check, with advantage.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “There there Dieter, we’ll get you over your Chiroptophobia one day.”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat lands above the wizard and, telepathically, relays what he saw.  There were two bedrolls, moth eaten and dusty.  Silver ore veins ran rampant through the far end of the tunnel.  The taper stops several feet in, good silver available there.  There is something strange, though, at the beginning of the narrowing.  Something...  empty.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: thinks to the bat *does your sonar detect anything behind the walls?*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You receive - "Walls too thick."</p><p>(Is Dieter at the mouth of the tunnel by chance?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>When the bat returns, Dieter casually, but obviously, wanders away from the bat and toward the taper.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception for Dieter.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Take care that way my friend. The bat tells me there is something suspicious about those walls.

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter approaches the narrowing of the walls, the stairs off to the right become more and more evident.  The reason being is that Dieter now can hear snuffling and scratching coming from down that corridor.  The stairs go down at a very steep angle.</p>

<p>The druid and the wizard, although going quickly, investigate the area thoroughly.  The two cannot tell if the human is Douglas or not, but they take the corpses features down to relay them to the people in the town, just in case.  The ore veins will take a few hours to mine, the best that you could hope for at the point is to take a few hours and get 6 pounds of ore for the both of you.  (Approx 6 gold).  There is a curious section that looks like it has already been mined, but dirt and debris was piled back up quickly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Douglas, in my worry, I’ve quite forgotten my own injuries...and now I am in need of rejuvenation. Would you be a mensch and stand guard while we recover?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Hey friend," Douglas says, easing Dieter down.  "I got it from here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter gingerly sets down in a shadowy corner and offers Douglas a torch from their packs.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Much appreciated."  He grabs the torch from Deiter and a scimitar from a fallen gobin and sits at the top of the stairs.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, feeling exposed, but incapable of caring particularly much about it, blacks out in exhaustion. His dreams are filled with muffled gnashes of teeth and strange languages emanating from shapeless forms...</i></p>

<p><i>Slowly the two adventurers rise to the rhythmic sound of Douglas sharpening his blade. Their eyes meet and they seem to instantly recognize that they each have grown significantly as a result of this venture. A slow grin breaks across Dieter's face...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "That was a close one there Mao old friend! Am I deceived or do you look to have gained more than rest just now?"
Maouelue: "Aye, that was a dark walk I would rather not soon repeat, though in my tango with termination I have tallied new territories of the unconscious. Indeed I *also* feel a new aura emanating from you dear Druid..."
Dieter: "As I dreamed, I felt the coastal waters of my homeland pushing and pulling over me. The sands shifting illusively from stone to sand to glass and back again. I feel the endless flow of time rippling through me as a conduit..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The adventurers look to Douglas and ask whether he is keen to push a bit further into the mine, to put an end to this 'Boss' and avenge the desperate souls who lay slain in the chambers above.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, we can traverse the mines.  Not much to them, really, this part at least.  This is a fairly new dig.  There is a much bigger one across the hills, still a part of the Krytos Hill system.  I was there for a little bit, bunch of Dwarves in charge over there.  Here it was every man for hisself.  There something in particular you wanting to see, friend?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I would rest easier knowing we have cleared these halls of any more dangers. I would like to relay to the townsfolk we have made this mine safe for the time being. Mayhaps we can return to the other side across the hills in the coming days to uncover more about this violent intrusion."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Definitely. Let us be certain about the safety of this mine. Thereafter I would like to consult with my order. Keep your eyes open for anything useful we might take back in this cart."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three of you roll the cart through the East tunnel of the Krytos Hill mine, putting bits in that you think might be useful.  There are some smallish silver nuggets, shovels and pickaxes, various miner-related gear.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the cart is being wheeled out to the main cavern area, you notice the campfire has completely gone out, there is no smoke emanating from it.  The bedrolls are still there, bites have been taken out of it, rips and tears that indicate of animal habitation.  The morning sun is peeking through the entrance, slightly shrouded as it is still fairly early.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Where did you want to go?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Dieter, do I recall correctly there was a silver vein down that first tunnel, whence we tumbled down the slope?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Are you suggesting we go and mine a bit more for our troubles?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Ha! You needn't be a telepath for that, truly!"

<p>Dieter slips down the last few stairs, but Maouelue and Douglas right him.  As you enter this further tunnel, you see the carnage from the day previous.  The smell hits you, then you notice the carrion scavengers around.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes a closer look at the scavengers trying to discern their species.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They're actually kind of a mixed breed.  Rats bred with some other type of vermin.  They're not currently hostile toward your party.</p>

<p><i>Dieter, chastened by his earlier brazenness wants to try and determine whether these creatures might be able to alert them to any potential ambush points in and around the cave.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter doesn't get words, more pictures and feelings from the animals.  They send a lot of struggling with their fellows, scavenging for food and shelter where they can.  They can to this cave, drawn by the smell, only very recently.  They only know the layout of this room, and the garbage pile a few tunnels over.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They do not sense nor have they seen any other living creature in these tunnels.  They've seen a lot of dead ones, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter attempts to tell them that his party means them no harm and they are just here as ore scavengers. He then nods to his party to move over to the silver vein and begin mining.</i></p>

<p>Your group digs for some time, narrowly missing stepping on these strange creatures that always seem to be underfoot.  A few hours in, you stop for a break.  Just as you all start again, Douglas's pickaxe lands on something wooden.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Maouelue rush over, and Dieter immediately remembers that there was a strange crevice or depression in the rock wall that they meant to investigate.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You all dig in this one spot, finally uncovering an old chest.  Decorated in gothic iron scrollwork, it reminds all of you of the classic pirates chest in stories of old.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a huge, gaudy lock on the front, banded into the wood by thick iron bands.  The thing weighs a ton.  It takes all three of you to pry it from the wall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What would you like to do?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter examines the lock looking at the shape of the keyhole/mechanism. He wonders who put this here and whether a means of opening this chest might lie in these halls.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue can't grasp the markings on the bands of iron, they're eroded away too much.  Something, some nugget of a memory pops into Dieters mind, completely unbidden.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He remembers a story of an artificer, a maker of magical items.  He was a sailor, a pirate really, who searched far and wide for a special magic that would make his items renown the world over.  Across the seas, a land of giants harnessed the power of runespells.  Their brand of runic magic was so powerful, it was said to imbue items with a life of their own.  They didn't use their magic for wealth or power, but mainly protection from the outside world.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This pirate found their enclave, slew their leaders, and forced the shamans of the tribe to divulge all of their secrets.  In the years that followed, not only did the pirate become rich and powerful, he became unstoppable.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There came a day that the crew became so frightened of him, half of them mutinied while the other half fled as fast as they could.  Alone, listless on the high seas, the artificer's last days are unknown to anyone.</p>

<p>The party heads back to Oakhurst, the small town where you first met Culver and heard about Douglas's plight.  As you crest the ridge of the hill and head into outskirts of the town, children see your party coming and run up to you, throwing questions at you left and right.  Some run ahead to tell the townspeople of your coming.  By the time the seven of you finally get into the town proper, you're legends.  The wealth in your cart is more than most people in Oakhurst see in a lifetime.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are questions upon questions upon questions.  Offers of free drink and food at the Pig and Falcon come from the owner and patrons alike.  Merchants come up to you offering their wares at a discount, slyly peeking at the glorious wealth in your cart.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Large casks of some oily substance have been broken over, the contents seeping over what is now refuse.  The walls have been gouged by implements of some sort, leaving long gashes throughout.  At one time a quaint metal candle holder hung from the ceiling, now it hangs askew, almost touching the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue, closing his eyes, starts to tap into the Weave to give him some insight into what happened in this humble shop.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In his mind's eye he starts to see ethereal, hooded figures move around the room, as if searching for something.  There are several figures behind the counter area in violence with a darkened figure on the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a hulking figure that comes in some time later, from the back, tears through the place, and grabs the figure on the ground by a leg.  Tossing the shape over its shoulder, it lumbers out the back again, the rest of the figures follow.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is now a cacophony of noise coming from outside the shop.  Douglas is not doing a great job on crowd control.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue *mutters*: “There was clearly a great fracas here. I see in my mind that there is more than mystery at play here.  We must rid ourselves of this crowd if we are to gain advantage on our prey.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
*Dieter strolls out the front door and addresses the crowd*

Dieter: “Good citizens. We can all see some foul deed has befallen our dear  neighbor. We must ask for your patience and vigilant watch  while we investigate this matter further.  

Look for news from us on the morrow. If any of ye should carry tidings, I bid ye leave them with the proprietor of The Pig and Falcon. 

Now get ye hence and may the light of The Seven be upon you. ”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crowd disperses, but reluctantly.  Many faces turn back over their shoulders, trying to glimpse what is happening.  Seeder remains behind a bit, but his father pulls him away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter motionlessly watches Seeder recede, until at last he disappears around a corner. At that instant Maouelue beckons the group silently to follow him off the street and around the back of Culver’s shop.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The other two men nod in acknowledgment and follow straight way.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I dared not speak more of it with so many around, but I fear that Culver has come up against something more than fancifully foul. There is a dark force behind this attack and my vision of a great— *was it a shapeshifter?*—form...leaves me with no comfort. We needs again quickly muster our strength, such as it is, and get out of town. We need to search the surrounding woods.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She picks up her head, interested.  "I've had occasion to silver some weapons.  I can make ewers or goblets, might take a bit 'o time, though.  I can do well with detail work, but the more detail, the more time I need.   What did you have in mind?"</p>

<p>The slings are sturdy but unremarkable.  The net, you now notice, is expertly made.  What is normally a gold piece at a regular city shop, and is typically made of rough rope, this...  Fine leather strands mixed with hempen rope twine is interweaved with multihued gossamer thread the likes of which you've never heard of before.

<p>The farmlands pass to thick dales of grasslands, several animals graze at their leisure.  In sort order a copse of trees comes into view.  Beyond that, much larger and darker trees take over the skyline and the forest proper starts.  An eerie feeling comes over the group as rain clouds, travelling towards the party, appear over the trees.</p>

<p>A murder of crows can be seen high on the branches of the trees as the group enters the forest.  There is a piece of bark nailed to the first tree.  Dirt obscures the words scrawled on it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter says this, a crack of lightning breaks.  The forest is illuminated for a brief second and several screeches are heard from over heard.  A moment later, thunder rumbles.  A darkness settles over the forest with only the torchlight for guidance.  For the moment...</p>

Dieter: “Aye, this storm appears to be charging in earnest! Make haste for the...well...Trix...whoever she may be.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The irony of the mysterious merchant’s name only now settles upon Dieter. At hearing the name aloud in this way Maouelue furrows his brows, if possible, deeper than they had already been. His pace falters for a few steps before he resolves to press on.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With nothing else for it, they book it for the creepy domicile.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thunder and lightening crash.  Dieter catches his bearings and just as he's about to run, the illumination from the lightening shows them a figure beckoning them to the structure.  They bolt, splashing through the mud and water into the strange building...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Brb 😁)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party stumbles in, almost on top of themselves, into the foyer of an... interesting abode.  From the outside, it looks smallish.  A combination of a ramshackle shed with a colorful peddlers cart with what seemed to be a circus boxcar attached in the rear.  When you enter in, however, you all see a cozy, if earthy, entrance with strange baubles and bobs hanging from the ceiling and in various bowls scattered hither and thither.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A wide set of earthen steps descends to a sitting room set with wicker chairs around a roaring fire.  A table with a bubbling pot stands to the right, no clear source of heat underneath it.  Herbs, fungi, a complete assortment of plants and other particulars are scattered everywhere around the table, and, truthfully, the room in general.  The ceiling is higher in this main sitting area, and no rain is getting through.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>To the left, standing stock still, hands clasped in front of her, is a beautiful young maiden.  Hair as black as pitch, clothes patchworked but otherwise clean and neat, she is a vision save for bits of dirt marring her stark white skin.  She looks to be middle age, but when you look again, she looks to be barely an adult.  She waits patiently for you all to enter, eyes unblinking.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(God, I love this game!!)</p>

Maouelue: “Pardon our intrusion...young...lady. We were referred to a certain Trix in search of restoratives for our coming venture. Might you be the one for whom we search?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he speaks, he subtly examines the young woman, not fully believing the facade she presents. He has seen a hag or two in his days and his arcane senses tingle...or did that last lightning strike come a little TOO near?</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, who has always been a bit vulnerable to beauty, unwittingly slackens his jaw. Whatever he had been expecting, this figure is not it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman nods her head.  "M' name is Bellatrix, but the townsfolk call me Trix.  Why do you come so deep into the woods to find me?"  Her eyes, still unblinking, you can see have an odd greenish tint to them.  Unnaturally bright green, reminiscent of firebugs at night or the pallor of a sickly person.  She seems healthy, though.  (Perception check for more.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard doesn't catch it, but Dieter notices Douglas acting very nervous.  He's grabbing his left elbow with his right arm, not making eye contact with anyone, and not looking around at anything.  There is so much to see in this place, it just strikes Dieter as strange.  He also notices several potion bottles ready to be stoppered.  They're red, swirling, and you know them as potions of healing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We come seeking potions of healing and to be honest I have an academic interest in the *Arcane*...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We have silver, albeit a bit...clumpy.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She laughs, looking at the floor for a beat.  She makes her way to the table, stoppers four bottles, and bring them to Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles and says to Maouelue, "I'm sorry, goodsir, I don't study in the arcane much.  Mine is a...  different type of magic.  Some shy away from it, but it has been with me and my family for years upon years, generation upon generation.  A curse, some would tell you.  It has served me well, though.  And hopefully it serves you well, too."  She nods to the bottles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the bottles in hand and offers fair payment. Maouelue’s eyes gaze piercingly into Bellatrix’s. He has an inkling of what she might mean, but is eager not to let on to his fellows the precarious nature of their visit.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We are also in need of information, should you be so inclined kind *maiden*. We are tracking a group of kidnappers who have made off with a key member of our community; Culver, if you know of him. We are honestly short on clues and have only just now completed our provisioning.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He nods at the armful of potion bottles with which Dieter is wrangling.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her smile fades.  She looks at the silver ore and gives it back to Dieter.  "Although it is very much appreciated, kind sir.  I have no such use for silver or gold, though."  She shrugs and says, in a soft voice, "No place to use it."  She looks at Maouelue, studying him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, after an uncomfortable minute or so, she says, "Do you by chance have anything of Culver?  A piece of clothing of his?  Hair?  Something he owns?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Surely you *must* require some form of payment?”
Maouelue: “Sadly we have nothing of Culver’s. The closest we have is this map of the nearby mine, but that was only ever *close* to Culver, not his directly.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas says, "Beggin' your pardon, miss...  um...  I... uh...  I have this... uh...  I have this trinket...  and, um...  and it... uh...  it belonged to Culver, ma'am."  He audibly gulps and holds out a small knife.  "Borrowed it some time back," he says to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two adventurers glance quickly at Douglas then at each other, then the witch, and back to Douglas again. Flabbergasted at this turn of fortune.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix smiles at the flustered man, nods as she takes the token.  To Dieter, she says, "We can discuss payment.  Let me see what fate lies in store for Culver.  Then we shall see what payment will be."  She takes the knife over to a darkened corner of the sitting room.  She pulls a dark cloth from what the group can see is an elaborately ornate mirror.  It gleams pristine in the firelight, not a mark or speck of dust is on it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s eyes darken and he assumes a brooding posture.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a bit)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Same)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix pinches the knife by the hilt, letting it dangle point downwards.  She holds it in front if the mirror.  She touches its opposite...</p><p>The reflection of the inside of the woman's house fades into dark clouds.  The clouds roil for a few moments, and when they clear, a scene emerges that is unnerving.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The view is several feet away, looking down on a bloodied Culver.  His hands are locked in manacles bolted to the wall above his head.  His clothes are tattered.  His head hangs to his chest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party gasps each with their own peculiar terrors reflecting in their minds.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The surroundings are dark, dismal.  Some type of cell.  A metal clink is heard, and an unseen entity unlocks the manacles, letting Culver's hands fall to the floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The view follows the Culver being dragged by his hands out of the cell, through a series of dank hallways, and finally thrown onto a wooden floor in front of a chair.  The chair is occupied by a tall man, his features are obscured.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A laughing voice asks Culver, "What did you think we would do, Big Dove?  Eh?  Just tell me where he is and we can finish all of this!  You can go home, clean up your shop!"  Laughing from around the room greet this statement.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell me where he is and who's working with him and you can walk out of here!  C'mon, man!  Let's get this <i>over</i> with!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter casts a furtive glance back at Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Culver moans.  He opens his eye, the other is swollen shut.  He pauses a moment.  Then spits blood at the  man in the chair.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room erupts in laughter.  Dark, deep, booming laughs, almost as if they were hoping for this action.  The man in the chair, the most jovial of all, steps closer to the man on the floor, kneels down, and now a full view of the man is available.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He has slicked back dark hair, thinning in front.  An almost handlebar, bushy moustache covers his pale face.   A few scars on his cheek and forehead mar his otherwise fairly handsome face.  Debonair, even.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks down at Culver with a smile that doesn't touch his eyes.  He grabs the man on the floor by his throat.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a man in dark robes runs over to the mustachioed man and whispers in his ear.  His eyes go wide and he yells at the robed man, "WHERE?!  Find it!  End it NOW!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix drops the knife and the mirror turns back to its reflective surface.  She's breathing heavily and looking worried.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
*Maouelue furrows his brow gravely and pulls Bellatrix’s face to meet his gaze.”

Maouelue: “What happened! Those men...did they see?”

Dieter: “WHERE’S...CULVER?

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The companions are agitated and fretful at this nefarious revelation.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks genuinely shaken.  She takes a shuddering breath.  "I have no idea where that was, I didn't recognize anyone in the vision.  Did any of you?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at Maouelue.  "They knew I was scrying on them.  They had a mage there that detected it.  I thought that was impossible."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Have they seen us? Was the spell reversed?..”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We need to move. If anyone has seen any of those men before, speak now. There is no *time*.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix shakes her head, "No, I ended the scry when I felt him searching for it.  They haven't seen us and I don't believe they can reverse the spell."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas has been strangely quiet.  Could be that he's shy.  Could be something else.  (Perception check.)</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, I think they're talking about me.  It's probably about those rune coins.  I recognize the man, but I have no idea who he is.  Just know him by reputation.  He's the one who originally sent us to the mine, wanted to find out more about those coins.  But after months of digging, we only found a handful.  No idea what he wanted, but it sounds like he's seriously angry about me not checking in.  Don't know why he would take it out on Culver, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Hmm...we’ll speak more of these rune coins on the road. Tell us where we need to go Douglas, on Culver’s life!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't know, I honestly don't!  I wish I did, I...  I couldn't stand seeing Culver like that..." His voice breaks.</p><p>"I might know where I can get info, though.  We have to get back to Oakhurst."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Quickly! No time to waste!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The rush toward the door Maouelue looks back at Trix’</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Come with us... Lend us your magic to help this man avoid a terrible fate.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She lowers her head, "I'm sorry, I cannot leave here.  I will continue to work to find Culver.  If I find anything else, I'll send word into town.  Be safe.  Come find me if you need any more supplies."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “My lady...”
*He lowers his head in respect and turns, ushering the group out the door.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Yeah, okay!)  Everyone follows Dieter.  Douglas sees something coming closer to him, but the group is moving so well, the thing is left behind quickly.  The edge of town comes into view, and the pace is picked up.  Right at the entrance to town, by The Bending Oak, the crew stops to catch their breath.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Maouelue: "Fool of a Deleter! Next time throw yourself in and rid us all of your stupidity!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas says, "How about this, we'll split up.  I'll take one of you and go around back, meet my contact.  The other can give this crowd what it wants, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(Based on the rolls:) Douglas and Maouelue go around the back way, silent as the grave, nary a one to see them.  Dieter strides out after the two detach from the pack, waves his hand in the direction of the crowd and turns on his charm.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aw thank heavens! I could quaff a *free* pint or two for my troubles. It's been a HELL of a couple days."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter produces his trademark unnecessary flame in search of oohs and aahs.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue follows Douglas silently around back, rolling his eyes at his ostentatious companion, but smiling inwardly a bit as well, as we are wont to do with the ones we love.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A farmer, about seven drinks past his limit, first spies Dieter and his flame trick.  He is over the top flamboyant in his praise and awe.  He taps all of his buddies on their shoulders, getting more people into the throng of wonder.  More people from inside the establishment hear the commotion and try to barrel their way out to see.</p><p>(Performance check, if you want to do anything fancy!)</p>

<p><i>Dieter is not so used to wielding his flames in such small spaces, but he manages a passable flame formed bear for their amusement.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "These *flames* are makin' me thirsty!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hush rolls through the crowd when Dieter moves his hands rapidly around his ball of flame.  A bear appears, then grows, as Dieter plies his craft.  The bear grows to four feet high, amazing the people.  It moves forward into the tavern, carving a way for Dieter.  As he makes his comment, a roar goes up and a mug of ale is stuffed into your right hand, a strong smelling cup of something jammed into your left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two stealthy blokes enter in the rear of The Pig and Falcon silently, surprising the bulbous cook.</p><p>"Oy, you two!  Give a man a heart attack!  Can't you see I'm working me arse off here!  I don't need surprises, too.  Get outta here!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas nods to the cook and quickly heads to the busy main room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Not one to shy away from an adoring crowd, Dieter shows them his "drink two beers at once" trick.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(facepalm)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter... tries to do his trick, but these mugs are covered in a heavy lacquer and laden in grease.  One slips, then the other.  Most of the ale covers you, some of it douses the bear in a gout of sputtering smoke.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crowd goes quiet for a second.  Then a GIANT roar goes up, Dieter's back is slapped, and <i>three</i> more ales are set on the table for you.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Seems me bear needed a bit 'o honey as well. D'we have any *mead* about!?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another big cheer, and a mead in a large mug is set up in front of you.  One of the farmers calls for news of the minecart you rode in on.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas scans the area for his contact...</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Well I'll tell you folks, we've had a might fine time *using* summat silver! Eh!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>... and sees an obese man in clothes a lot finer than what you've seen in this town so far. He slowly makes his way over.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He then regales them with a bit of an exaggerated recount of their latest encounters.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just for fun, one more Performance, with advantage.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter keeps the majority of the crowd in rapt attention.  Some are being kicked out due to drinking too much, making a bit of noise to contend with you.  But the greatest number is rapt, listening to your tales.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter stumbles in his speech a bit and lets out a giant belch, rubbing his stomach thereafter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas taps the big man on the shoulder and whispers something in his ear.  The man, without looking at Douglas, pulls a piece of parchment out of his vest and hands it to Douglas.  Douglas looks at Maouelue, surprised and somewhat worried.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Should Douglas open the parchment here, or outside the tavern?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue flicks his eyes meaningfully toward the loos.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, stumbling a bit more now, seeks an open seat near the hearth.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, not picking up on the 'loos'...  My fault, I might be missing something simple?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotcha, it just clicked as you were writing!!  My bad!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, suddenly realizing he is famished, tries to catch the barkeep's eye.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas takes the nod, sees where Maouelue is directing, and heads there.  You catch him give the big man a backwards glance.  The man never looks at Douglas. (Perception check for more.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>!sb</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard and Douglas approach the loos.  Douglas pulls out the parchment, which is folded several times over.  He unfolds and looks at it, puzzled.  He shows it to Maouelue.  (History check.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is a dark blotch of ink in the middle of the page.  Nothing else, no writing.  Searching his memory, there is something there, something relating to the sea maybe?  The wizard can't quite put his finger on it, though.  Not precisely.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Meanwhile, Dieter, ever presentational, makes a show of ordering what seems to be enough food to feed 3 men, going on about how he hasn't had a bite in near a day and a half.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "We must get Dieter's read on this. Let us rejoin with him at the Sheep posthaste."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas nods.</p><p>The bartender, a harried man with sparse, flyaway brown hair and a sweaty complexion, nods as Dieter orders.  His eyes go wider and wider with each additional item.  He tries to interject a few times, but Dieter goes right through with his food order.  The people at the bar take notice and start cheering the druid on!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue whispers a few words to Frenchy and hand him the 5 silver coins he is carrying. The henchman circumnavigates the crowd over to Dieter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I keep forgetting about him!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Frenchy: "Aye, and a box for my inebriated compatriot here. Take this for your troubles."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Frenchy shows the silver pieces to the barkeep.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bartender, completely flabbergasted, calls to the cook the giant order, and says its to go.  The cook comes to the window and says, "WHO THE HELL ORDERED ALL THIS FOOD -- TO GO?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter *fairly yells, waving a finger demonstratively*: "Heroes is as heroes does!"

<p>The cook looks through the partition, sees it's Dieter talking and says, "Oh.  It's you.  Okay, but it's gonna take some time.  Gimme a minute."  And he trails off, going back to the kitchen.  The crowd cheers again.  Someone pulls out a handmade lute, a couple drums come out, and a flute-like instrument is produced as well.  Music and merrymaking begin at The Pig.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, picks his head up and is shaken to see a flaming bear in front of him. Realizing the increasingly dangerous nature of manipulating an open flame around so many people, he ends his conjuration and stifles a few large belches.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Frenchy steps back into a nearby corner and observes the bar as surrogate bodyguard for his summoner.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the bear is dispersed, you hear some groans from the audience, still intent on what Dieter is doing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Does Maouelue exit the tavern?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue tugs at the elbow of Douglas' shirt and beckons he follow out the back and toward the Sleeping Sheep.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, his precaution ebbing away, blurts out...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What news of our friend Culver?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(He says this while he's in the tavern?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Frenchy's ears and eyes perk up at the sound of Culver's name.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes, they are still waiting for their food.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue steps past the two large men, but Douglas slows, recognizing that they're with the obese man.  He slows, grabbing the sleeve of Maouelue.  They watch the progress of the men toward Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first plate of food hits the bar in front of Dieter, and the barkeep says to the Frenchman, "You know, 5 silver won't cover his <i>whole</i> order," and leaves in a huff to the kitchen.  Bar patrons shout after him for service.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The men saunter up to where Dieter is sitting, remove the patrons next to him at the bar, to much verbal violence.  They sit, staring straight ahead, not paying much attention to their surroundings.  Occasionally they'll pass a glance between them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A "Huzzah" goes up at the mention of another tune.  Douglas whispers to Maouelue, "The owner is the barkeep, Kennet.  Looks pissed, eh?"  The barkeep plops another plate down, this one greasy, fried fish bits and golden roasted potatoes.  The smell is heavenly.</p>

<p>One of them, a man with leathery skin, tanned from decades in the sun, comes over dragging one of the men, unconscious, by the shirt collar.</p><p>"This the one giving you grief, lad?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Aye that’s him...have a spare bit ‘o rope by chance?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ha, always!"  He goes around to his pack, pulls out some thick rope, and tosses it to you.  He kneels down, helping you hogtie the man.  The other one, with the scimitar, looks...  rough.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We should seek aid for this one. Let him regain consciousness and get what info we can. Keep them separated. We’ll interrogate them individually.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter has Frenchy and Douglas carry the bloodied man out the door and asks Frenchy to go to the Inn and remove the riches from the mine cart and bring it out to meet them in front of the Pig and Falcon.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, I've had enough fun for one night, lads.  Name's Sy, I run the Broken Skull Ranch north side of town.  You need any help with these'ns or anything else, come on out and see us.  Else I'll see you in town." He dons his hat, tips it, and starts ambling northwards with a few other farmers and ranch-hands.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Thank you Sy and many thanks to all those who helped us out of this jam. It was not our intent to cause such a fracas. Good to know there are honest folk in these parts.”

<p>Douglas is passed out from exhaustion just outside the tavern door, slumped in the dust.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Maouelue, without really speaking to each other, get a funny feeling that something at the end of the fight was off...  Nothing specific, but you both know that something was off.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Did that seem...a little too simple?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Now you mention it...”

<p>(Last night's game must have taken a lot out of me, I'm <i>tired</i> this morning!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue nears the Sleeping Sheep.  The commotion has died down, the Pig's doors are wide open, the barkeep cleaning up inside.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dude, last night was captivating. So much fun. I loved the flashback/foreshadowing dichotomy.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Maouelue approaches the Tavern he looks for Douglas and Frenchy.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Thanks, man!  That means a lot.  I was hoping it was enjoyable for everyone.  When I get a chance to play heavy-duty characters, I almost always have fun!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard looks for his other two companions.  Douglas is still passed out in the dirt in front of the tavern.  Frenchy is just starting to come out of the inn with the minecart, still laden with riches.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh he was supposed to empty the riches in the inn room)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Where is the brute who lay unconscious?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Okay, just to make sure I was reviewing correctly, there were two farmers who took the roughed up dude to Culver's.  Dieter and Maouelue took the trussed up guy there after, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter and Mao took the Hog-tied man to Culver's. Douglas was supposed to watch the beaten man and load him into the cart with Frenchy once he returned.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotcha, I'm up to speed now!!  Sorry about that!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you get closer, you can see Douglas, passed out, slumped against the side of the tavern.  The hog-tied man is nowhere in sight.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You mean the bloodied man? Hog tied is at Culver’s)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm all over the fucking place today, sorry brother.  Yes.  Bloodied man is gone, Douglas is slumped.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>( XD No prob)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "What fools have been. Our lack of discretion has cost us dearly."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue attempts to wake Douglas and bring him into the tavern. He sees Frenchy out of the corner of his eye and gestures for him to follow.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas slumps over further, a dark, wet red patch spreading over the bottom part of his dark tunic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's head drops as he lets out a low moan. Fearing what he will find, he lays the man down and inspects the man's apparent wound.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There's not much Maouelue can tell, he can't really get at the wound properly without taking off Douglas's tunic.  Moving him in this condition might be difficult and problematic.  You can tell, however, that his breathing is very shallow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He's panicking a bit now. He tells Frenchy to keep Douglas stable, then runs headlong into the tavern.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Frenchy does the best he can to staunch the bleeding, but there's no way for him to know if he's helping or hurting.  The wizard looks around, sees the barkeep sweeping inside.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Kennet! I am gravely apologetic for the melee here. Things...we just...lost control. I would help you restore order here and offer payment for the damages, but my man Douglas is bleeding out on your doorstep. Pray, can you provide him aid?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Persuasion check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He licks his lips and looks at you.  "Look at this place, will you?  I try to run a clean and honorable establishment, and you folks breeze into town, make havoc, and are carried out as heroes.  Leaving <i>me</i> to clean up the mess.  Just like always.  Adventurers.  Bah!"</p><p></p><p>He takes a beat, looks at the distress in Maouelue's face, and says, "Probably nothing a bandage and a good night's sleep won't fix.  But if you must, there is a priest of Ilmater at the parsonage down the way." (He points Northeast of town.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue *with barely suppressed rage*: Did you make a fair bit of *coin* for the folk *you* invited down the pub on account of us coming here with a cart full of silver? Don't act so innocent sir. We'll not darken your doorstep any longer. We'll be off in search of this priest..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue storms out of the bar, losing control a bit, he works with Frenchy to load Douglas into the cart as gently as possible. They make as much haste as they can while trying to keep the cart steady and head off toward the parsonage.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you travel down the road, nearing the dead of night, the events of the day seem to be getting to you.  You're feeling very tired and in need of sleep...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I fear...we may ourselves need to take our rest at the parsonage tonight if they'll have us. My legs grow heavier with every step. Will this series of nightmares end?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Maouelue sees a spooky blue ghost dwarf out of the corner of his eye!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(JK!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three travelers make their way to a run-down shack at the edge of town.  Nothing denotes it as a shrine, no symbols or totems decry it's patron.  A small woman sits out front, legs dangling off of a bench.  Her head is bowed, her hands clasped in her lap, fingers moving slightly over a simple metal item.  She is clothed in simple brown robes, with only a sash to designate her as an acolyte of Ilmater, the patron diety of suffering and sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue, staggering with exhaustion, shoves the cart a few feet away from the woman.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: <gasp> "...aid.....we need aid! Can you help us? My man here is dying and we are in dire need of a place to rest!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Without a word, the woman jumps down from the bench and comes to you.  Her smile is warm, her mere presence is soothing to you, calming you instantly.  She touches Maoulue on the arm, and a warmth spreads from her touch all the way through his body, bringing clarity and peace to the overwhelmed wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue lets out a large breath he didn't realize he was holding.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Silently she turns to the cart.  She peers in and her countenance changes to that of pity.  It's as if this hurt man, his pain, is causing her pain.  She reaches down to touch Douglas, her hands starting to stain red from his blood.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A yellow-gold glow starts emanating from her hands.  Seconds later, Douglas gasps, his breathing regulates, yet he does not come fully awake.   The glow recedes and she turns back to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He's very weak.  We have no full bedding here, but there are bedrolls inside.  Would you like him to stay here so I can look after him?"  He voice is soft, musical, and... sad.  Yet her smile has not faded an inch, even when she looked on Douglas with pity.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Yes...thank you. Thank you! For my part perhaps it is best to let you work in peace. I'll make my way back to the inn...I think I have strength enough for that. Could we leave this cart here and return upon the morrow to retrieve it?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Of course.  And you both are welcome to stay here with him, if you'd like.  Pardon my not mentioning before.  Ilmater's house is always available."  She bows to you, and starts to attempt to move the man in the cart.  She's about as tall as it, though, so it's proving a bit... awkward.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Frenchy, pray help this kind cleric then head to Dieter to explain what has happened. The lady is right, I can go no further tonight."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With the Frenchman's help, Douglas is brought inside and ministered to by the small woman.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's eyelids begin to close against his will. Only when he sees his man laid down do they finally shut, casting his mind into an unsettled darkness.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Cut to Culver's</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, seeing his companion trod off toward the tavern, slowly closes the door and turns to the bound man.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He kicks him roughly in the ribs.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Who the *hell* are you? Where's Culver?!?"

<p>(Intimidation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Blood spurts out of the man's mouth as he comes back to a hazy consciousness.  Looking around through swollen eyes, he sees Dieter and starts to laugh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Wracking, hacking coughs cut in, followed by more laughing.  He picks his head up and looks around.  He seems to recognize the place, even by the darkened interior, and starts guffawing, hacking, laughing, retching.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When he calms down, breathing heavy, he whispers something Dieter doesn't catch.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, raises an eyebrow at the man’s show of resistance. He leaves the man probe for a moment and searches the disheveled room for another spare bit of rope or any kind of cord.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do NOT google image hogtied...shudder)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around for rope and finds three different types.  With this being partly a fishing shop, there are many styles and lengths of fishing lines.  There are hempen ropes as in the style dungeoneers carry.  Lastly, there is a nasty bit of barbed rope.  Looks a bit like twine spliced with brambles every few inches.  Used typically to keep rodents away from produce.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Note taken!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter snorts in sadistic amusement as he grabs a length of hempen rope and pulls an end of it through the man’s bindings and ties it off securely. He then throws the other end over the hanging light fixture and tests it for load bearing by tugging on the loose end.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh...  why do I feel this is going to take a dark turn?!  What alignment is Dieter?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Dieter is about to hang it up, then realizes there is no way this thing is going to hold the man's weight.  It's about to come out of the ceiling bolting at any time.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The entire place is trashed.  If you took some time, you could make something.  You might be able to use magic.  Looks like there is a door to the back room, you might be able to use that, too.  The room just isn't yielding much in the way of what you need.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter growls in frustration, pulls the rope back and drags the man toward the back room</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He opens the door and inspects the surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This room was mainly used for business.  There's a desk that's been overturned on the far side, an window broken beyond it.  Parchment and papers are strewn all around, crunching under foot.  A large old wardrobe is in the corner, very thick, looks to be made of solid oak.  There also is a now tattered rug on the ground, but it looks to have been of a good quality when it was hale.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter lays down the rope for now, rights the desk and inspects the wardrobe.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man has stopped laughing at this point.  He bangs his head on the floor every now and again, though.  The desk produces nothing of interest, it's been ransacked well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first thing you notice about the wardrobe is, when you swing the doors wide, at the top of the doors, a two pronged hook is fashioned at the top.  You assume this for heavy pelts or coats used in the winter.  (Investigation for more.)</p>

Dieter: “We’ll see who’s dead and who’s laughing in the end.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hoists the man into the closet and hooks his bindings onto the hook. He closes the door in the man’s face and throws the net of invisibility over the wardrobe. He glances again at the rune cloth and tucks it into his pocket before hastening out to the front door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man was shouting as you were trussing him up.  When the net of invisibility went over him, not only did the entire wardrobe vanish, his shouts cut off as he was never there.  There were portions of the bottom that weren't covered by the net, but with the craziness of the room, it's hard to tell until the room is cleared.</p>

<p>Dieter looks to the stars.  He feels the weight of the day, aches start to reach into his muscles.  He is weary, emotionally and physically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s eyes, dark already, go completely black at these tidings. He starts walking toward the inn, then stumbles slightly. He leans an arm on Frenchy as they walk back toward the inn.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Dieter: “Goodby Frenchy, you three as well.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dreams of the adventurers are heavy, thick, like swimming through molasses.  Vague dangers are felt through layers of viscous fluid; words are muffled, faces are blurred.  All three, however, share an aspect of their dreams...  A ring of runes, moving in a circle.  Spelling out something ominous.  The laughing man from the scry can be heard every time the runes come.</p>

<p><i>Dieter is awoken by the crowing of roosters thoroughout the town. His eyes remain shut for awhile as his dream consciousness lingers on the runic circles and laughing voice. He opens his eyes slowly, and looks at the scene around him. Empty is the space where when he last laid eyes, there had been four thuggish mercenaries settling down for the night. He wondered if their...did they even have (spirits?)...if they lay there dreaming of a morning full of silver riches. He wondered about Frenchy. He reaches for the mirror just to touch something that had been part of the summoning, but refrained from looking. Some other time. He looks about the room checking over the supplies that had been strewn from the mine cart by the henchmen and setting them in order on Maouelue’s empty bed. Where was Maouelue? Frenchy...he had said something about the parsonage. “I should make my way there straight forth”, he thought. Reminded of his friends, he draws forth the runed cloth in his pocket, pondering the similarity of those in his dream. He stands there for a moment transfixed. Then, with a backward glance at the pile of silver and tools, heads out and locks the door behind him. He makes haste for the parsonage.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter walks through town to the parsonage, after inquiring directions with Denson.  The streets are sparse but the people that see you wave in happy greeting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On approach, Dieter almost does a double take at the hovel that Denson directed him too.  In the light of day, it's barely more than some warped boards fit together, possibly not even nailed down.  A basic bench is outside; a small woman sits, lips moving in quiet prayer.  There is no door to the building.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I keep on going from second to third person, is that okay?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Impromptu meeting. Will reply shortly)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries about the PoV. I think it works.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Top of the morning madam. I am Dieter, Dieter Deleter and I've been told that you have given aid to a couple of wounded and weary adventurers. Theyare my companions...What news of their condition?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods in welcome, says, "Well met, traveler.  I do have new of your companions.  Come with me."  She hops down off the bench, waves you in as she enters the hovel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is a small space, you see some makeshift windows on the left and right wall.  Against the back is a small table with various items adorning it.  There are bedrolls stacked in a corner.  Against the right wall, huddled in bedrolls, are Maouelue and Douglas.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard's mouth is agape, nearly snoring.  Douglas is laying on his back, red-splotched bandages on covering his midsection.  His tunic was hastily bundled under his head as a makeshift pillow.  His breathing is regular.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your wizard friend is fine, just over tired.  The other man was deeply cut, possibly through to organs, there was quite a bit of damage.  The knife was serrated, as well.  He did not have a very good night's sleep, but I did what I could.  He's stable, breathing, and taking the healing I can give, so that's a positive.  If I can get liquids into him throughout the day, he should bounce back quicker."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would like to go and see about more bandages and some cleaning solution for the wound, would you like to stay while the awake?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Yes...yes. Thank you. I'll watch over them."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Recollections of last night's drunken escalation flash through Dieter's mind and he feels a deep pang of guilt and sorrow as he looks down on the victims of his rashness.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He bends down, taking a closer look at Douglas, then with a steely exhale, he touches Maouelue's shoulder.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Awaken, weary wizard. We would do well not to waste one waking wink, if we would weather this worry, wrangle our wisdom, and wrestle with wrath."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's eyes open groggily, and a thin smile widens on his face.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "What a wonderful welcome! Wise words!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They turn to look at Douglas</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “What a woeful wan he wears...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Will we wager our worth he will be wholly well...or wither?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We will wait, watch, wish.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both let out a long “Wheeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter appears lost in thought. He idly produces a flame and unconsciously rotates through the rune shapes that have haunted his recent waking and dreaming hours.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue stirs as he sees the symbols...His eyes glass over slightly and he involuntarily begins to trace the runes with an incredibly thin ray of frost.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The fire and ice begin to create a waving mist around the runes which begins to distort the air as a mirage in the desert.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Now that they are rested...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trance leads down psychic bends, twists, turns.  Visions mentally fly by the two, trying to come together in some semblance of understanding.  Both are  trying, straining to make sense of their shared dreams.  Suddenly, the trance breaks...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And they see a piece of parchment next to Douglas is on fire.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Where is the purple cloth?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(In Dieter’s chest pocket.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter also feels a sudden heat in his chest pocket.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees Dieter wince and looks down at his coat pocket. He reaches out with his icy hands and attempts to free the now-glowing rune cloth.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue extracts the cloth and sees that it is somewhat waxen, so it's not completely up in flames.  However, it is hot to the touch and in need of the cooling touch of the wizard. </p><p></p><p>The runes stand out on the cloth a yellow-gold, almost searingly bright.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter attempts to snuff out the flaming parchment with a few drops of water from his skin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The flame goes out, but the parchment is scorched beyond recognition.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks for any nearby container he might use to contain the pieces of the charred sheet.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The table holds some odd knickknacks.  A handknife, a pearl of decent size, a couple coppers, and a strange necklace.  The necklace has a burnished and rust-scarred pendant that lies open.  The pendant is ovoid and hollow on the inside, it looks as if it could carry ashes or something of the like.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception checks, please!!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is preoccupied at the moment, but the wizard is very perceptive this morning.  He hears screaming coming from the farther down street, from the heart of the village.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Mind our friend here a moment. I need to check something outside."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He moves quickly to the door, opens it, and peers down the lane seeking the source of the scream.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue peeks out from the doorway, there are several people running toward the center of town.  Some folks are bringing buckets of water, some two at a time, running towards what Maouelue can see is smoke billowing from somewhere down the street.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With a cursory glance back at his preoccupied friend, he exits and closes the door behind him, then runs full speed down the street directly toward the smoke.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few steps outside the parsonage, a very beautiful young woman locks eyes with you as she's running towards your end of town.  She makes a beeline for the wizard.  As she gets closer, she says, "Are you Maouelue, the man with Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...Who asks?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"My name is Kirra, I'm Denson's daughter.  He sent me to find you.  There's been an accident in your room.  We need you or your friend's help, please!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Accident?..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hastens his pace and joins the maiden.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes!  Please come, quickly!"  She takes off toward The Sleeping Sheep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue follows apace.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both come around the corner, bumping into more people as the crowd from the other night seems to have just shifted buildings.  This morning, however, no one is in a jovial mood.  They're running a bucket brigade to put out a fire emanating from the side of the Sleeping Sheep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue, the budding frost mage, shouts for the crowd to stand aside and immediately begins to channel a ray of frost at the blaze, attempting to contain the outer edges of the fire to prevent the spread.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shakes his head.  "Looks like a good deal of damage.  Was there anything expensive left in your rooms, goodsir?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Not at all dear Denson. It is my woe that our presence has so disrupted the community and caused this wreckage. Might be that our wooden tools could be wrecked, but I reckon the ore will only be the better for it. It seems fate has done well to call our company away from here..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, I'm glad of that, too.  I have to be off, need to talk with the town elders, see about repairing the damage as soon as we can.  Please let Kirra know if you need anything, or happen to find out what caused it all."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Denson...before you leave. There is a matter I would have you take up with the elders..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It would seem that our presence here hath brought some form of wealth through our efforts out at the mine..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"However, it is also clear that, whether it was here prior or not, we have also drawn out foul actors and in turn share some responsibility for the fate of the town and its people..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"With good faith, I would use this silver to settle our debts and grievances with the good merchants and proprietors and do one better..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We met a young boy in the street yesterday...He said to us, <i>We take care of our own here, m'lord.</i>..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah...  Aye, aye goodman Wizard.  I'll be sure to relay your interests to the Council.  They would be very happy to hear of your interest to protect the town."  He bows low to you.  "Mell met, kind sir.  Kirra, please let me know if these men need anything."</p>

Maouelue *turns to the crowd*: "Good people! I bid you all heed my words. Dark forces are stirring. We know not remotely where these events might lead us, but fret not. Together...we will root out these nefarious actors. Prithee keep a vigilant eye and look to each other while the Council takes its decisions."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Go now and secure your homes and lands. We will address the town thereafter."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The milling crowd lets out a tired but heartening, "Huzzah," and quickly goes back to their respective daily grinds.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Kirra says to Maouelue, "You have quite a way with words, Master Wizard.  And we very much appreciate what you've said you'll do for the town.  If you pardon my asking, why do you think an evil has beset Oakhurst?  We're not much to speak of."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Who knows the minds of those bent to the will of evil...yet, we have had some cause for concern. Dark dreams...a scrying vision. Yet, I dare not say more here in this exposure. Let us retire to more private chambers, but first...I bid thee, look into this glowing silver...what do you see?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh...  My, okay.  Let me see..."  She steps gingerly into the wreckage of your former room, taking care not to step on anything smoking or water-logged.  She squats on her haunches when she gets near to the pile of now dimly glowing coins.</p>

<p>"There's something written on these.  On all of them. But I... I can't quite...  No.  I can't make it out at all.  Looks to be some other language.  Are these your coins?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...I don't seem to remember leaving coins. Silver yes, but coins?...I must ask too much of you. I dare not look into those markings before I know more. I seem to be...particularly affected by runes connected to this mystery. Have you a strong container, perhaps made of metal that would contain these coins? We need to clear the room of these and my band's possessions. Dieter will want to know of this as well."

<p><i>Maouelue summons a fey arctic fox, takes out a book, pen, and ink from his backpack, then quickly scrawls a message relaying these events to Dieter, bidding him to join them in the drawing room of The Sleeping Sheep as soon as possible. He tears the page out and quickly rolls it up, then places it in the fox's trap. He then touches a glowing blue spot in the middle of its forehead with his thumb and forefinger, telepathically directing the fey creature to bring this at once to Dieter at the parsonage of Ilmater.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sits in ritual to produce a fox companion.  As he does so, Kirra searches The Sheep as well as surrounding shops for a metal container for the coins.  She comes back to the wizard disheartened and empty handed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I could find no metal box that would work for what you want.  There is a metal coffer Kentham owns, it is too small for this amount, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I see...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He scribbles on another page “...bring your net...” and tucks it inside the other message roll, then sends the fox hence.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The wizard begins to gather a load of the other materials and meets Kirra’s eye in search of direction to the room of her choice.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh...  Um... Through here.  You can use our gathering room."  She leads you to a larger room guests use as a dining hall.  It's a decent sized common room, with some recessed corner tables you can use to set up shop.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Thank you mistress. Would it be too much to ask of you to mind the coin pile while I secure the rest?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Of course, I would be happy to.  Would you like me to bring you anything before I do?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>You first see the blood on the bandage recede.  Douglas's eyes flutter.</p>

<p>(Ah, I see, if it’s something you want to try, I’m happy to test it out.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes Douglas’s head in hand and gasps, “My friend!”</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He's not very strong yet, holding his head feels like holding a heavy, unbalanced melon.  His eyes flutter some more, then, slowly, they open.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Douglas! Who did this to you my good man?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks around the room with his eyes, not daring to lift his head yet.</p><p>"I... didn't see his face.  He came outta nowhere.  Put the knife into my gut.  When he pulled it out, I screamed and...  then everything went black.   How long have I been out?  Where are we?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We are in the parsonage of Ilmater. You’ve just spent the night. The man you were watching. What if him?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He was still passed out when I sat down against the Pig to rest my eyes."  He breathes heavily.  "Guess that was a pretty bad idea, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “The only bad idea was ours. We should have taken rest directly after returning from the mine. I have more questions for you, but we must find Maouelue first. There is dark magic about. These runes...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter reaches for the rune cloth in his pocket only to recall that it is still in Maouelue’s possession.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Where *is* this cleric?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What cleric?  Oh, right.  We're in Ilmater's parsonage.  If I could get some water, I think I might be able to try to get up."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter hands him what’s left of his waterskin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He drinks sparingly, making sure he doesn't over do.  Douglas winces as he sits up, but then looks surprised and takes the bandage off.  Underneath is a gash neatly knitting itself back together, the blood receding as if being erased.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wow! Thank you friend.  Those bottles are better than gold!  So," he says, getting up, "What should we do now?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then he remembers he has his mess kit in tow. That should do nicely to gather up the parchment ashes. He dares not leave them behind, so he opens up the tin box and brushes the ashes into the cup before resealing and stowing the box in his pack. He still feels oddly compelled by the amulet, but will not sully the good will of the Ilmater by taking it unbidden. He casts a fleeting glance back at the locket, then says to Douglas,</i></p><p>“Let’s go now and find Maouelue...then break our fast while we consider our next course of action.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas gets up gingerly.  Patting himself down, checking to see his inventory, he frowns.  Then smile abruptly as he fishes out a few coins, drops them on the table.  "Not much, but I hope it'll do.  After you!  Oh, I'll have to stop by my rooms to grab a new tunic, too."  He stoops down to pick up his blood sodden shirt.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Are you staying at the Sheep as well? I say, you have followed us unquestioningly into peril in the name of Culver. I would understand if you took your leave of this mess..”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They leave the building and begin walking back to the inn as they continue to converse.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Pinned a message.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, I stay in a barn, southwest of town.  Farmer's real nice.  Since I'm just passing through, I wasn't planning on spending too much money or setting up shop at The Sheep.  I was mainly at the mine most of the time anyways.  If it's all the same to you, I'd like to stick with you guys?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We welcome your company with open arms...and if I could make a casual observation, you seem to have a part to play in this yet. What do you know about those men?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Which ones?!  There seemed to be thugs every time I turned my head!"  He shrugs, good-naturedly.  "The ones in the lady's mirror, I couldn't tell much.  Only know the moustache man vaguely.  Saw the big man at The Pig last night, he had his goons with him.  I recognize them, but I'm not high up enough on any ladder to know names," he chuckles.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There's a lot of people that work for the big man; some that live in town, some that don't.  Either way, seems like he's working for someone, too.  Could be more than one person, but the talk I've heard is that Moustache is the boss.  Nothing gets done without his okay."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I see...let us take care then not to draw attention to ourselves and our mission...though...I suppose I should avoid free ales for a while...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter lowers his head in a show of mild embarrassment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah...  I never got one of those last night!  Too busy...," he starts patting his pockets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Dieter, you didn't happen to see..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You didn't happen to see a piece of parchment paper, big spot of ink on it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I can’t say I have, not unless, well...there was a piece next to you on the table, but...it burned. We...there...was this circle of runes...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter trails off as his eyes cloud over slightly and his complexion darkens a shade.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It burned?  Hmm.  Strange.  And the runes, are they like the ones on the coin I showed you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Coin?...wait...<i>in the mine!</i> I knew I had seen their like...  what do they mean? You mentioned you were searching for them. “</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah, that's the reason some of us were there.  Besides the ore veins.  The big man came up to me one night in the Pig, asked me if I had found any of those coins.  Laid down five gold, said, 'There's more where that came from, bring me more of these coins when you find them,' and that was it.  I have no idea what they are or what they mean.  I don't read runes, and I didn't ask the big man.  He's not an 'answering questions' type, anyways, know what I mean?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter frowns gravely</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dark deeds, runic circles, mystical convergence...we must be wary. Fel things await those who delve too deep into the magical unknowns of this world.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He reflects on something.  "Huh...  I would think those would be the thugs that had Culver, but we saw him with Moustache..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to get the message from the fox here. But I also don’t want to overstep on the storyteller role. What’s the protocol for that kind of thing?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perfect!  I'm contouring the story around you.  We're not in a written adventure at this point, just riffing, so feel free to do what you want.  I have some ideas and hooks for you, but for the most part this is all where you want to go!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter considers this for a moment, his gaze is drawn to a glimmer of blue-white light streaking toward him from down the lane. As it draws nearer, its form becomes clearer. It appears to be a sort of fey fox. It sprints directly to him and holds its mouth slightly agape. He appears to be offering a small scroll held in his trap.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers curiously at the beautiful, unearthly creature and slowly reaches for the roll. As he stretches it out, a second piece of paper falls to the ground. He stoops to pick it up and sees the message “...bring your net...”. With a furtive glance over at Douglas, he quickly reads Maouelue’s message on the larger roll. His gaze lingers on the paper for a beat, then he turns to address Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Douglas, ill tidings from Maouelue at The Sleeping Sheep. Pray, hasten to your rooms and gather what you need then rejoin us at the inn.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Will do, meet you there." He dashes away toward his lodgings.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter walks at a steady pace toward the inn until Douglas is out of view, then he turns and sprints instead to Culver’s shoppe.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he approaches the building, he casts a few furtive glances around, wishing to avoid the watch of any passers by.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You got the first one, that's fine.  I've rolled a ton of times with other characters in my other games!  It's rough jumping back and forth.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around, believing he has been unseen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He enters the building and locks the door behind him. Seeing the scene of destruction again in the morning light kindles his inner rage once more. With a steely grimace, he makes his way to the back room.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he enters, he surveys the scene, he is keen to determine whether anyone has disturbed his...secret.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter scans the scene.  Everything looks the same as you left it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He moves over to where the armoire had been and reaches out, feeling for the cords of his net.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>... he grips them...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Creating some strange tension!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls the net back and folds it up, then straps it on the underside of his pack. He lets out an ice-cold breath through pursed lips, then pulls the wardrobe doors ajar.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wardrobe swings open easily.  The furs are still on the floor of the cabinet.  The man is gone.  On the back wall, just as the previous cloth was hanging by a bolt, you see a piece of parchment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On it, a large ink dot can be seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s form wavers for a moment, his shirt seems to stretch as his body swells slightly. He lets out a furious ROAR before shrinking back down to size again. He takes the bolt and parchment down and tucks them in his pack, then looks about the room and wardrobe again searching for any trace left by someone who could have set this man free. Surely the man could not have escaped without aid...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ooooo...  BIG Investigation check!!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(wooooooooooooooooooooot)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There is it.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In his rage, he searches through the area, trying to find any semblance of how the man could have left or who could have been sneaky enough to pull of the heist.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A green glow surrounds him as he peers into nooks and crannies, checks for footprints or markings, and tries to piece together the events of the man's escape.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a blinding mental flash, Dieter sees a hand drawing the spot on the piece of paper, hands clothed in dark gloves.  You see thin boots, well crafted, Eleven made, stepping lightly over everything, not making any prints.  Whispers of speech come to you, but are immediately hushed.  The speech was common, but the words you cannot hear.  There is a surge of magic as the two beings are together, then they aren't in the area anymore.  You feel as if a magic transportation spell was used.  But the thief didn't use a spell to get in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter gets closer to the wardrobe, hoping to find anything of use to identify these people.  And his eyes fall on a piece of parchment outside of the wardrobe.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
It looks to be a bill of sale, but something strikes Dieter as odd.  He picks up the paper, studying it.  Normal parchment and ink.  Then he reads:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Supply of ropes, cut to size of five feet each, 10 gold.  Order of barrels, wooden, iron banded, made to order, four foot height by three foot diameter at the middle, 25 gold. Branding iron with the lettering RM, 10 gold.  Order of potions, sleeping draughts, bought through (garbled writing), 150 gold.  Signed, Culver.  Purchaser signature, Veena.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Veena...hmm...damn these visions. Damn these entanglements!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He takes the bill of sale and places it alongside the other parchment in his pack. The small muscles around his eyes pulsate with fury. He then dashes out the door making haste toward the inn.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's a cool Pathfinder rule about research and history checks, basically anything a person can study for an hour or so.  Its called a 'Take 20'  where you basically take time to sit with something, pour over and research it, to gain knowledge about it.  I like it because, even if it doesn't give you a short rest or anything, it can serve to propel your exploration forward.  Or we can roll for knowledge of an object or topic, too.  Either way, let me know how Maouelue goes about his task.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue has been tirelessly moving the party's possessions into the drawing room. As he secures the last of the silver and heads back to the burned room, he thanks Kirra and excuses her from her vigil. He takes stock of the ornate chest and the pile of rune-embossed coins. He lowers himself to the ground and folds his legs in a lotus pose and begins to meditate on the items' respective markings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Survival check for how much is still salvageable.  History check for runic knowledge, Intelligence check for the coins.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a good bit of salvageable materials, surprisingly, in the room.  Along with the heads of several shovels and picks, Maouelue finds a few books intact.  Both packs are remarkably still functional, with all of their belongings in them!  Some furniture is able to be fixed, and Kirra has already set to work on fixing them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard sets to meditating, visions keep intruding, and he's not sure what they mean.  Water in a stream.  A dark basement, smelling of mildew.  Creaking wood.  A funny tasting cookie.  A pretty woman in a dark hooded cloak.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then the ring of runes comes into focus, glowing orange-red in the blackness of his meditation.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another rune pops out at him in recognition.  He can now make out <i>R-NEM-R-</i>.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Delving further and further into the meditation, possibly in frustration that he cannot piece together everything at the moment, he loses the thread and the calm fades.  The visions are chased away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Need to afk for now. I will try to throw a few things in here and there if I can.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the wizard comes out of his trance, Dieter appears outside the burned wall, eyes agape at the scene before him. He sees the pile of rune coins and his heart skips a beat. He calls out to Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What the *blazes* has happened here?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue picks up his head slowly</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Is this really the time for fire puns?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Oh...dear...unintentional...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Never mind. I’m in a foul mood. I can’t divine the meaning of these confounded runes...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Douglas...He do you remember the coin he showed us in the mine? The circle of runes we’ve seen, they must all be connected. I was...able to get some information from the brute, but I...couldn’t detain him indefinitely...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter recounts the details of what he found at Culver’s and tells Maouelue about the teleportation and the bill of sale. He conveniently leaves out his mild torture of the brute.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue appears deeply concerned. He relays his proclamation to Denson about forming a guild.</i></p><p><i>Dieter considers this a moment, a bit taken aback at first, then nods.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Yes. We need to grow our support against this cause. Let us hear what the council has to say. Douglas should be by straight way. Perhaps with our collective knowledge we can untangle some of this growing mystery.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two men wait for a few, tidying up and reviewing the bits of information they have collectively.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Around midday, Kirra comes in with foodstuffs and drinks.  Douglas follows shortly after, carrying a large pack on his back.  He has procured a shield as well; a solidly built oaken shield with the crest of the town on it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Hiya fellas!  What's to eat, I'm starving!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I would like to take our silver and this chest over to the Saynea at the forge.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Kirra, do you expect Denson to be much longer? We would do well to conclude our business in town and continue our search for Culver.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas, still stuffing bacon and biscuits in his pockets for later, says, "Right.  I'm on it," and exits hastily. </p><p>Kirra nods, saying, "He should be back any moment now.  Unless there were other things for the Council to discuss.  They're our elders of the town, and sometimes it takes a bit to get them all together at the same time.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A couple hours later, Maouelue and Dieter start to get a little worried, Denson still isn't back yet.  Minutes later, you hear loud banging from down the hall, towards the rooms.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both jump up at the sound and immediately go to investigate the sound source.</i></p>

<p>As they approach the damaged section of the building, hammering and sawing sounds grow louder.  The scene displays itself as a group of burly men handling lumber and tools, working at an extremely fast pace in rebuilding the fire-affected room.  Denson is there, directing the work.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Good Denson! Glad you’re back. Many thanks to fair Kirra for her hospitality while you were away. What news from the council?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Friends!  Looks like we'll have this back up and running in no time, eh?  Glad Kirra was able to assist you gentlemen.  As for the Council," he says, looking around, "let us away to a more secluded spot.  One with less ears, eh?!"   He leads you out of the room and to a locked door past the kitchens.  The room is comfortable for the three, chairs are offered.  Denson pulls a dark brown bottle of something and three glasses. He sets them out on the table, pours a thick amber liquid, and knocks the bottle against them, offering them up.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He swigs his in one, grimaces while he sets the glass back down.  He pours another while he starts talking. </p><p>"There are five elders of the Oakhurst Council.  They are all venerated members of this community; business owners, folks that have lived here their entire lives.  Which says a lot, because we're kind-of known as a transition town.  People come, people go.  Not too man stay, if you catch my drift."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Five make all of the government-type decisions facing the town.  They also tend to know the scuttlebutt before anyone else.  They keep things close to their collective vests, however.  The rest of us just find a way to...  work within their system.  Don't get me wrong, they are fair, good people.  They take a deep responsibility for this town. Their town.  With that being said, they'd like to meet with you.  Tonight, to be to the point."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I said I would ask you fellows.  There's no pressure, you don't have to meet with them if you'd rather not.  I did pass along your message, Master Wizard.  They are...  intrigued.  No one's really expressed interest, especially at this level.  I believe they want to share with you some information to help you...  To help solidify your choice.  Or not.  Guess it's up to you lads."  He smiles and sips at his drink.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue each take their drinks in one and set them down.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “We’ll meet them tonight. Could we beg one more small favor of you? There’s a chest in our room over there and we need a hand loading into  our mine cart. We need to head over to the smithy forthwith.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Pardon our haste, but we must not dally. Culver suffers dearly for each passing moment we delay. We have...seen it.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just got the kids to bed. I’d be down to do some more if you want.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, same here.  Such a process!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, you've seen Culver?  And he's hurt?  By all means, take what you need.  But, beggin' your pardon...  There was no chest in that room.  I scoured it thoroughly, and I didn't see a chest of any sort.  Nor any minecart.  I think that might have been a casualty, too.  Again, many apologies lads."</p><p>The chest was made of thick wood with iron bands.  The minecart was made of wooden walls with metal bracing on the bottom and metal wheel parts.  Maouelue found a good amount of metal left after the fire.  No iron bands or wheel bits, though.  The silver ore was strewn over the floor and the coins were in a pile in a puddle of water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oof didn’t see the notifications! Here I come!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Oh you needn’t worry about the cart. We left that down the parsonage last night. Douglas is went to get it and should be back soon. But no chest you say? Hmm. Well, we had best just gather what we can and be on our way. Thanks.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye!  Safe travels.  Oh, and be wary of the Muhlen sisters.  They can be... trying."  He smiles and ushers you out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As they open the door to leave, they see Douglas coming down the road with the cart and they proceed with the loading of all their possessions. As they do, they ask Denson if they can pay him some silver for his troubles.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Many thanks, gentlemen."  He bows to you both.  "Anything I can do to help, please let me know."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Quick clarification, did the rune coins disappear with the other stuff, or did we retain that? Been. A lot of prose today XD )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also how much silver did Denson take?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How much did you want to give him?!)</p><p>(You have a pile of rune coins and no chest...  Plus maybe one other one that you got from Douglas.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I kind of wanted to pay him a bit for damages. Not sure what seems reasonable, but maybe I’ll give him 5 nuggets)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group, eager to get on their way, pushes the cart quickly to the forge and seek Saynea to check on the status of their custom orders.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That'll work!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to get my weapons and kill bad guys now hahaha)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party makes their way to the smithee, minecart in tow.  The same steady hammering can be heard as before, however it has more pronounced notes.  Saynea is smoothing out some bits of Dieter's sword edge, forming the bevels and tempering it.  She looks up as the group comes in, and she smiles.</p><p>"Hoy there!  Glad you could stop by today!  Got some things to show you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I’m glad to hear it! There are foul folk about that I would have help us break these in!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She takes the large silver spheres out, shows them to Maouelue for his inspection.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes them in hand and looks over the smooth silver orbs.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “You are a fine craftswoman indeed Saynea. They are perfect!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bows her head. "Thank you kindly!  Here is the mold, as promised.  Any time you need more, come on back in."</p><p>"And for you," she says to Dieter, "I'm almost finished with the sword end."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The totem will take a couple more days."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If you'd like, leave your staff and I can finish it and affix it in a couple more hours?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Aye, that would be ideal. Thank you.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Time of day check)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(After midday.  Maybe 2-3ish?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Begging your pardon, but could we leave this cart in your possession? It is a bit much for us to push around in our haste. You would be welcome to use some of the silver to indulge your professional creativity should you be so inclined.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She slowly nods, "Sure, and thank you for the trust.  I'll put this in the back room for safety."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group load out the rune coins and pack enough silver to be wise for the road. About 25 nuggets each.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We will return in a few hours as requested. How late will you be here?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles, "I'll be here when you get back."  She twirls her hammer and starts back to working on your sword attachment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With a nod, they move off down the road. Dieter, in a hushed voice, suggests that they head back to Trix. He tells them he would like to have her scry again using these strange parchments and coins as a focus.</i></p>

<p>Selection timed out or was cancelled.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s face begins to elongate strangely and his body begins to bend at the midriff, his proportions oddly shifting as his clothing and gear merge into his shifting skin. A moment later where he had stood, there is now a large black stallion. Who neighs and beckons Douglas and Maouelue towards his back in an apparent bid to get them to mount.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas takes a step back, eyes wide, stammering.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I knew you had magic, but..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Heh, he does like a show of his magic now and then, doesn’t he...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye."  He'll go to pat Dieter Stallion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Have you never seen a Druid transformation before? It is truly one of the sights to behold in this world.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Never."  Standing in awe, he thinks for a moment, then says, "Are we really going back to the forest right now?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “It is indeed a bit of a surprise to me, but we have some time before we return to Saynea and then take our meeting with the council. Would you offer an alternative?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter Stallion lets out a snort and kicks his hind hooves at the dirt.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Douglas looks from the horse to the wizard, then back again.  "No, yeah.  Yeah, that's okay.  We can go, that's...  Yeah, that's okay.  Let's go!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gives him what he thinks is an understanding look.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Heh, I remember my first Druid ride...You’re in for a treat.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both hop on, Douglas a bit gingerly and requiring a hand up, then Dieter Stallion accelerates to a canter and heads out of town towards the forest.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you head out of town, farmers wave and double take at the stallion.  You pass the animals in the field again.  There are even a few farm-hands out this time.  As you get closer to the forest route, Dieter, having been through the trail before, picks up the track fairly easily.  There are a couple twists, but he remembers to look for the blood on the trees, and the arrows pointing the way.   A short time later, the group comes into view of the ramshackle homestead of Bellatrix.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just as Douglas hops down from the druid, and arrow flies by his head, narrowly missing piercing his skull.  It embeds itself in the tree just beyond him, and a rapid series of sticks breaking can be heard from where you all just passed by.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to end it on a cliffhanger tonight.  I promise I'll get to more fighting as we go on!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sounds good! I’ve been dilly dallying around town making grandiose proclamations hahaha 🙂 Looking forward to this next phase!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Thanks for the storytelling!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(My pleasure, sir!  Great work as well, this is taking some fun turns.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Maouelue: “I...I...don’t know. I think we should get out of the open and move these prone bodies into the hut.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix comes over to you both.  You can see she's come through an opening in the side of the thicket-wall.  </p><p>"If you're done with the body, I would like to move whomever it is into the circle of..."  She looks down at the body, gasps, and puts her hands over her mouth.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “What is it Bellatrix?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"This...  This is Veena Muhlen.  She's one of the Five.  She owns the general store with her sister, Hozieh."  She looks shocked, horrified.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “For the love of...why?...why would she try to assassinate one of our number? We were supposed to meet with them this very night! Is there aught we can do to help her? Is she truly....dead?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Medicine check?)</p>

<p>After a check, Maouelue bends deeply to her head, checking to see if there is any sign of life.  Amazingly, the wizard senses shallow, wheezing breathing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter is watching this scene anxiously. He considers for a moment then reaches for the half potion in his bag. He unstoppers it and begins pouring the liquid into Veena’s mouth one drop at a time.</i></p><p>“If she wakes...don’t let her move. Trix...what of our man Douglas?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Douglas is no longer a part of this world.  He has passed on.  I did all I could for him."  She looks back to the grove momentarily, then back to the scene at hand.  "He will be interred here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Damn my *haste*! Damn this foul treachery! What is the meaning of all this!?!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman on the ground stirs fractionally.  Barely breathing, the blood at least is staunched and color comes back to her face.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash serpentine for a moment.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter administers another drop of potion and watches carefully for signs of consciousness.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Pwnnnnnd)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The vines come out very quickly, surprising the woman on the ground and securing her completely.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A beat later, she starts laughing hoarsely.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Tell me...Veena, what business does one of the council of five have as an assassin? What grudge do you have with me...and my man who you have so *cravenly murdered*?

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You say craven, I say... business.  This is nothing from the Council.  We're very much looking to speak with you both later."  Her eyes are still closed, but she is smiling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Business? Oh really...And what of your *business* with me? What was it now? *Wizard.  Witch.  My fight is not with either of you.  If you tell me where the druid is, so I may kill him as well, then I'll be on my way.*”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Check your pocket before you spit your venom, or repeat my words back to me."  Eyes still shut, still smiling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, without letting his eyes leave Veena, pulls out the ink splotched parchment from his pocket.</i></p><p>“You mean this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She opens an eye.  Then both.  Smiles back at you, then winks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Have something in your eye? Just <i>what</i> about this carnage and evil is quite so funny to you?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The fact that you think you can get information from me.  The fact that, even though you're holding that, you have no idea what it means.  The fact that I got caught by amateurs and you didn't kill me outright.  There's <i>plenty</i> to find humorous."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh the latter can be arranged wench...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls out his scimitar and holds it to her throat.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix cries out, "No, you musn't!  There are horrible consequences if she loses her life by either of you now."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She hestiates.  "I might have an alternate option."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Oh I’m *all* ears...we came to this town and offered our good will and services, but have been met with naught but deceit and death...Please, illuminate us.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “My companion speaks true. Though he be a bit...bipolar...he is an honest Druid seeking fair justice.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "The best would be for the Five to see what she did, have all three of us vouch for the situation, and give her justice to them.  I can bind her in a Forcecage, she will not be able to escape.  I can watch over her while you both go back and bring the Council here.  We can explain everything to them."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “...and what oath can you take that will prove your honesty in this matter?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Yes, your offer seems to be just but...treachery appears to lie around every corner in these lands. The past two days have not instilled us with confidence...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks shocked at the accusation.  Then visibly composes herself, although with an effort.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'm used to having people distrust me. I understand.  What oath could I give you that you could trust?  I've already helped you with potions.  I could swear something in magic, if you would like?  If either of you are able to do something to that effect?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Aye...you have shown aid to our cause...forgive us. Seeing our companion fall by the hand of this...wretch...the shock is fresh. You seem to be an agent of life rather than death. We will trust you. I will pray that it is not to our doom.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “We came hence to ask you to scry once more...upon these artifacts.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He hands her the parchment and a runed coin.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue regards the scent with intense apprehension and caution, searching for any tell of deceit.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix takes the items, looking forlornly at Dieter.  "I will help you in this.  We need to finish with Veena, first.  After we decide on what to do with her, we can make time for another scry.  I will only be able to do one more today.  May I ask, are these yours or no?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception from Maouelue.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(God this is so much fun! Cate and I are watching The Two Towers so I’m in full fantasy mode hahah )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Faintly, in Maouelue's mind, he hears, <i>"There is much to magic.  Life and death are inexorably linked.  I appreciate them both equally."</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Glad you're digging it, sir!!  Great movie.  Have you seen the Hobbit Peter Jackson movies?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue involuntarily mutters under his breath, “Yes...balance in all things...equal measure...a perfect node of truth in between...”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah! We just went through the hobbit movies again before lotr)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Even though they wrangles three movies out of it, I still liked it.  The best fight scene I've ever seen - save maybe the Minas Tirath battle - is the barrel escape.  With Legolas jumping everywhere are shooting everything in sight.  Amazing!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Perform the binding. But first, let us double our check and leave this...assassin...with no more tricks in her sleeves.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter proceeds to search her for any boot daggers or hidden vials and the like.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No boot daggers (that would have been cool, though!  C'mon Joe, write a better villain...), the bandolier is off of her, along with all of her equipment.  Didn't get her leather armor off, though.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "Your spell will quit when mine starts, you should feel it.  My cage will only last an hour, though, so retrieving the Council will have to be quick.  I will not be able to cast it again."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter scowls.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bind her while we regain our strength. I will take her to the council myself. I would have you come with us...so willing.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh... I...  can.  If you prefer."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes. I will risk no more surprise. Maouelue, come, let us recover an hour and consider what we have seen.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Bellatrix...do you require anything more of us before we retire?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I will pack some things.  However, I do travel light.  Let me step inside.  We require Douglas to remain... uninterred, correct?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “For now...believe me, I would not were there *time*”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"He will be sealed inside the thorn wall, but the carrion birds...  They will have access.  If we hurry, it should be fine.  I will make haste."   She picks up her skirts and runs to her home.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “So be it...”

<p>Bellatrix returns with a small pack, using a staff to guide her steps.  The staff is gnarled, twisted, the top is a mess of brambles, nettles, and thorns curving in on itself to form an imperfect spheroid.  "All set.  I've set wards on my home.  Give me a moment to do the same for Douglas's resting place, and I will create the Forcecage for Veena.  Then we will away."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She waves her hands toward the wall of thorns, a shimmering like a heat haze settles on the structure.  Next she turns to Veena.  Her irises turn a milky white, she points her fingers at the woman.  A darkly wavering set of ethereal walls appear around the prone woman, her vine bonds drop away.  She stands and puts out a tentative hand to the dark magic wall.  She recoils as if bitten and looks darkly at the other woman.</p>

<p>The party makes haste through the forest and into Oakhurst.  Bellatrix says, "Although I know the way to certain people in the Five, I would be... unwelcome calling upon them.  Do you know who you would like to speak with first?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “If there is time, I need to pick up my staff from the forge, then...do you know who the head of the council is?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Yes...come to think of it, we do not now the names of any bar...this fiend.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He scowls at Veena.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Did you take Veena with the group, or is she back at Trix's?)</p><p>"Yes, and no.  There is no head of the Five, they're all equally powerful, within the town as well as in the group.  There is Bazad Dunnol, the tanner.  Rhahlad Boste, he owns the coster.  Vam Stuniz is a wonderful horse trainer, he also works with a variety of farm animals, he's fairly popular with the citizenry.  Then there's Hozieh and Veena."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I did if that’s possible in her stasis.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter doesn’t trust any of these people and he didn’t want to take any chances.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think the original idea was that she would be in the spell cage for the short rest and they would bind her for the way back.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do you have a map of this at all?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The map of the town is pinned - the upper right hand corner.  I could specify what they are.  How would the party be transporting Veena?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was thinking after the short rest Dieter would turn back into a horse and they would bind her to his back.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Had a question about the level up during short rest as well. They both learned new spells,  it I think I accidentally switched the prepared spells and I may not be allowed in a short rest. What’s your call on that?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That'll be fine.  Since we're doing xp leveling you should be able to add the spells and such whenever you hit the level.  You'll need to long rest for the hp and the spell slots to be available.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(perf)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gonna check the map real quick and make a route plan here)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We'll go to Maester Stuniz. I'll trust meself a horsemaster ere a tanner any day. Do you think the two of you can get her there while I meet with Saynea and rejoin quickly thereafter?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes, I can take you there."  (If you'd rather not rp the blacksmith trip, we can just say you went there & picked up the bit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(To give you an idea of what I was thinking for these two custom weapons, I wanted each of the characters to pour their meditations into them over time with each rest, focusing on infusing them with their own magical essence as they grow. I want the bladestaff to synergize with the Shelleliegh and that it might have a slash attack and a bludgeon attack. The orbs, Maouelue would focus a different magical bias into each of them over time and practice balancing them in his left hand as an offhand/source item. The silver was with a nod to making them anti undead or armor or whatever is canon in this world.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(also let me know if i'm a crazy person!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group is anxious as they approach the ranch, looking around and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of all the animals.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter seems as calm as he has in a while in the midst of the beast party.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue looks as if he is bracing for a snowstorm.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a crazy person!  How would you like the meditations to work?  As a combat boon or hp aid, something else?  The blade can give the quarterstaff an extra 1d6 slashing, you'll have to roll that separately.  I was thinking with or without the Shillelagh, but it's up to you on that.  The three silver orbs - that'll be cool!  The silver is... an interesting situation.  I've already thrown out the idea of were-animals only being affected by silver weapons.  Or else your fight in the Mountain's Toe Gold Mine would have gone...  very poorly!  I'd like to maybe add a die roll if the creature you're attacking is undead, maybe an extra 1d6?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That all sounds totally on point. I'm messing around with the avrae aliasing stuff and i also saw you can get a bunch of extra commands from the serveralias pages etc. At some point i'll try to make a shortcut for some of it, but LMK what numbers you think are fair and I'll try to use that info.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(re: Shillelagh, that spell was kind of core to why i wanted to make the weapon, so whatever doesn't seem OP that can use that would be great.)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The meditations would just be like over time we maybe discover new techniques or empower some aspect of it with enough focused training.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool cool!  Shillelagh is one of my favorite spells.  I dig that aspect of the meditation, too.  Let me know what you're thinking and we'll check it out.  Before we get started on this next part, I gotta get some sleep!  It's been a long weekend, WAY too much yardwork!!  I'll start up the rp and - hopefully - encounters first thing tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yay! Thanks man! I may tinker with the bot a bit more in here. Looking forward to the morn!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I'm so bad with this recently, I'm sorry!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I hear you're starting in on the Ravenloft today, too, eh?!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The quartet walk down the street,  the woman in the cage draws almost all of the attention.  Whispers flit back and forth between shop patrons and the rabble that roam through town.  There aren't a lot of people, but you feel that it probably doesn't matter, this is going to be the hot gossip today.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>After a quick stop by the blacksmith's shop to procure Dieter's staff attachment (which is a beautiful counterpoint to the sliver death accompanying the opposite side of the staff now), the group heads Southeast, to a substantial group of farmland.  Rows of crops sway in the autumnal breeze as farm hands work with various animals.  An interesting addition, A group of rothe' roam the pasture past the waving grain.   These buffalo-type creatures typically come from the north, and it takes a practiced hand to raise them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group plods deeper into the farm, you see a very dark-skinned man, wide brimmed hat in his hands, talking to a rothe', soothingly.  The man has curly white hair, balding a bit on the top.  Smile lines crease his face, and it's no surprise, he's grinning while talking to the large creature next to him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He turns to notice the four people traveling towards him, smiles wider, and makes his way to you after patting the beast on it's rump.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I was wondering when I would have a chance to run into you folks," he says, winning smile possibly going even wider.  "Heard a lot about what you've done for the town already, and what you're planning on doing. Might fine, migh-ty fine.  This little place's been waiting for men like you, been saying it for years, isn't that right Bellatrix?  It's right nice to see you as well, ma'am."  And he gives a little bow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dang didn't even see this until now, but look at this fanciness...)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Always glad to meet the acquaintance of one so skilled with animals. I've got a special relationship with beasts myself. Master Stuniz, I presume?"

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(NICE!!  Well done, sir!  Did that take a lot of coding, or were you able to get a script?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I've been coding that for a while now. Lots of hurdles to get over, but I think I'm getting a hang of it now.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Please, please, call me Vam.  No one calls me anything but, I won't let 'em!"  He laughs heartily.  "Now, what can I do for the Heroes of Oakhurst, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The tricky bit was being able to add the name argument so I could have Mao use Dieter's spellcasting modifier like the cantrip specifies.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow, yeah, just noticed that...  Extremely impressive!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Vam, I'm afraid we bring fel tidings. Veena here before you beset us by ambush just outside faithful Bellatrix's door. We went in search of information about the dark deeds plaguing the town. I shudder even now to think what has befallen poor Culver. Veena saw fit to assassinate our companion Douglas, then attempt to flee. We were most surprised to find a member of the five under the hood when we laid her low...We would serve this town in honesty and good will, but this was a shock unexpected."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His smile falters, fades.  </p><p>"Wait, what did you say?"</p><p>He tries to see past you to the cage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seeing Veena, he's shocked.  He looks between the four of you, trying to understand what he's seeing.</p><p>"I don't understand.  She killed someone?  When did this happen?  How?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Do you tell Vam everything, or do you hold some thing(s) back?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party informs Vam of the events in the forest, withholding that they carry her possessions for now.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They also conveniently leave out the part about nearly setting the forest ablaze.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks sternly at the group.  "Well, I have to admit...  Not too sure what to make of all this.  I have quite a bit of history, professionally, with this woman, as most of the town does.  This sounds just like one of them fairy tales, I just can't believe Veena could be capable...  Have you told anyone else?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye, we are taken aback as well and equally unsure. We've not told anyone perse, but there were some onlookers as we came into town, though whether she was recognized I cannot say. My companion and I lack the ability to pierce any illusion at play here. Thus we seek council from the rest of the...ahem...Council..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue fidgets idly with his triumvirate of sliver orbs while the converse.</i></p><p><i>Dieter idly thumbs the contours of his newly-crafted eagle totem.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A-yuh, that sounds about right, we need to convene immediately."  He dons his hat.  "Lemme check on some things at the house, I'll put a word out to everyone to meet.  There is a building we use as the Council meeting area, but I'm afraid it's not available at the moment.  We'll just have to have them come here, does that work for y'all?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group nods in assent. Everyone is nervous, but this seems an amicable accord thus far. Eyes remain open, but guard is lowered ever slightly.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, one more thing," he says, tightening his gaze on the Maouelue, Dieter, and Bellatrix.  "This Douglas.  You, uh...  You still have the body?  Because if you do, I'd say we might want to bring him here, post-haste."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue glances at Bellatrix.</i></p><p>"We...had not time to intern it, but we have tried to secure it best we could. It's back at Trix's. Might should we head there together once the council is joined?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell you what," he turns and whistles at a nearby farm hand on a horse.  "One of you can go with Heston here and retrieve the body.  We might start without you, but no one is going to do anything without seeing Douglas's body."  With that, he makes a clicking sound with his cheek, nods to you all, and runs into the farmhouse at  good pace.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter obliges and makes great haste as he reassures Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Right. Let's get the council."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you enter the farmhouse, there are a couple older boys receiving orders from Vam.  </p><p>"Go round them up and bring them back here, double time.  Git going."</p><p>The boys dash out the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's fiddling becomes more intense as they wait. Creeping cryogenic crystals begin to form on the orbs' surfaces, stretching out from frosty fingertips.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
@SuoRess_1019  :game_die:
**Result**: 1d20 (3) + 2
**Total:** 5

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam doesn't see.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gazes around the farmhouse, taking in his surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A handful of minutes pass.  A knock comes at the door and an older man with broad shoulders and a bald head peeks in.  His hands are large, gnarly, he's still wearing a smock of slick leather.  His face is lined, worn.  He looks extremely worried and says, "Vam, what's all this about needing to meet right away?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sizes the man up with a glance.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sees a very nicely kept homestead.  Plain wood beams and walls cover the interior, sawdust is on the floor.  Everything looks worn but very naturally so.  There are saddles hung over a bannister that leads to a cellar, it seems.  There is a second floor as well.  The main floor of the house is one big room, encompassing kitchen, sitting room, dining area, and foyer all in one.  There is a small hallway off to the right of the wizard, which ends with a couple doors, one on either side of the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks capable of handling himself in a fight, he's burly, strong.  He exudes an air of timidity, though.  Other than that, Maouelue doesn't get a real solid vibe about him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Greetings good sir. Maouelue is my name. It is well that you could come on such notice. You have my thanks."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks tentatively from Vam to you, very timid, very nearly backs out of the doorway.  Vam waves the big man in, and he stops his retreat.  He says, "Mm...  My name is Bazad.  I'm here for the Council meeting."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Well met."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods, shakes your hand rather quickly, then goes over to speak with Vam.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue casts a glance at Bellatrix and takes note of the increasing awkwardness of Veena's caged form.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He moves semi-casually to obscure it from immediate view.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check about Veena.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another knock on the door.  A portly, middle-aged man comes in while he's knocking.  He wears a sense of importance like a cloak.  You get the sense he might have been muscular at one time, but he's let that go for quite a while.  </p><p></p><p>He strides in, making eye contact with Vam and Bazad, then says loudly, "Who in the hell called this meeting.  I know Vam couldn't have been this idiotic, so who's responsible for taking me away from my business?  And at closing time, nonetheless?"  His eyes fall on the wizard and the witch.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “In a way you might say one of *you* called this meeting.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A realization hits Maouelue as a mental flash...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Veena has not moved or blinked since she's been caged.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What the hell does that mean?!"  He looks around from person to person, arms flailing in the air.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Forgive my being cryptic. Our company, such as it is, was attacked by one of your number, here. A man has been slain by her hand."
*He gestures at Veena, realizing he can't dodge the issue much longer, and seeking to get out in front of it.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Fear not her cage. She has been placed in stasis in order that we might secure her from flight."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"And I beg your pardon sir, I go by the name of Maouelue. My partner Dieter has gone with some of Vam's hands to retrieve...our friend's body."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What?..."  The portly man stares incredulously at you.  He and Bazad come over to the cage, with Vam behind.  They are awestruck at their unblinking friend behind bars of energy.</p><p>"I don't understand, what in the hell is going on here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam explains to the group what the three heroes told to him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He ends and a small voice comes through the doorway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That's a lie.  My sister would do no such thing."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue turns, startled.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And through the doorway steps a matronly looking woman.  Her clothes give off an air of being of money, old money, but maybe not much is left anymore.  She saunters in, glides.  If you though the other man had an air of importance, it's nothing compared to Hozieh Muhlen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "If what you say is true, then this must not be your sister..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He gestures grandly at Veena-in-cage.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Red satin, deep crimson velvet, and black lace adorn the petite body, and make a strange non-cohesion to her heavily made-up face.  As if they're fighting each other for relevance, the two styles are at war with your senses.  She comes across as old but trying to be young, but also young trying to pass as courtly and on-in-years.  It is a very odd feeling, and for those not used to her presence, Hozieh Muhlen makes people feel... strange.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She very stately strides over to the cage, aware that all eyes are on her.  As she approaches the Forcecage, she holds her hand out.  Bellatrix starts to warn her, Hozieh's eyes dart to the witch and Bellatrix goes still, silent.  All watch as the sisters reach for each other.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thunder crashes in the distance, and a streak of white hot light flashes, searing everyone's eyes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue blinks rapidly bidding his vision to return as quickly as possible. He searches about with the butt of his staff trying to reestablish his surroundings.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two women...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(This is some amazing coding!  Nicely done.  I wonder if it can still target when in initiative order?  We can try, if you'd like; sim an encounter?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The power went out another three times last night.  The last one was for four hours.  Not my night, I was super bummed to have to cut it like that.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah dude. I haven’t figured out targeting yet, but would love to put it together. Honestly it may end up being easier to build it in Beyond and just update. Does the shillelaghs enchant +slashing seem OP?</p><p></p><p>A bit of a bummer, but also a fun cliffhanger.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(A bit, but that just means I throw harder things at you!  The assassin was a higher level, you seemed to do just fine with that 😀)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Seems to be the biggest problem with the homebrew content, no one site deals with it well.  Beyond is very much pay-to-play, and they don't allow outside sources.  Discord seems fine, as long as you have some coding background, but the more particular things might be tough.  Roll20 is cool, a bit more user friendly as point-and-click goes.  But even with them, you have to shell out for the pre-set options.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Gotcha. I was thinking maybe the slashing attack doesn’t get the spell modifier added? It could also maybe be a d4 damaged roll etc. until I skill myself up with it.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Another thought was that it could require a bonus action to apply the phantom hit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That's not bad, either.  Might be tougher to write into the script, but it could be a separate attack altogether.  How about this - just like with a one-handed versus two-handed versus a thrown weapon, it would depend on how you're attacking.  If you want to use the blade to slash, you go with that attack.  The bludgeoning could be a wholly separate series of attacks, and maybe if you wanted to do a double attack, your meditation from the previous day could allow for that?  Get a meditation point system going, or something of the like?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That is sounding pretty cool. The idea of meditating charges/slots for special attack seems like a nice balance and could potentially work with the orbs too. There could also be some skill element where if he uses the double attack he has a chance to cut himself for 1d4 with the blade end haha)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That's for when you roll a 1!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And the two women...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Are no longer there.</p><p>Everyone looks around in astonishment.  No one more so than Bellatrix, who is still holding the Forcecage solid.  There are no rips or tears, she is frantically searching for what went wrong.</p><p>Just then, a horse neighs out front, Heston and Dieter enter the house carrying the wrapped body of Douglas.</p><p>Heston asks Vam, "Pardon, boss.  Where do you want us to put this?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(all my testing has led me to completely miss this actual progression lolol)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Dieter...what timing...the Muhlen sisters have just disappeared!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He fills Dieter in on what he missed, then turns to address the crowd.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What does the council make of this sorcery?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They are dumbfounded, looking on the cage with astonishment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Bellatrix, what fearsome magicks might have the power to perform such an act?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix is still moving frantically over the cage, trying to find out what went wrong.  She starts emitting a low whining moan, which picks up the more frantic she gets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nothing!" she screams.  "Nothing can break free from a Forcecage!  That is one of my most powerful spells..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rest of the Five go to inspect the body.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers into the eyes of each of the remaining council members imploring them to speak up should they have any knowledge of the sisters' intentions.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They are uncomfortable, Bazad looks as if he'd like to find a reason to leave.  They start inspecting the body of Douglas.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't really tell if they're hiding anything or not.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Friends...councilmen, will you aid us in the pursuit of these treacherous creatures? If not, how long before it is your shop that is ransacked, or your heart poisoned with a fetid arrow?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He pulls out the bandolier of poison vials and gestures to Douglas' corpse.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How many more honest townsfolk need to die to serve the ends of this pestilent sorcery!?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Will you join us in our aim to consolidate the strength of this town? Will you assent to a guild of vigilant watchers? Would you see this evil undone!?!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look abashed, Bazad hangs his head.  Vam stands, saying, "A lot of things just happened right now.  I don't doubt that you have the best interests at heart, and we truly appreciate what you've done here."  He takes a deep breath.  "It seems to me that there is some treachery that has been happening right under our noses."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The portly man starts to object, but Vam speaks up, "Now, listen Rhal, you know as well as I do there have been some strange happenings for a good time now.  Matter of fact, the <i>supposed</i> culprit is standing right here in this room.  I'm not saying all of the facts are on the table, but there's enough for me to say this whole town, and <i>especially</i> the Council, needs to make a formal apology to Ms. Bellatrix here."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix's body sags as she releases her Forcecage.  She looks tired, haggard even.  She also looks extremely scared.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two heroes nod in approval of this sentiment, having been aided by Bellatrix without question several times now.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "My company must take rest soon, and I suggest we move elsewhere ere nightfall. Is there somewhere safe we would sup and discuss before taking our bed for the night?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You can feel free to rest and eat here.  Don't have much, or anything fancy, but there's plenty of beans and bread, at least tonight.  And there's a room at the end of the hall with space for some bedrolls.  What else for food...  there's the inn, and, of course, The Pig and Falcon.  I have to take care of this body, fellas.  We'll make sure he has a proper burial after we've gone over it for evidence.  Bellatrix, could you assist us, please dear?"</p><p>Vam goes over to check on the witch, and gently leads her over to Douglas.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue and Dieter come over and watch make a strange F-shaped gesture to pay their last respects to Douglas.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The men comb over the body, checking the wounds and the poison stains around his mouth.  They get a very detailed description of the fight with the assassin from Bellatrix.  Ultimately, move the body into the yard and Bellatrix goes about preparing Douglas for burial.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad approaches the two adventurers.  "You gentlemen decided where to sup, yet?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let us take our meal here and rest. There is much to discuss.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"True, there is much to discuss."  He leads you both to the dining area, where a sturdy table with six seats are stands empty.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter and Maouelue sit down</i></p><p>“We would hear the wisdom of the council. Ere we lay our course. What make you all of this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad makes a showing of offering you seats, then sits after you, playing a gracious host.</p><p>"Well, to be sure, today was one hell of a day.  I'm still not sure I'm not dreaming or not!"  He guffaws, looking around at the others.  Seeing no one is in a jovial mood, his demeanor darkens a bit.  </p><p>He then says, "Listen, there's bad business done here today.  To you, to the townfolks of Oakhurst.  To that young woman out there tending to your friend.  That happened some time ago, actually."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It all starts with missing children in the town.  A whole mess of them went missing, and we just couldn't find out what was happening to them.  When we sent out for help to other towns around the area, they reported the same thing happening.  Obviously, the Council got to work speaking with everyone, sometimes seven or eight times.  I feel we did our due diligence.  And, no matter who we talked to, the finger always pointed at Trix, there."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"She was always the black sheep of the community.  Everyone knew she practices magic.  At one time, our little town was very anti magic.  There was an impassioned plea from Trix's family, and we started turning our minds around, slowly to be sure.  Then someone showed us the black art that she deals in, and, well, one thing lead to another.  She was run out of town.  I do believe this is the first time she's set foot in Oakhurst in several years."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Looking back on it, there probably were signs of what the Muhlen's had up their sleeves.  They were very secretive with each other, to be sure.  How in the hell were we supposed to know they were evil, though?  They've been pillars of the community.  The general store they run is beyond remonstration; they are fantastic business people and generous members of the Council."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam speaks up, "What about the vote on these boys' idea, huh?  We should have pressed them more, there.  Should have known something was foul.  Wasn't the first time on that, neither."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam spits out the door, into the dusty walkway.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “The dread hands of the devil are oft dressed in decorum...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Justice lies just beyond the ice...it’s an old frost mage thing he taught me.”
*Dieter elbows Maouelue gently.*
Maouelue: “Indeed...”
Dieter: “We must gain reconnaissance of this town and its surroundings. Let it be known we will not tolerate the treachery of the Muhlen sisters in this town of Oakhurst nor those complicit. Maouelue and I have suspicion that there might be secrets hiding in the greater Kratos Hill Mine, but lack for a more general intelligence of the area. Please, be our guide in this manner.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let the juicy ice of justice flow into the heart of the mountain!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Rhahlad: "Kratos Hill, eh?  No idea about that.  All I've ever heard about that place is that it was used by a band of smuggler a long time ago.   A few of the younger men tried their hands at the silver ore trade for a while, but nothing too great came from it.  Might have gone to bigger towns, if they had found anything, come to think of it.  What about you, Bazad.  Anything to add?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bazad shakes his head, still looking uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Vam: "A-yuh, I can second that.  Lots of ghost stories about miners coming back from the dead and smugglers attacking anyone looking for their hidden treasure."  He laughs.  "Mostly told to keep the kids around here from doin' anything stupid.  Do you think Kratos Hill and the Muhlan sisters have something in common?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “It’s these coins...these runes...they keep appearing at all of these incidents. Culver, Douglas, the mine...and something Veena said about this...”
*He lays down the ink splotched parchment along with a few of the runic coins.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look down at the parchment.</p><p>Rhahlad starts guffawing.</p><p>Bazad looks like he's going to be sick.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam scratches his head.  "Am...  Am I missing something.  What is that?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad says, "It's some childish prank!  Who gave that to you, seriously?!  That's the best joke I've ever seen, ha.  You boys are all right...  Ah.  I needed that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The party looks at the two men’s reactions with interest.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Is it a prank that one of these burst into flames in my pocket? Is it a prank that a man I had detained disappeared leaving only one of these behind in his stead?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “If any of you know more of these runes I would have you speak of it. Now.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A pale blue comes over the wizard’s eyes as he says this.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad stops laughing immediately.  "Whoa, whoa, I meant no offense, gentlemen, honestly I didn't.  I've no idea what you'd been through, don't blame me if i thought you were putting us on with this."  He taps the paper.</p><p>Looking back and forth between the four others, he says, "You all seriously don't know what this is?  The 'black spot'?  You've never heard the old sailor's tales of the 'black spot'?</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I suppose it’s high tide we did...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bazad and Vam look on in confusion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I come from the coast, but traverse the seas by...different means.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  that's fair.  Story's simple really, there're tales about pirates receiving this same mark, parchment with a ink spot on it, when they're marked for death.  I thought it was a mere child's story..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “...sadly...that tracks with our experience...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam shakes his head, studies the parchment again.  </p><p>"Can you point out the runes, here?  I don't see anything like that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s fingers glow white as he twirls his triumvirate with increasing vigor.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “The coins...look at the coins. We also...have seen this circle in dreams.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rhahlad and Vam pick up a coin each, studying them intently.</p><p>(Perception check for either on Bazad.)</p>

<p>The big man is now sitting on a padded bench, away from the group, close to the window at the front of the house.  He's chewing his nails and his knees are bouncing rapidly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let us hear from the quiet one.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter turns imploringly toward the large uncomfortable man.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bazad starts whining, pitching higher and higher.  He holds his hands on his ears on both sides of his head.  He rocks back and forth, slowly at first...  then he picks up pace.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes a nearby glass of water and levitates the contents over toward Bazad. He shapes it slowly into each rune in the circle in front of the man's face trying to force him out of his shocked reticence.</i></p>

<p>Vam hustles down the rope ladder and offers assistance.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue beckons him to tend to Dieter, then moves over to examine the snake more closely, looking at its fangs and markings.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes Vam's hand and gestures toward the rope, then begins to stand up and head that way.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he begins up the ladder, he thinks of the snake and sees something gleaming in his bag. The mirror...Frenchy...He'd have to keep that in mind going forward. This was another near-fatal encounter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue checks over the body of the snake.  It's pretty hideous.  He's a constrictor snake, about 12 feet long.  Good meat for the taking, the hide is very valuable if tanned and treated correctly.  It wasn't poisonous, and even though it could speak and had smallish appendages that could have been called arms, it did not use weapons.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue picks up his orbs and wipes them off on his robe. He tries to being hauling the snake back toward the opening and calls to Vam for assistance.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Help me drag and hoist this beast back up topside. Though sadly I don't think Bazad will be helping us cure this hide...Another loss..."

<p>The two heroes, a bit shaken by their previous run in, have a bit of a restless time getting to sleep.  The majority of the night is peaceful.  There comes a time, right when the moon is just past the midpoint of its apex, when both men have the same dream...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>The darkness opens onto an entrance.  Runes are etched, but these are not the ones you're searching for.  There are many hazards here, many ways to die.  You enter and pass rooms, pass through hallways untouched by human eyes for generations.  You come upon a large hall, filled with statues holding up the ceiling.  These enormous statues depict lizardfolk in battle.  Victorious over their foes.  A strange feeling comes over you as you turn to see more lizardfolk around you, but these are not statues.  These are snake-people...  Snakes with humanoid features.  Arms on some, legs on others.  All with scales or some semblance of leathery hide.  They take you and tie you to the dias at the end of the big hall.  They pierce your side, let the blood run down the dias into a pool.  Whispery footsteps can be heard, a path is made by the crowd to let</i> him <i>in.  You catch a blurred glimpse of the smiling face as you succumb to your injuries.</i></p>

<p>(So after all that aliasing I just decided to create the heirloom item stuff on dndbeyond and sync it. Take a look at the attacks/descriptions when you have a second. I think I’ve made it pretty balanced, but let me know what you think and we can chat about progression.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They look AWESOME!  The only weird thing is the fail damage - there is no indication of a pass, or is there no hit on a pass?  Can we strike the Con save in lieu of a true hit?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Should the hit be tied to the normal attack and the slowed status be on the save or something like that? I was just tinkering with the save throw. Feel free to edit)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Took the con save off frosty ball. What do you think about the Cyclone Slash? Dex save mech ok? Damage and long rest reset seem fair?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(My thought for the bladestaff attacks is that it’s a versatile weapon and the bludgeoning attacks will benefit from shillelagh, while the blade attacks are finesse, so they will use my dex instead.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cyclone slash same as the frosty ball, however we can keep the Con save and say that it throws whomever it hits if they fail the save.  You can decide how far they're thrown, we'll set that as a separate roll.  Good thought on the bladestaff, that is exactly what I was envisioning as well!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two magic users waken at first light, their eyes feeling somewhat heavier than usual. They each rise, stretch, and take care of their morning usuals. They each then take their newly crafted heirlooms outside into the morning light and dew for a spot of meditation and exercise. As they pose and twirl about in the sunbeams, the silver of their weapons twinkles and bends the light into waving spectra cascading over the ranch. Dieter imagines a cyclone from his past and spins around in sweeping arcs, while Maouelue plays at sending ice crystals around his orbs and watches the angled refractions dance. He casually lobs one over at the spinning Dieter, who spots it mid turn and strikes it with the eagle end of his bladestaff. The orb soars out into the field amongst the animals. The two catch each other’s eyes and smile. They needed this moment after the haranguing pressures of the previous days. The stop their exercises and climb over the corral fencing to go and retrieve the ball, taking note of the animals along the way.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
*Dieter reaches down and picks up the orb he struck, handing it back to Maouelue.*

Dieter: “These look a bit blue in the morning light friend!”

Maouelue: “Yes... I *long* for the comforts of home...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are few in the field, and only sparse farm hands out.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both spy smoke coming from near the house.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “You must needs be careful with that blade around your staff...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I can be a bit hard headed at times...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two men cut short their heats and quickly pivot to inspect the source of the smoke.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam and Heston have started a cookfire outside.  They've set out massive strips of white-grey meat, set to throw them on the fire as it builds.</p><p>"Mornin' friends!  How about some fresh snake meat to break your fast, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Ah yes! We were just discussing snake meat! Pass me a footlong!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Vengence is...delicious.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam chuckles and says, "Now, gimme second to sear the damned thing!  Unless you take yours rarified!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston chuckles too, concentrating on honing his knife but listening to the happenings of the farm in the morning.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The meat is cooked to perfection, and stories are told around the breakfast camp fire.  (Anything you want to ask Vam or Heston?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Many thanks for the feast! The spoils of victory can be sweet indeed. I'm afraid I must now turn our concerns to the matters at hand. What do you know of Culver and Douglas? Is there anything that might link them to the Muhlen sisters? And what of Bazad?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston sits back in his seat, taking a chew off his plug of tobacco, offers it around.  Vam declines, the takes a deep breath and pushes his plate away.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, good sirs, I don't rightly know where to start.  Don't know if I'm going to enlighten you folks, either.  But I can tell you what happened after you slipped off to dreamland last night."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bunch of us, we stayed up taking care of this here snake.  Bellatrix came through and told us Douglas was ready for burial, so we took care of that in the patch the town's reserved for such things.  Bellatrix ended up taking off after that, but she mentioned that we might want someone to watch over the graveyard that night, just in case.  I put one of my hands on it, he didn't see anything amiss all night.  Not a hide nor hair from Bazad.  Rhahlad did come back, but only for a few seconds.  Heston here scared him right off, just showed him what you gents faced down in the streets last night."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So...  I guess the best way to begin about Douglas and Culver is to say, I really don't <i>know</i> all that much.  Culver was a staple of the town, Douglas just seemed to be a passer-by.  They got to drinking together, guess that was their bond.  There was a miner friend of theirs, too, used to keep the end three stools at the Pig warm, if you know what I'm gettin' at.  Didn't interact with Douglas, but Culver and I go way back.  Get most all of my supplies from him.  Shame to hear he's gone missing."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There was some scuttlebutt about Culver and Douglas dealing with the big man from the Pig, calls hisself Molur.  People say they were looking for something for him, maybe laundering it through Culver's store.  But that's all hearsay, I've never had a bad deal from Culver.  He's a good 'un."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"As far as them having a link to the Muhlen's, that's a no go.  S'far as I know," he sucks his teeth a bit, trying to wean out a bit of loose snake meat, "They don't have any connection at all.  There're all sorts and sizes of stories about the Muhlen's.  They're the royalty of Oakhurst.  Matter of fact, they used to have a mansion house not too far from here.  All decrepit now, not any place anyone could live in.  Their maw and paw used to live up there, along with gallons of children!  So many running all over the damned place!  The father, he had his life tied up into that mine, Krytos Hill.  When the belly went up on it, so did his fortune, and he moved right outta here, taking the whole family with him.  All except Veena and Hozieh.  They had already set up shop here and didn't want to head out."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Years passed, they became a staple of the town.  Some would even say the cornerstone.  We get so many just passing through, to have an established community started to make us think we could make something outta this place."  He takes a long, deep breath.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Shoulda figured it was too good to be true.  Those missing children.  Only happened for a short time, and stopped when Bellatrix went away.  They coulda been planning that for a while.  I bet Bellatrix might even have more to say on the subject, but she's scarred from the experience.  Surprised to even see her in town.  Horrible what we did to her, accused her of.  I'm rambling, but the bottom line is this - we had no idea they were witches or magicians or whatever they are.  We had no idea they were rotting this town from the inside out.  And wherever they are now, well they can just get going straight to hell, because if they ever come back to Oakhurst again...  We're going to have ourselves a mighty fine bonfire that night, I can tell you that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "...all those children...gallons of Muhlen children...two secretive witches...a decrepit mansion...mysterious runes...Who's up for a hunt?!?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam looks up and shakes his head.  "You gentlemen be careful if you go searchin' for trouble.  These women... they're insidious.  If they could be right next to us for so long and us not know anything?  They're capable of anything."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I am keen to discover more about these sisters as well. Perhaps Bellatrix's counsel will be most valuable. We should send word for her and take a closer look at this manse. We still have no clue of Culver's whereabouts."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Vam have you something else about them you would have us know?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam ponders for a moment, trying to think back to anything he can remember that can help you.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bazad.  Bazad was acting real strange, right?  Like he was hiding something.  He was on the Council too, and I just keep recalling that most of the votes, he went along with nearly everything Hozieh said.  Even if it didn't make sense, he was always...  I haven't thought about those kids in the yard for such a long time, but...  I think...  Guys, I think Bazad was their brother."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "If that right then...then...*would they drag their own brother off like that*? He was irreconcilably reticent...yes...this makes sense."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "The tunnels...we could follow the tunnels. Track them down to their lair!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouleue: "There is much to consider. Good Vam, good Heston, I fear we cannot dally to create our guild just now, but what say you stay behind and rally the townsfolk while we scout out the borders of these dark magics?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam shrugs, then nods.  Heston pipes up, gruff voice sounding like gravel being ground, "I can track just 'bout anythin'.  There's no trail on the one that got away.  The tunnels are being repaired by some folks from the town, but I'd say you could follow them, if you can find a way down into one.  Looks like they head south."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam adds, "That's the direction of the old Muhlen place.  You can catch the river south of here and follow it a few miles southeast.  Their place is about two hundred yards from the river, 'bout ten, fifteen miles down as the river flows."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Might be we should stay above ground for now and look for any signs of tunnel entrances on the way southward toward the Manor. I like my chances in an open field more than a labyrinth of tubes."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Some walls can be seen, others only felt, and yet there is a way to all things..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Riiiight...*he does this sometimes*. Grab those frosty balls and let's get out of here. My man Vam, could you spare us a couple of mounts for the road?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouleue looks up at Dieter slightly reproachfully, but obliges.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You bet!"  He whistles over to the farm hands, but Heston pats him on the shoulder.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Heston: "I'll get 'em set up."  And he ushers you both to the barn.  There are a few horses in here, a thick draft horse that looks similar to a Clydesdale.  There is a Criollo, grey/black with thick tufts of mane and tail.  There are two Mustangs, deep brown coats with tan manes.  They're all used for various work on the ranch, Heston explains.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Vam's good with you pickin' what you need.  Oh, and I wanted to ask you guys somethin'..."  He trails off, looking a little sheepish.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Shy not away from what you would ask Heston. We all need to support each other through this."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, it's just...  I could use that snake skin for so many different things.  I was hoping I could use some of it.  Not all, mind ye.  Just wanted to try my hand at a few things.  Some boots, a vest, maybe some leather armor or something padded-like?   I unnerstand if you guys wanted to sell it or something..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter smiles wrily.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking a fine snake jerkin would look might fair this time of year. Some bracers could help with some of this staff practice as well."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "And every wizard...needs a hat!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks at you expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Heston good man. Take the lot and practice your craft. I would love to see the fruits of your artistry. Should we encounter more of these serpents along the way, would you have us bring you more material?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "...a *pointy* hat!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter sizes up the Clydesdale and Maouelue runs his fingers over the ashen beauty of the Criollo.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks giddy, which is an odd look for a cowboy.</p><p>"Ah, thanks so much!  I'll get going on that right away.  Pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers.  Got it!"  He tips his hat and run-shuffles away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The heroes smile after him fondly then lead their chosen steeds out of the paddock, heading back over to Vam to give their thanks.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Vam...how can we ever repay you?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam turns from cleaning the breakfast, putting out the cookfire.   He says, "...  When I was a kid, my pa used to tell me a scary tale of the Baba Yaga.  Ever hear of it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two mages shake their heads and listen intently.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  She's the witch of all witches.  Had scads of children, some famous wizards in their own right.  If you can bring back those two, alive, or something close to it, I want to ask them a question.  If you can't bring them back, ask them this question for me - Is it true that the Yaga still lives?  I'd be forever in your debt if you find the answer to that question, gentlemen."  He nods, solemnly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and be careful of that Criollo.  Her name's Ashpeak.  And she likes to bite."  He smiles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue repeats, "Ashpeak...steady girl..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She calmly looks back at the wizards.  And whinnies.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We will do this for you."

<p>The horses listen to the two adventurers...  for the most part.  A few miles into the trip, you come to a river.  It's about 60 feet across, and the water level looks fairly deep.  It's a dark blue, moving well so the bottom is decently obscured.  That being said, you have already seem some fish darting about, occasionally one jumps out of the water.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Sitting on the bank of the river, about a couple hundred feet away, is a figure.  It looks like they might be fishing.  They're sitting on a small shoal where the edge of the bank meets the water smoothly.  For most of the trip, the river bank has been about two feet above the water level.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The riders being their horses to a gentle canter and approach the figure, waving casually in their direction.</i></p><p>“Ho there!”, shouts Dieter</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both see a halfling man, hairy feet dipped in the water, lying back on the shoal, eyes closed.  As you hail him, he opens his eyes, props himself up on an elbow, and says (in a <i>thick</i> cockney brogue), "Ahoy there lads, ahoy there and how're ye doing this fine day, eh?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "The waters flow kindly along the banks this morning. We are travelers seeking interesting wildlife in these lands. We mean not to disturb your rest kind halfling."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I take it you are familiar with the domain along the riverbank here, friend?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Those are kind words and kind faces, lads!  Well met, well met indeed.  I was just sunning meself by the bank here, taking a load off as they say.  Been traveling far and anon, singing my songs, telling my tales, of that you can be sure.  The domain...  Oh, aye, the old mansion atop the hill, aye, looks like there could be some good stories about that place, aye, indeed.  Sadly, Briffo Lightfoot has no such knowledge of that stormy looking place..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He gets up and moves to his pack. "I do have some items that are needing a good home, though?"  He looks at you two, expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Items, you say? Well I always have a good home for the like. What say you come with us and gather a few stories for your songs and we'll see what accommodations we can make for those."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"...  Uh..."  His almost juvenile smile falters massively.  His skin takes on a green pallor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Um...  Sh...  Sure, lads.  Let us away!  Did you want to see the wares first, or would you like to see a test of the stores, so to speak?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye that's the spirit. Let's take a look at what you have and then be on our way."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks more heartened at this prospect, and opens his bag.</p><p>"Briffo Lightfoot carries many a potion, these are but some of what I have to offer," and he pulls out five bottles.  One is red and swirling, a second is a larger bottle of the same variety liquid.  The next is cloudy green, and there looks to be a jellyfish-like creature swimming in it.  The penultimate is a dark purple brew with green bubbles drifting throughout.  Lastly, there is a strange, small vial.  This one is almost pearlescent, rainbow veins of light swirl through it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Also, I have these," he puts out a cloth with three rings on them.  One is golden, banded with flecks of emerald.  There is a platinum one with a crest of a shield as a figurehead.  There is another gold one, very scratched and pock-marked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They look over the potions and ask after their effects. Maouelue inspects the set of rings closely inquiring about...pricing.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and don't forget these here!"  He takes a roll off of his bag and unravels a few more items, giggling as he does so.  There are a couple small stones he's wrapped tightly together, both with a single matching rune on them.  A long stick of yew wood.  Lastly, there is an oddly glowing rod of a strange material.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Both men look at each other, then the runes on the stones, casting their mind to the rune coins and thinking whether these match any of them.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Oi mind, while we are showing wares here, have you ever seen the likes of these items here?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, pricing, of course!  I could see you are class fellows, I'll give you my friends discount on all of these items.  Now, the bottles are as follows - potions of healing, lesser and greater there.  A potion of waterbreating.  A potion of...  something with necrosis...  And that last... Well, that's a special one.  Not...  not quite sure what that one does.  Looks fancy, though, aye?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He begins digging out the unidentified elven boots and cloak as well as the shortswords of poisoning and the bandolier of poison vials, then lays them out for any potential identification.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, if you'd like to see the item and check it out.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>Selection timed out or was cancelled.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, bartering!  I would <i>love</i> to see...  And <i>what</i> do we have <i>here</i>?!?!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling sets to checking out the items you have.  Dieter and Maouelue pick up the stones, unwrap them from their binding and investigate their nature.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rune is not one from the set you've been looking for, but the wizard does recognize it.  These are sending stones.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few minutes in, Briffo gets uncomfortable.  "Say fellows, where...  um...  where did you get these items.  Now, mind you, I'm not opposed to some pilfered objects.  Been known to dabble in that trade myself.  Long time ago.  But these...  Lets just say, these are assassin's tools.  The shortswords are enchanted with poison.  This belt - full of poison vials!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The boots, enchanted with a stealth spell!  The cloak is elven for sure, I can only assume it has something similar on it.  Too powerful for my detection, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye...sadly we came by these tools by means of a...once and future assassin. The tale is woeful, but we would avenge the fallen. Were the tools of treachery to transmute into the teeth of retributions, oh that would a tasty sort of irony."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Do you recognize these poisons...for your part?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Where might someone concoct such filth? With what reagents?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Least ways we should take on what healing we can. I'm a bit keen on the special as well. What more can you say of these rings you are peddling?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue studies the rings with arcane intent.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"First ring there is poison resistance, second one, like the one I have on here, is a ring of protection.  Last one...  Again, I'm at a loss.  Looks pretty beat up.  Don't really remember where I came across it.  Haven't the heart to get rid of it, and no one seems to want to buy it."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "And lastly, what of this rod? It is...beautiful..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter picks up the scratched gold ring, looking at it more closely.</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is, looks in very bad shape.  Maouelue points to the rod, and the halfling smiles widely.  "Let me show you!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He picks it up, says, "Stand back a bit."  Then he points the wand in the air and <i>whoosh</i> an string of fire darts straight up into the sky.  It climbs, climbs, climbs...  When it's almost out of sight, and looks like it might have fizzled out, the wizard and druid let out the breath they were holding.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then...  <i>BOOM</i> the sky is lit up by a dazzling fireworks display!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A myriad of colors pop and fizz and explode, to the delighted clapping of Briffo.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "My word! What a sight!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Impressive trinket indeed. What do you call it?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The rod of Sky Explosions!  Might need some work on the title.  But the results speak for themselves!  Played a show once where someone set these off while I was playing.  Very good time, I can tell you."  He smiles, reminiscing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I recall a festival or two with lights that would bewitch the eyes and mind. Have you a tune for us from that night? I would love to hear it. Dieter and I here each have a bit of performative flair with the odd bit of magic as well. Might be we could make a merry scene here."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I love a bit of a show, but perhaps we had better stay focused on our mission."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Heh, perhaps you're right. Perhaps this evening, should we be so lucky to find the time."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "How about it master halfling? Would you join our cause and we could share supplies? We have a surplus of weaponry and could always use the inspiration in battle."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling is a <i>whirl</i> of emotions.  He was very enthusiastic to play, starting to take out his shawm, but slowly puts it away, nodding that it might be better to conclude business.  His face is extremely malleable, and he wears his emotions right out front!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Positively, good men, I couldn't agree more.  What... ah... What exactly are we going to that house for?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I'm all of a dither at this excitement as well. Something in the air I guess. We go to seek truth long lost, long covered in shadow."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Do you have any experience in...the art of altercation Briffo?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Or do you write your songs from afar..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, I've been in a scrap once or thrice, but, if I'm hearing you correctly...  Nothing of that like, no..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Well I won't deny, there will be dangers ahead like as not, but if you are keen to test the limits of your inspirational powers, a tunesmith would be most welcome on our travels. We can provide an array of protections on the front end and could equip you in turn."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter gestures to the Light Crossbow slung across his Clydesdale and the shortswords laid out amongst the tradegoods.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halfling looks from you two to the weapons to the horses, then back to you.  He steels himself and says, "I've been on the sidelines for far too long.  Why not, eh?!  Time to <i>make</i> some stories, not just tell of them!  I'm with ye, lads!  Er...  whoever ye are!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Ah! Have we forgotten to introduce ourselves even in that manner! Oh my, we are impetuous. I go by Maouelue, elven wizard of the woodland realms, and my companion here, Druid of the Coast, Dieter...Dieter Deleter."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "There is something wholesome about this unexpected alliance that I sense will provide us with a wrinkle of advantage in the coming days. I remember listening to the rhythms of the crickets in the dunegrass as their pulsating chirps moved in and out of phase with eachother, echoed by the waves. There is music among my people as well, and I would hear it woven into the worldly ballads of our futures."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group spends some time divvying up equipment. Dieter hands over the crossbow and poison shortswords. He dons the elven boots and hands the robe over to Maouelue to do the same. He picks up the bandolier and considers it, then looks at Briffo.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Would you use these if it were to be in the service of stopping the one who would craft such ills?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>While Dieter asks this, Maouelue picks up the RoSE and turns the three rings over in his other hand.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I might be persuaded...  If the fiend was foul enough!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Add the boots of elven kind to your inventory, but you'll have to attune to them to get the boons.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check or short rest while studying them or meditating on them, something like that.  I'm going to be afk for a bit, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was actually just going to suggest a short rest for the very purpose. I can use the SR to identify other items as well, yes? I've got the cloak and a headscarf of stealth)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool, that works!  Cloak of protection and the headscarf is going to be a homebrew item.  I can get you stats in a bit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sweeeeet!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Before we get going with the house, I wanted to run something past you...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Run away!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(I have this: https://app.roll20.net/join/6068472/bY1K8A, if that works for you.  The options are these:  We could use the Discord for the fighting, but just use Roll20 for the map; would have to change much of anything with that route.  We could use the Roll20 solely and aside from the Discord; we would have to update our characters on there OR you can use the Beyond20 web extension to basically roll from DND Beyond, and it shows as your character on Roll20.)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That last option I would have to get us generic tokens, but that's pretty easy.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I like the idea of having maps up. Will r20 work with avrae? I could get down with the extension unless running or from r20 would get us access to more content/items/feats etc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think the best way, if you're cool with it, would be to get the Beyond20 extension and have it roll for us on Roll20.  Might be a bit of a learning curve, but you code, so...  prolly not!)</p>

<p>(How would you feel about keeping the text/rolls part of this campaign in discord? I like the maps in Roll20 and think we should keep using them, but having the coms here makes it easier for me to stay connected.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(And that way we don’t have to write our own custom plugin 😆)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm totally down for that.  It's how the Ravenloft campaign goes, too.  There's really just the map and movement, just for spacing/blocking on Roll20.  We'll do that.  Want me to see if I can copy and paste the text here, or are we just starting from the jump spot?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Crazy night, just getting back in from yard work, etc!)</p><p>As the group stares at the ring, flames dance along it's mirrored surface.  The flames change to ghastly faces, to glyphs, to writing, to faces again...  The three shake their heads, as if trying to rid themselves of the visions.  The wizard, for just a moment, seizes on something from the long distant past.  A tale of old forgotten lore regarding a lost ring of invisibility and...  was it fire?  Eons ago, there was a story about a lost ring...  But as soon as it comes, the memory goes.  </p><p></p><p>Briffo takes the ring back, almost conspiratorially.

The majority of the books are tatters. barely kept together in their bindings.  There are five healthy books, though:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a contemporary interesting book entitled 'Physiologies of Magical Creatures' - Information on the biology of Beholders, Dragons, Unicorns, and more. Full of diagrams. This book is a little more eye-catching than most other mundane books.</p><p></p><p>This book is in mint condition. It is written in Common Speech. It has a lengthy foreword or dedication to someone.</p><p></p><p>This book is worth 50 gps and has 145 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
You find a contemporary guidebook entitled Remarkable Sunrises of the Great Desert: Crossroads of the Courier. This book is meant to give insight about the region of Anauroch, and the perils within.
This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Dwarvish (Dwarven Runes). It has a cover made of stone. Iron rings hold it together.
This book is worth 20 gps and has 754 pages.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a old skill book entitled Unearthed Theories on Knowledge. This book is meant to increase a wizards intelligence. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is leafed through, but otherwise good condition. It is written in Common Speech. It is obviously not written in the author's mother tongue.</p><p>This book is worth 65 gps and has 214 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a recently written skill book entitled Unambiguous Conceptions on Intimidation. This book is meant to teach intimidation techniques. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Common Speech. It has a haughty and authoratative tone.</p><p>This book is worth 40 gps and has 505 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find a contemporary biography entitled Exposed Triumphs of the Guild.</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Magical Writing (Requires Magical Deciphering). It looks to be a part of a series of volumes.</p><p>This book is worth 10 gps and has 543 pages.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a bandolier hanging on the bookshelf by a door to the W.  There is a hallway on the E wall, on it's south end.  There is another door on it's north end.  This one looks stained with something...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter walks over to inspect the bandolier.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He compares it to the poison one he carries.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a very nicely made leather bandolier, this one carries parchment.  Scroll cases and buckles adorn the carrier.  Oddly, it looks almost new.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Hmm...don't mind if I do!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He pulls it down and puts it on.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a good fit!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They move east through the door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group goes through the hallway.  More wear and tear can be seen through here.  Tapestries are moth eaten or completely ripped down.  The hallway widens to a small entry room.  A door to the N and a door to the E.  The door to the N looks stained with something.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue nods to the group and they head over to the stained door to inspect.</i></p>

<p><i>Maouelue pushes on the door and tries to open it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's hard to push initially.  All three of the group give it a go, and with a scraping, the door eases inward.  A short hallway opens into what looks like a green room.  Literally, the entire room is green with mildew and lichen, decay and rot and filth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a large bowl in the center of the room, also covered in green mold.  (This whole floor works as difficult terrain, which means your speed per round is halved.)</p>

<p><i>Maouelue extends a ghostly hand out into the middle of the room to try  and pick up the bowl to retrieve it.</i></p>

<p>The bowl is larger than the hand, and is covered in a slippery green slime...  (Strength check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage hand lifts the bowl and brings it to the wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The hand sets it down in the previous room just outside the door to the right. Maouelue directs the hand to wipe away the slime. Dieter tries to determine what the bowl is made of.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hand moves over the bowl, wiping slime and muck away.  It starts scooping out the inside as well, you see ashes coming out along with the slime.  The slime comes off, but there is still a greenish residue left after the muck is wiped completely off.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter guides his flame over gently singeing a small patch of the residue, trying to break through and see the material.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Small patches of bronze can be seen under patches of the green oxidization.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter continues to burn away what he can while the hand wipes away the char and polishes the bowl. Maouelue looks for any kind of marking.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No special markings adorn the bowl.  The polishing reveals a bronze brazier.</p>

<p>(The party is going to the entry way room, correct?  The one S of the 'green' room?)</p>

<p><i>Dieter seems compelled. Without consulting with his group, he tractors toward the vault. The others follow in defense of their enthralled companion.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Thin tendrils of blue vapor course around the door.  They wend and weave their way into and out of the scratches and markings on the doors, eventually bringing to bear twenty sigils arranged symmetrically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>As your hand covers a rune, it glows a bright purple.  The fire and ice dont seem to affect it but your presence does, or at least your intent to 'activate' the runes.  When they are all lit, they give off a brilliant radiance, filling the foyer.  Then they slowly... fade to darkness.</p>

<p>(AFK dinner)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks from the mage hand holding the bronze brazier to the green slime on the walls and floor.  He bends down to scrape some of the muck away and sees cedar wood flooring.  He does the same for the walls, and finds the same.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue sees this and he instructs the hand to continue wiping away areas of slime to reveal anything hiding underneath.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hand scours the room, unveiling a couple more bronze ewers.  But no sigils are here.  There are four doors, two on the N and two on the S.  The door to the W opens into the library. (They put a fucking sauna between an art gallery and a library?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They proceed to the north  doors and peek through both.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The one on the NW opens into damp, disgusting scraps of what used to be towels and linens.  The NE door opens onto various bottles and vials on shelves.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter never says “no” to a vial. He starts hovering them into his bag as he looks at the labels.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Mostly perfumes and soaps.  Some look a little volatile, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They leave it alone for the time being, head backward and to the west.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back to the library?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think so. I’m a little turned around, but I’m going to go through the northwest hallway making our way to the top left corner of the map.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're good!  The W door leads to the library.   This is where you picked up the scroll bandolier.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They move back through the house, through the prep kitchen and out through the east door then up to the north end of the hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall ends in a right turn, a door stands in front of the party.  It leads back to the main foyer.  Briffo scratches his head.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Kid bedtime)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I updated the map on Roll 20.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue has an idea. He runs through the house and distributes ghost crystals into the three sigil containers in numeral order.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>While his companion runs around like a mad wizard, Dieter inspects the scrolls in his bandolier.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The cold seems to linger in front of the vault doors while the party splits up to hunt for clues.  The crystals are deposited by the already found sigils.  No reaction is noticed.  Dieter's bandolier is empty... save for one carrier.  There is a bit of parchment in one.  When unfurled, it reads:
*I'm the one that cleans off the dirt
I can fall and not get hurt
Look for me to beat the heat
While I run without any feet.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pulls out his water skin and dribbles a few drops ok the parchment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The few drops soak into the parchment, partially showing a sigil under the writing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter full saturates the paper, inspecting the sigil.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The full sigil appears, it is one of the runes you've been looking for.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He catches Maouelue’s attention as he passes by and shows it to him.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What do you make of this?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They both consider the circle of runes they had seen, trying to recall the message. Maouelue thinks through what he has put together so far.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“R<i>NEM</i>R</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Markdown is messing with my underscores)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Runemark? Runemare? Runemort? Rinemire? I...this is....what is this new rune?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As he mutters, the group heads back into the prep kitchen and looks around some more.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As you say the guesses, a rumble takes the whole castle over, threatening to dump the entire second floor into the first.  After almost a minute of shaking, the house settles.  The area the party is in wasn't damaged further, but from the crashing heard after the earthquake stopped, you figure some of the house took damage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the party walks into the kitchen, a strange sight greets them.  Two of the larger knives are hovering in mid air.  They fly at the group!!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll start initiative tomorrow!  I'm beat!  Great game today.. <i>You're almost there!</i> All the clues are out, just gotta get into the final room... 😃)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>As the wraith bends over to land possibly the killing blow to the halfling man, the cold gets incredibly intense.  Almost to the point where the party can't breathe.

<p>The swirling energy is now ebbing and flowing, not a consistent blue-purple glow.  The cold has ebbed as well, but a rime of frost has built up on the apparition now.  It's brittle, crackling, creaking.  It looks scared... and dangerous.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wraith's eyes glow a bright red as it eyes Briffo.  The halfling grasps a locket around his neck and whispers something.  The claws come down.  They pass through his frame, and Dieter and Maouelue see a cloudy substance come away from Briffo's body.  The light leaves his eyes as he falls back to the cold stone floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a lightening in the foyer, a softness comes into the room.  The cold abates significantly.  A sad sort of peace comes to the two adventurers.  There is a certainty of finality here.  Not for the mission or the mysteries of the house, but for their friend.  Although they both want things to be different, the vacant stare of their newly found and newly gone friend is both heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.  The halfling wears a beatific smile, hand still clutching the totem around his necklace.  Soft sounds of rain can be heard now, pattering on the escarpments and damaged grounds of the old Muhlen Manor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “He...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “...was too young to die. He did not deserve this fate. Our cruel mission and heedless frivolity have led this poor halfling to his death...at our behest. I shall not forget this.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “What is it he clutches at?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter let’s Maouelue’s words wash over him and a steely determination sets about him. He begins to stare at Briffo with a fury, as if forcing this image into his being so that he may remember this solemn hubris. After a few moments, he closes Briffo’s eyes, then moves his hand from the locket. Dieter looks down and attempts to open it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue now comes over too and makes a ritual gesture of peace. He then bends down and begins to remove Briffo’s worldly burdens. As he does this, he pulls out the rings and the Rod of Sky Explosions. He offers the Ring of Invisibility over to Dieter and puts the Ring of Poison Resistance and the Ring of Protection on.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hands come away easily.  It is a simple locket, one with pictures inside.  A younger, smiling Briffo stands opposite a beautifully plain halfling girl.  Both are immeasurably happy.  (I'll get you a full inventory list in one sec...  Oh, and CON save, for both, please.  Disadvantage for Dieter.)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Maouelue’s trance begins to wane as he hears the sound of the song ebb into the sounds of the river and trees. He lays eyes on his companion’s slumber. “Let him sleep,” he thinks to himself, then proceeds to inspect their new equipment and keep watch on the camp while awaiting the dawn. The sky is now a dark purple, the moon ringed by seven bright stars shines down on the Wizard. “Selene, watch over us.”Be our light in the darkness, be our shield from death. Be the one who stays our dying breath...”</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair's slumber is calm, restorative.  There are strange visions occasionally flitting past, however.  Quick visions of a man with a moustache, of two serpentine sisters, of dark tunnels leading into the world; occasional frights to bitter the sweet memories of their friend's send off.  </p><p></p><p>The stars wink at Dieter.  Telling of arcane, unknowable secrets.  One of the stars goes out.  Comes back again.  The world then gets covered in darkness, but for only a second.  Whatever just passed over the moon must have been huge.  And either far away or silent.  Dieter keeps his vigil.  (Survival check from Dieter, please!)</p>

<p>Dieter can't make out what flew overhead.  Whatever it was, it sent a shiver down his spine.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Eventually the two come out of their slumber and reverie, refreshed and ready for the next leg of their journey.  (Where to?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "We need to get a lay of the land. Do we still have that old map the Miner gave us? I saw some dark beast flying this way..." 
*He points in the direction he saw the shadow traveling. Dieter then looks around to gauge their current surroundings, taking note of the direction of the river flow and looking out to the horizon to get a sense of their extended environment. He is feeling strongly pulled by the course of the water, as his time away from the coast is taking a toll on his psyche.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Aye, it would be good to gain a vantage and consider our next move carefully. Perhaps we should ride back and report to Vam and Heston with our tidings and seek a map of the greater area. I'm also keen to deliver this snakeskin and see how our budding tanner-tinker has progressed!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Aye...but first, I have one bit of unfinished business..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter packs up his things and mounts his Clydesdale with one backward glance at the mausoleum. Maoulue follows suit, and in the morning light, the two trot back over to the smouldering remnants of Muhlen Manor. Their pace slows as they approach and inspect the grounds for safe passage back to the center of the ruin.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Tendrils of smoke rise from the smoldering remains of what once was Muhlen Manor.  Between the lightning and the internal fires, nothing remains but small bits of metal, a few crude blocks of stone, and ashes...  and a marble staircase leading to a box of stone, the runed vault doors barring entrance still.  There are many places where the fire even swept into the basement level, clearing out whatever was down there.  Earthen tunnels can be seen routing the earth below the main level, with entrance holes scattered hither and yon. </p><p></p><p>As the party approaches the scene, you both notice that getting across will be dangerous at best as there is no bridge or way to access the staircase directly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers the distance to the staircase and looks for nearby sources of water.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are several puddles from the night prior.  Additionally, just over the next hill is a wonderful pond, just a bit algae-covered.  It's about 250 feet from the marble box.  (By the way, I say it's a box - it's actually a 40ft x 50ft by 20ft tall room.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue gestures for the group to follow him. He leads them around to the pond and alternately uses magic to move water over to the smoldering wreckage then freeze it, crediting an icy bridge over to the staircase.</i></p><p><i>Dieter, catching on, begins to bring hands full of gravel and dirt over to ease the passage on the icy surface.</i></p>

<p>(How do I want to make the ice bridge or proceed?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If we want to roll that back and add some chance to it I’m coo with that. Lmk.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, my fault.  So the spell takes water within a five foot cube and manipulates it, but you only have the 5ft amount of water to work with.  The stairway is about, let's say, 20 feet away...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(5ft cube = 125ft^3. I’ll make a bridge that is (25ft long <i> 1ft tall </i> 5ft wide)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They make their way towards the staircase, Maouelue lightly chuckling, but Dieter reeling himself in as he sees the dread doors again.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>It looks exactly like it did before, no marring, no soot.  You can see the sigils better now, in the light of day.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter does not hesitate. He traces the sigils in the order they have seen in their visions...the circle of runes.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I didn't want to call out the exact runes, I though that would muddy the situation, but maybe it would have helped, my bad sir.  Yes, you can identify all of the runes.  There are distinct runes from the Art Gallery, the Dining Hall, the roulette wheel, and the parchment.  They are visible on the door, in various positions.)</p>

<p>The runes are in Giant.  Maouelue is having a hard time placing the dialect or the area, but giant runes are naturally magical.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The runes on the coins read 'Runemark'.  The runes on the door are a hodge-podge, it was designed to be that way.  The specific runes in the rooms and on the parchment don't really have a correlation to anything.  You're getting the feeling that the 'runemark' password was a trap.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They touch the runes I II III IV in order</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I had conflated the two sets)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As it pushes inward, you see a cozily lit study, of sorts.  Bookshelves line the walls, the books covered in heavy leather and looking very old.  There is a massive bear-skin rug on the floor, a considerable trophy of skill and strength.  There are numerous chests in this room as well.  The entire room is lit by what looks to be ever-lasting candles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter bristles at the bear display.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue admires the candles, then pulls out the wand of secrets and releases one of its charges, searching for traps or hidden doors.</i></p>

<p>(Oh man, don't I know it! Take your time.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wand of secrets pings, points to a corner where a beautiful set of plate armor stands upright.  There is a base where the armor stand could be moved toward the door of the room.  The plate is a burnished steel, but it looks to have oxidized a bit, giving it an interesting black-green sheen to it.  The metal is dull and does not reflect any of the light shining on it. </p><p></p><p>The books smell musty but not in a damp sort of way.  They must have been here for centuries, you figure.  (History check for more!)  Maouelue takes down a book or two, inspects them.  They are in a language that is almost impossible to read... as the word never stop moving on the page.  Line after line, picture after picture, the books are a maze of movement.  Diagrams drip between pages, margins are attacked and seized.  There are many books like this.  Although, as Maouelue searches, he does find a few that are able to be read... by a wizard.  (d6 roll, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bottoms of the trunks are normal, typical wear and tear.  They seem like they've had water damage at some time or other, but nothing to hurt the solidity of them.

<p>A bevy of weapons and items greet your gaze.  A longsword sheathed in a gorgeously made scabbard.  A set of bracers with Giant runes emblazoned all over them.  A plate helm with a rime of frost on it.   A mace that glints mischievously.  A silver ring with rubies inset in a cross lies on the floor of the chest, as does a beat up looking piece of lead... with 'Runemark' inscribed on it in a circle.  Lastly, a shield with the visage of a dragon being ridden by a wizard is attached to the underside of the chest's top.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
There is a piece of parchment that catches Maouelue's eye.  It reads:
*Dearest daughter, 
  Remember that the Barbarian's Wind is* magical *!
  Only speak the word to unlock it's secrets.
                          Love, Father*
There is a Giant rune underneath the word Father, in a different script.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gonna need a little bit here)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries at all, playing goalie over here, too!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter picks up the shield and tests its balance.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "There's a lot of gear here, we may need to sit and consider it a bit."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group takes a short while to sit and consider the items they have found here. The henchmen take a look at the helm and mace, Dieter looks at the bracers and shield, and Maouelue looks at the ring and staff.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue passes the sheet of parchment around as they do this.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As they go about the equipment, they lay it all out on the ground so as to make an outline of the wearer, shield on the right, sword on the left with a bracered arm and scabbard hung low, the helm facing upward, the mace hung opposite the scabbard, and the ring, just where the hand might poke out from behind the shield in combat.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(For the fun of it, group Arcana check!  Even the henchmen - just roll at advantage for them.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Henchmen just duped stats?)</p>

<p>(I don't have a separate sheet, but I can get one.  I was thinking these would be duplicates, but if you're feeling personalities, we can make that happen!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It could be fun to have it roll from 4 dudes! I like the idea of the party makeup potentially shifting around when that item gets used and having to respond accordingly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can get the deets for three items, by the way.)</p><p>(Cool, I'll start making the characters.  They'll be shared in the 'Campaigns' section of Beyond.  Don't know if you can edit the non-assigned characters, but feel free to try.  Let me know if you can.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I should be able to import them here and just claim/unclaim to update if needed.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's not an option to edit them unless you claim them, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Actually i can)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, this will work. I don't have to claim at all to use them.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(K, they're both on there.  Let me know if you have any issues editing.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They're not going to be able to level up, no.  One should be fine.  We can get you some hirelings or something if you want to level up some subordinates!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(Ok cool. I think that works well, since the item is OP already :). )

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I would like to be able to equip them with shit I have in my bags though if that's cool.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(But I assume it would all fall to the ground when the spell is up etc, so they would need to take the time to equip it next time they are summoned.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Staff of Baobab is special.  It can only be used by a druid.  When inserted into soil, a great baobab tree grows (you can decide the height & look).  The tree bears only two pieces of fruit per growth.  This fruit, when consumed, heals 1 disease and does 8d4+8 healing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A pure feeling of life seems to seep into Dieter's being as he takes the staff from Maouelue.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It is OP, isn't it?!  Maybe you're just using it well!!  I was thinking it would work where they're fresh each time out, but I think we can make some concessions here.  Since they have personalities, there's an argument that they should keep their equipment, etc.  You can almost use them like a follower in Skyrim, pack them full of stuff.  These guys, though, go to an extra-planar dimension when their time is up.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That works! I love it!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Reset/charges on the staff?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The shield is called the Shield of Disruption.  Adds +1 to your AC and it has 4 charges to impose a CON save (DC10+Intelligence modifier) on a creature using any spell.  You can spend 1 charge against the spell, or spend more for higher level spells.  (If you wanted to counter a spell at 5th level or above, the DC would go down by 3 for every level higher.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The staff can only be used once every seven days.  Only once charge in that timeframe.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mace twinkles in the candlelight.  This is the Mace of Reduction.  The attack and damage rolls have +1, crits on 19 and 20, and on a natural 20 the target is under the effect of the <i>Reduce</i> spell.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'd really like to see the coding for the items, though.  I might be able to backward generate the specs for the homebrew items, but I can't get the coded info to generate anywhere.  I'll have to check into what you're been doing, it looks complicated but I could sit down a bit with it, see what's going on.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Looks like we can each create collections and subscribe to eachother's stuff. Then to view we just need to unrestrict homebrew items in the character editor home tab)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I saw something that said homebrew content was automatically shared with those in your campaign.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You were doing the mace, you said?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That should work, then!  Maybe that's just the purchased stuff?  I was working on the mace, yeah.  Stopping point was the crit range.)</p>

<p><i>The group ruffles through the burgeoning bags of holding to produce the Barbarian’s Wind tome. Dieter holds it in his hand and speaks the rune using his most ostentatious form of Giant.  (He loves to be very presentational in front of the henchmen...)</i></p>

<p>(Sorry bud, you wanted to do the short rest and attune to everything, correct?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the druid holds the book aloft and speaks the Giant rune, the book glows a glittery blue hue.  The words on the page magically rearrange themselves into different words, pictures, diagrams.  As they come together and form a completely new tome, a sharp pain courses through Dieter's head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the words coalesce, Dieter has a harder and harder time concentrating on the book.  At the height of his ability, he's still not able to comprehend the language or read the book at all.  His headache starts to get worse...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The shield resets at short or long rest.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Hand me....ugh....hand...GIVE ME THAT HELM!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Stenchy picks it up and hands it over to Dieter, who hastily puts it on, not fully knowing what it will do.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>It's a bit awkward to hold the book while putting the helm on, but Stenchy lends a hand to help him sort it out.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the helm goes on, a feeling of sharp cold comes over Dieter.  It helps quell the pain of his head, but only momentarily.  (Is he still trying to read it?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cold abates and Dieter starts feeling comfortably warm, noticing for perhaps the first time how cold his surroundings really were before.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter sets the book down momentarily and produces a flame, he sends a bit of it into each of the emptied rune chests to provide some additional light and heat in the room. He gestures to Maouelue to take a look at the book.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouleue picks up the tome and tries to read some of it as well. He wonders whether he'll have the same searing experience.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is able to read it perfectly.  It is the musings of an arcanist who was obsessed an ancient race of people called the Netherese.  The land of Netheril was located where the Anauroch desert is today, and a mageocracy of peoples inhabited the land.  Thousands of years ago, the archmages of Netheril controlled magics unheard of, and with their prideful demise, most of the artifacts and knowledge died with them.  That did not stop this particular arcanist from searching, and clearly finding, books and items from the bygone era.  This spellbook is both an account of what the arcanist was able to glean from the books in this library, as well as his dabbling into some of the forgotten magics therein.  The books and items in this room are priceless, worth more than a mansion in Waterdeep for some buyers.  Collectively, you could be looking at millions of platinum to the right person.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "An interesting tale to be certain...Now which of the Lord's daughters do you think was...*dearest*?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I know not, but this mystery seems to know no bounds. We should take what we can and move on."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group packs up their things and Dieter coalesces the fire and moves it over toward the plate armor.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Stenchy looks admiringly at the armor and sizes himself up against it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Stenchy: "Egh bosse....I can try eet on?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Let's shove it aside first and see what happens..."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Who is touching the armor first?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As Dieter is responding, Stenchy is already coveting the armor and running his sweaty hands over the epaulets.</i></p>

<p>The armor, holding Dieter, takes the hit from the mace on it's helm.  The blow rocks the plates, causing a great <i>clang</i> to bounce around the room.  As the hit happens, the party sees the green of the mace deepen and sparkle.  The armor, still ringing, starts shrinking into a smaller version of itself!  The armor is now approximately 9 inches tall.  It looks up at the druid, wondering what in the hell happened.  It's still hugging Dieter's leg.</p>

<p>The spider moves 20 feet per 6 seconds.  SpiDieter crawls vertically down the shaft, moving swiftly.  Three hundred feet down, a full minute and a half later, the spider feels the wall turn away ninety degrees to create the ceiling of a massive cavern.  Stalactites dot the roof of the cavern, making it difficult for the spider to see farther than five feet in front.  From this vantage point, the spiDieter cannot see the floor of the cavern.</p>

<p>The group makes their way down the ladder.  It's not as rickety as you would think, the handholds are secure.  There is a bit of a scare when Frenchy slips on a rung.  Other than that, everyone gets down.  The water at the edge of the cavern, at the bottom of the ladder, is only a foot deep.  The henchmen are wading, waiting for the wizard.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Only the wizard has darkvision.  Did you want to light a torch or set a light?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The Henchy brothers each light a torch as they look for drier footing.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The water extends before the brothers' torches.  Maouelue can just see the edge of a small island in the middle of the cavern.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue drops down the final rung and looks around. He looks around for Dieter but doesn't see him. He takes a few tentative steps toward the center island, pulling out his Quarterstaff to test the depth as he goes.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes four steps, then the staff registers the floor falls away abruptly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He beckons to the Henchys to follow him and walks around the perimeter counter clockwise to a small just he sees on the East wall. He once again tests the waters as he steps out and gauges the distance to the center. It looks to him like about 20ft at that point. He begins to pull up a large cube of water from the area, hovering it in the air and spinning the 125 cubic feet of water in a mesmerizing ball that flickers reflections of the flames all over the cavern. He slowly begins to extend the water into a long bridge, similar to the one used above ground, this time considering the terrain, he makes it slightly narrower with higher sides to act as railings. He then leads the group across, giving Dieter time to do...whatever it is he needed to do so badly...</i></p>

The snake-man smiles as he effectively disappears from view of the wizard and the henchmen.  Dieter is still hanging on for dear life.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The snake has 15 ft reach on his tail/constrict attack, I was playing it as he's still waded out a bit into tue water.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue focuses his energy on the area where he last saw the snake and begins to weave his arms in the air, all of the fog in range begins condensing into orbs of ice spaced about 5 feet apart. It's quite a sight as he releases and lets them all drop.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Let me know your take on that. I've got one read on it that since the fog isn't dense it means that the overall amount of water should fit into the 5x5x5 cube when condensed and so it should clear the whole range. LMK your take)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What overall range are you going for?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If I can do 60ft in all directions in front or around Maouelue that would be ideal.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Since that is the range of the spell. Do you think the spell reads like I’m thinking?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think maybe this spell doesn’t care about density on second read, but would be dope if it worked that way. If no go on that, he does the same thing in a line toward the snake.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok I did some more reading and the 5’ cube is the bounding box of the spell. So no go on pulling it from everywhere. There are a few takes on whether or not I’m allowed to manipulate fog with this at all since it is not in liquid form.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry for the delay, just doing some reading on this.  Seems to be a bit of contention in the D&D community, actually!  Give me one more sec...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No prob! I like this kind of investigation actually.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I can't do this now that I'm reading more.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The wording seems to be 'an area of water that you can see within range - 30ft - and that fits in a 5ft cube.  I think there's an argument to be made that. since you can freeze the amount of water you need to make a bridge, you take 5ft cube and it makes as much ice.  The density doesn't matter there because, I'm using the ice-cube theory, the water you put in is the water you get out.  Steam is different, and I think should be treated as such.  The question is how much steam or fog would a 5ft cube make?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think you have to take liquid water then change its form and not the other way around. There are other spells that manipulate fog, so i get it. )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He casts that in the last place he saw the snake)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I would say Maouelue could target the Shape Water spell on a certain pinpoint.  If he's creating ice or moving water, it can go for the 5ft cube.  If he's manipulating liquid as a gas, I would say the range of the spell is targeted, so that's a 30ft cube.  There are spells that deal with fog specifically, but I think there's a point to be made with Shape Water.)</p>

<p><i>The adventurers feel the tension strangely slipping away as they break bread and regale each other with their feelings about the last battle. It's quite a merry band by the end of the rest. Their spirits are in much higher order now that they've been replenished. And now, they begin to think about a way out...and loot. They love loot.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Second wind resets on short or long rest.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Frenchy: "Iz eet me, or deed we neglecte to searche ze roome properly?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(We did a SR for attunement and such up in the bear rug chamber, yeah? I know I used it and expected it to be gone, but both my sheets had it available. I'm thinking it reset back then. Your call.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(My understanding is you can short rest at any time, you just won't have all of your hit die every time.  If you use hit die on a short rest, they don't come back until after a long rest, and then you only get half of your available hit die at that time.  So, if you use four hit die now, after you take your next long rest, you'll have 2 hit die to use for a next short rest.  You don't have to use hit die at a short rest, you can just SR to attune if you need to.  I think that's what you did up in the vault room.  You took all of the major items, did you want to go check for more?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Or did you want me to go over the new items, because I prolly forgot to do that!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was thinking more about looking at the Snake corpse if we can.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The longsword is called 'The Blade of the Mists', +1 longsword.  Contains 2 charges, Misty Step.  After you make a successful hit, you can cast as a bonus action.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'm cool with the hit die. I didn't use any upstairs. Come to think of it, I don't know why I would have had any reason to use Second Wind all day since I don't think the suit of armor PWND stenchy that bad. I'll double check)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bracers are 'Bracers of the Giantess'; Once per day you can slam the bracers together and cast <i>Enlarge</i> on yourself.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The plate helm is the 'Frostbitten Helm'; grants wearer resistance to cold damage.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(found it, i did take an sr upstairs, but it was before the armor fight where he used SW, so I'll remove the HP)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silver ring inset with rubies in the form of an x or + is the 'Ring of Aid'; Once per day you can activate it to give the wearer 1d6 healing at the beginning of their turn.  Or, out of combat, can heal from 1d6 to 1d36 points of healing - basically 6 charges of 1d6 healing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'll brew them up on Beyond if I can. Dope items btw! Thanks.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also, as we play and I read more, I'm learning little bits and pieces like "Druids don't wear metal" and "Shillelagh requires mistletoe and a shamrock" so I'll try to be better about that going forward.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yep, I guess they all are!  Can't find them in the lookup at all.  Let me know if you need me to help with them.  They should be fun for you.  And I'll give you a hint...  There's a theme in them, harkens back to something you've heard relating to the black spot and the coins...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(these are all magic items with attunement reqs yeah?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That's a Giant clue)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Those are suggestions, especially for people who aren't really psyched or versed with RP.  You play how you play, you're doing awesome.  As for materials, I'm not worried about the small stuff.  If you want to add it as flavor, please feel free.  When it comes time to resurrect someone and you need a jeweled bowl worth 1000 gold, <i>then</i> I'll be a stickler!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They are all magical items, they required attunement to figure out what they were, but they don't all require attunement to use.  The weapons and armor are the biggies on that.  The ring, no.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So...  you're going NE, huh?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kek, I'm thinking about it. I'll need a little bit to get the items together and to reassess what attunements I do have/need.)</p>

<p>(I think I've basically got it set for now, just one question, do the bracers count as armor i.e. require attunement?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yessir.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kk. Going to update in a sec then. I haven't fully built Quenchy yet, but maybe he'll be a drunken monk. I think I've got him as a ranger right now.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(and no AC on either the helm or bracers, right?)</p>

<p>(Would you be down to add another friend into this adventure sometime in the next week or so? You might remember my old friend Dan Kohl from back in the day. He and I got to talking and I thought it might be cool to hook him in at some point where it makes sense. He’s got a meet up campaign going but it’s really slow because it’s only every 1-2 weeks. I think he wants to play a bear totem barb or something.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I would totally be down for that!  Would you want a restart, or add him to the current?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Add to current I think. I gave him a synopsis of the action so far. I was thinking maybe we meet him for some reason after this current dungeon/thrust. Sounds like he’s a bit busy this week, so we’d have a little time to work it in.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Any time he wants to join, I'm more than happy to add him in.  If he wants to add me in Discord or email me to get me background info or whatever, feel free to throw him my contact info.)</p>

<p>(BTW, I like your rp of Amber, you're nailing it!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group moves together along the NE tunnel.  Frenchy sees much better now, noticing that after forty or so feet, the tunnel takes a turn due E.  The light shines forty feet in advance of the party, dimming at the edge of that distance.  The tunnel continues straight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party starts noticing that the tunnel looks carved out of the clay heavy soil.  It is ten feet high, a little less than ten feet wide.  The walls look damp but not wet.  A heavy smell of earth hangs everywhere.  Along with the tang of iron, but that could be from your bloodstained clothes...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silence is the worst part.  Sounds echo, every footfall, even though they're quiet, sound like a heavily laden <i>thump</i> as you all walk.  Stenchy sounds like a bucket of silverware jouncing around.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'm an anime girl at heart)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'll send your DC info along to him. Looking forward to that!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue winces at each echoing step, but there's not much for it at this point. He makes a palms down gesture to Stenchy trying to get him to lighten his footsteps. Stenchy makes a show of understanding and doing so, but it does almost nothing to change the clatter.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!  In all honesty, Barbarians are my favorite class!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter tells Maouelue and Stenchy to hold for a moment and takes the torch from Stenchy, moving forward along the passage with Frenchy to scout a bit more stealthily.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You both feel an urge to vomit as the wood plank is moved away.  It stretches the width of the floor and extends to fifteen feet forward down the tunnel.  The wood feels flimsy under your fingers.  You both can also see that the tunnel tapers at the edge of the torch light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Steadying themselves and holding their breath, they look for what might be the source of the stench under the board.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(Nope!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group takes the NE path, moving quietly...  except for Stenchy.  The wizard, who is constantly checking behind himself for fear of being snuck up on, spies something <i>slithering</i> and skittering down the path behind them.   (Survival check from whomever is leading the group - Frenchy, right?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The path continues on.  As the group continues on,  they see a three-foot diameter hole in the ceiling of the tunnel, directly above them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter raises his flame to the hole to try and light it up a bit.</i></p>

<p>(Yeah)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party moves onward.  (Good movie by the way, if you haven't checked it out!)  </p><p>The path continues on...  ten feet, twenty more...  Fifty more...  The skittering keeps pace with Maouelue, staying just at the edge of his vision.  He sees it crawling on the ground.  Then loses it for a time.  The party can hear the sounds of little claws hitting the stones in the floor, clicking together... unnerving them.  Until, suddenly...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Onward is SO GOOD!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tunnel opens into a strange cavern.  The walls arch overhead quickly, almost at a 90 degree angle.  Sounds echo frightfully here.  There are noises of dripping and the slight splashing of water.  The torch illuminates the area, but only just.  The room seems to be getting bigger and bigger the farther they go.</p>

<p>The wizard looks around as the other three huddle and shine lights around the area.  They are in a large open space.  The three without darkvision are not able to see the walls, but they can hear noises bouncing all around the cavern.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue searches the area, looks up the wall and sees...  a grub-like creature clinging to the wall about twenty feet up.  It's about the length of a grown human's leg, and about a foot in diameter.  It is looking at Maouelue.  Strands of spittle hang from its maw.  As the liquid hits the floor of the cave, it hisses.</p>

<p>(Where's an infinitely respawning camp of kobolds when you need it?!?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(The mechanics for the watch: Since Maouelue is a full elf, he would only need to get 4 hours of reverie to be 100%.  You can set up camp where everyone sleeps, survival checks would be needed, and you could get snuck up on.  For those on watch, as long as they get 8 hours,  they can benefit from the long rest.  Perception checks would be needed for those on watch during those hours.  How did you want to stagger the sleep/reverie?)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’m planning on having the henchmen take the first and second watch to give mao his 4 hours, then he can take over. Presumably they will disappear when the 24 hours is up, so I’m always baiting them a bit in that way.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue rests by the fire watching the flames. He relaxes his mind into its usual meditative sequence, going over the events of the day, then casting them toward the stars in his mind's eye. Here in the dark cavern, his memory of starlight is lifeblood. Life...he considers this a moment...his run ins with death... These musings form a blip in his usual steady trance. The scene of Briffo's burial blends with the stars. His song comes in and bends its drifting lines, tracing constellations. Now slowly a low hiss grows and distorts the glorious notes, a cruel laugh, darkness begins to set in. Then a flash of platinum blue sears the scene...there is only one constellation, burning radiantly wavering obscuring all else. An outline only visible in the relief of pure light begins to resolve...The vision of divine justice, of good, the king of dragons....Bahamut's form sears itself into the mind's eye. Maouelue is no longer controlling this meditation, this is something else...A silent voice in his head speaks. It says to him simply, "Life." Then the form turns and begins to alight back to the stars, the form now more visible in the new relief of darkness, the void of space feeling ever deeper than ere it has. As Bahamut set wing to space, the last fleeting glimpse before he took flight was dimmed only by a spectral Briffo, nestled in the crook of a wing, looking out over the vast expanse. He lifts a platinum lute and strikes a final chord, fleetingly winking back into Maouelue's eye. Then....it's all gone. The darkness of the abyss becomes the shadows of the cavern receding to the flickering flames of the fire. Maouelue comes to changed. He knows now in his heart he must use his power to bolster the forces of good and channel his power into life. He stands, a new radiance seems to emit from him, awe inspiring, yet distancing. This new strength seems to come at the cost of a certain kind of knowability, but not loyalty or honesty.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This hunt for the Muhlen sisters is no longer a curiosity. It is a divine decree. Let the roots of evil be laid low for their treachery though the purification of the very soil to which it has taken root.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As he rises, he looks at the frenchmen, their new brethren. He holds a hand to each of their shoulders and says a prayer. He traces the mark of Bahamut in his minds eye as they disappear back into the ether...back into the mirror. A sad, yet pure knowing sets over him as he begins to don the now-empty plate mail. He affixes the Giantess Bracers and Frostbitten Helm. He sets his scabbard to his waist and picks up Frenchy's dagger. Digging around in his pack for a moment, he pulls out a stray piece of silver ore that must have settled to the bottom during their journey. Holding it over the fire with the dagger, he warms the metal and it drinks in the firelight. Bringing it back out, he sets it on the Shield of Disruption and begins shaping it into a draconic form. A symbol for his new devotion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Holy...!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns, expecting to see the stranger from the fight before.  Instead, he sees a blond man, ethereal, radiating powerfully bright aura around him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your faith will be your reward.  Know that I will be here, watching over you.  When you most need me, look to the East, look for your patron."</p><p>He touches your shoulder, sending radiant energy through the wizard's body.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he disappears, and Maouelue looks back to the shield, you sense the metal is different now.  On closer inspection...  the metal dragon is platinum.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>An ebullition of all proportions sears into the cavity in Maouelue's chest, swelling him from his very core outward. A divine pride and devotion seem to reinforce the very sinews of his being. He picks up the shield and slings it over his left arm. His fingers grip the hilt of the sword and he unsheathes it, holding it point upward directly between his eyes. He lets the firelight bend off the sharpened edges of his sword into the back of his mind. Then he stands his silent vigil over the camp.</p>

Whatever this new faith was, it would clearly help lead to the destruction of this coven that seemed to be taking him further and further from his homelands. He longs for a sight of the sea, and the liquid reflections of the pure metal on Maouelue's shield briefly take him there. He nods back into the unrelenting stare. Gathering up what bits of equipment the henchmen...no! Frenchy and Stenchy...had left behind. He remembers something suddenly, then looks around the scene.<i>Dieter is all at once taken aback and on board with the mission.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Right, right."  He rips something from the orc's hide, wipes his knife on the dead creature's ragged clothing, and sheaths it.  He puts the hide patch into his pack, then points E.  "A bit of a walk thata way is a stone entrance, 'bout 3 feet wide, 7 foot tall, aye?  All I know about it about seven or eight of those bastards guarding it.  The orcs that came through here got into a scrape with them, couldn't quite see if they finished all of the snakies, but that might be a good place to start for the day?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter, having had a moment now to absorb this change in his companion, begins to feel bolstered by this confident crusade. Since his last musings on the mirror, he felt empowered having a point of focus foe the battle in front of him...one for whom he wouldn’t have to bear the soulful burden of summoning. In a tight spot, Dieter knew deep down he would be happy to see the countrymen again, but for now he would use the shadow cast by his radiant friend to obfuscate his approaches and gain his advantage. It’s time now to serve the serpents a certain serenity.</i></p>

<p>The party moves further in the cavern and is able to glean a few things.  Firstly, there are no exits save from whence they came.  There are four serpent beings milling about the front of a door, framed and made of stone.  Maouelue can see that there are bodies on the ground, a couple of the snake-beings are tending to them.  They're just off to the side of the door.  Lastly, the wizard sees that the door is odd in the sense that it doesn't have a handle or any other obvious way to open it.</p>

<p>The group can't quite lock on to the history of the symbol.  Dieter recalls it belonging to an ancient race of serpents, but the specifics are eluding him.  Maouelue has been in this hall for some time, and he has been soaking up the details.  The torches, oddly, seem recently lit.  There are two doors on the right, two doors on the left, and a large, oaken door at the end of the hall 35 feet away.  The oaken door has a strange looking handle on it.  The ceiling is carved and there are wood beams running lengthwise along the passage.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No name or message.  Looks to Maouelue like a pauper's coffin.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wood is distressed in places, splintering here and there.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He beckons Dieter to help him lift the lid.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The lid is nailed down, but the wood is so old the nails don't catch like they once did.  The wizard and the druid are able to get their fingers into crevices and <i>pull</i> up.  The lid lifts off, revealing a clay statue of a snake-warrior, arms crossed over their chest.  A clay depiction of a scimitar is as if it were in the warrior's hip scabbard.  The eyes are gold bits, but they look too small to be standard currency gold pieces.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They lower the lid back down and move across the hall to the opposite door for a similar inspection.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find the exact same thing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Sensing the pattern, the group moves to the back right room.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This is a larger room that the last, the archway has some words written in snake-ese.  The door pulls open to reveal a coffin, slightly smaller that the other two.  There are reliefs on the walls depicting snake-men using magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two magic users slow and take their time inspecting the reliefs, carefully examining the magical effects being represented.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The depictions are of destruction magics, vile and ancient.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes out his sketchbook and begins drawing a facsimile of the two murals. While the wizard draws his strokes, Dieter has Frumious assist him with the next coffin lid.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This statue is smaller and is clothed in what used to be fancy purple robes.  Tatters remain.  The hands are crossed and there is a silver ring on the hand resting on top.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter steps back, considering this a moment while he pulls out a red bottle and pulls the cork with this canines, spitting it into the corner. He lets out a sneering hiss at the statue as he pulls back and lowers the contents down his gullet, wincing slightly and shaking his neck and shoulders.</i></p>

<p><i>As Maouelue flits around inspecting the finer points of shadow and highlight, his eye is drawn to the silver ring. He sets his drawing down in his pack and moves to it, hovering his palm over it feeling for traces of the arcane.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard waves his hand and checks for traces of the arcane, a voice utters deep in his mind.  He cannot understand the words, but they are foreboding, menacing.  Guttural grunts mixed with hisses echo in the man's head.  There is a whisper of common underlying everything, though.  It sounds like "weapon".</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He pulls his palm back, frowning gravely. He then waves the group to the opposite room, leaving this coffin open for the time being.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They proceed across the corridor.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room opposite is structured exactly like this one, except for a décor of magic, there is a ambiance of learning and scholar here.  There is a small bookshelf in the corner, all of the items are withered to dust though.  The coffin opens on a smallish serpent-scholar, bedecked in tattered robes of deep blue and silver.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue bends in closer to the serpent scholar looking for any symbols of devotion or knowledge that might have been lain with the form.</i></p>

<p><i>Maouleue takes the point of his blade and begins slicing out the symbol, the tucks it into his book.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid thinks back over his many years of observance for his religion.  Nothing stands out directly, but something about a long-lost or ousted serpentine race once idolized the symbol nags the back of his mind.  Nothing specific comes together for either of the men.</p>

<p>The finger comes off along with the ring.  The clay statue was hollow and filled with a poisonous gas.  As the gas seeps out, Maouelue clocks it early and is able to jump out of the room in time.  It dissipates, only delivering one point of damage to the Dragon Mage.</p>

<p>As the party gets to their feet, they are greeted by another torch-lit room.  It's oval in general shape, 35ft side to side, 20ft deep, with a small alcove to the S  (The door you came through is on the W).  On the N wall are three wooden coffins, similar to the ones you've seen before.  There is a <i>much</i> larger coffin on the S side, just N of the alcove, running W to E lengthwise.

<p>The reliefs tell of some battles between an ancient race of serpents called Naga, and their elven, human, and dwarven enemies.  These depictions show the Naga as heroic vanquishers of the humanoid races.  (More in a sec.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the short rest wanes, you receive a rush of emotion as you connect with the silver ring.  It is a device made by the Naga, a weapon of sorts.  If you put it on, you can retain a particular skill the Naga possess.  It would transform a part of your body into a serpent appendage, giving it the ability to deliver poison damage with an unarmed strike.  Maouelue feels dread and a sense of warning, but at the same time, emanating in waves from the object, he feels a great sense of power and righteous anger.</p>

<p>The sense you get from the ring, tapping into the Naga-created object, pushing into the understanding of the types of beings these serpents were...  Dieter is pummeled by a barrage of emotion, mainly vengeance.  Anger and pain war within him as he senses the motives of the Naga.  These beings are pure hate and atrocity.  They wanted nothing more to see the world burn and be recreated by their serpent gods.  Magical items they made for themselves are extremely powerful.  Those left for whomever might find them have...  secrets.</p>

<p>There is no trace of the other Muhlen sister.  As Maouelue inspects the corpse, he sees the skin is bubbling and sizzling.

(Con save and investigation check if you're going to inspect the body more closely).</p><p></p><p>The potions are numerous and multi-colored.  You do see red potions you know to be potions of healing.  There are also dark, foreboding vials.  A green, effervescent tincture. </p><p> A purple/yellow mixture that is constantly swirling.  All in all, a variety of ghastly stuff.  The other thing you notice is the lack of ingredients for potion making.  There are herbs hanging and a few items in the middle of being chopped and prepared.  But for the quantity of empty bottles, there aren't many ingredients for new brews.</p>

<p><i>Maouelue fiddles with his bracers as he digs, then removes them in favor of an amulet. He would need to pray over the items in the dawnlight before using them again.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue remembers seeing Veena change in front of them all, he knows they are Naga now.  He also knows that it takes a powerful Naga to walk around amongst humans, and for so long.  Naga absolutely loathe humanoids.  To walk among them would be tantamount to blasphemy.  There must be something else at work here other than Naga trying to fit into a society, or ingratiate themselves into a community like Oakhurst.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(For the perception:)  Looking around the vestibule area they're in, Mao wonders how the chittering beast even got in here.  There is a door (ajar) on the south wall.  The rest of the walls are adorned with carvings that have been raked over many, many times.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group picks up and carries on toward the next door, toward their fate.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Dieter: "So many snakes..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Not just snakes....Naga...I wonder if we met Lord Muhlen back in the tomb...."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight on that, but it's a high DC!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The team exits the S door, it's already open.  It swings wide into a 5ft wide hallway.  To the party's right there is another solid oaken door, banded with iron, 5ft away.  To their left (E) the corridor continues straight, opening into a vast room with high ceilings (30 ft) and massive pillars.  Just before that room is a hallway to the S.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They try to open the door.....ON THE RIGHT!</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(WHA?! 🤣)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That thing in the tomb could have been Lord Muhlen.  Mao isn't quite sure.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door on  the <i>right</i> opens onto a beautiful golden idol.  Made in a very ornate, flowing design, it depicts one snake, rising into the air, while it's tail curves and wends its way toward the creature's mouth.  It is 10ft tall, what looks to be solid gold, and is positioned on a square onyx base.  (Inspection or perception checks for more!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks at it - looks like a pretty nice statue!  When Maouelue takes a closer inspection, his elven eyes pierce a veil on the idol.  Firstly, the thing is extremely well crafted.  Looks possibly to even be on elvish make.  Second, its a mobius strip oroborous.  However is was constructed, there seems to be only one side to the snake.  Perfectly formed, you marvel at how this was accomplished.  Lastly, you see there are fine gems inset for the eyes.  They burn a bright red-gold in the torchlight.  They are so close in color to the gold, you might have never seen them if you hadn't been inspecting so closely.</p>

<p><i>Frowning, they leave the statue alone and close the door. They then lead on to what would originally have been left.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You could swear you hear a seductive hissing as you shut the door behind you...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party continues and comes to the fork.  There is a hallway to the right.  Maouelue sees, with his dark vision, a thirty foot hallway that ends with another oaken door.  In front of the party, you get a better view of the large room before you.  Besides the pillars, there are many other statues here.  These are not gold, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They turn right toward the door at the end of the hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall trends downward, maybe dipping 5ft in all.  The door at the end of the hall is unlocked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They go in</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door <i>creaks</i> open, revealing a dark cavern warren.  The walls, ceiling, and ground are all poorly dug out dirt.  Roots and vines twine through all.  There are ratty bags of feathers, rags, bowls of grease, and bat guano covers pretty much everything.  As you take a step in, crunching of small insect shells echo and grate your senses.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes a few feathers and corks another bottle of grease.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The grease smells <i>awful</i>.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They eff back off to the last hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm sorry, more info, my bad...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a causeway in the SE corner of the room that lead to more caverns.  One goes E, the other S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They take note of this and head back to the the other hallway.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back to the large room, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You enter the massive room, torchlight doesn't even reach to the other end nor does it illuminate the ceiling.  Maouelue can see the dimensions of the room, but the bright light is limited.  (Perception or Investigation on anything, let me know!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks for any sconces or braziers</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are several, all throughout the chamber.  Some still have torches in them, but they look like they've gone to seed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are statues of humanoids, goblins, orcs, a variety of beings littered around the room.  No rhyme or reason, it seems.  The pillars have sculpted snakes running  the length of their 30ft height.  These are very finely crafted.</p>

<p>You hear a disembodied voice say (in everyone's mind), "Your payment was accepted."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A small chamber on the front of the onyx base opens with a <i>puff</i> and a small drawer is revealed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Good thing we didn’t got with our...*first* instinct, eh Mao?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue inspects the drawer.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A book is the only thing in the drawer.  It is well made, bound in a strange type of thinnish, padded leather.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The mage reaches in and grabs it gently, pulling it up to inspect it more closely.</i></p>

<p>(Also afk. Anniversary!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, man, go enjoy.  And happy anniversary!  And a happy birthday tomorrow!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter peers at the journal, mildly peeved at the wizard for just grabbing it first...wasn’t he the one that was infatuated?</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s tongue flicks out in anticipation.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's mind is taken away to a room...  a familiar room filled with foreign, magical books and chests with hidden treasures.  At an ornate desk, a gray-haired man sits, writing.  The book is the same as the one Maouelue holds.  Words are being poured over and transcribed into the tome.  Time progresses.  Maouelue sees the elder mage return time and again to the book.  Finally, with a heavy <i>thump</i> the gray-haired mage, looking much older, shuts it an gives it a pat.  The mage calls out of the room.  Two young women answer the call.  The mage ushers them in a shuts the large doors.  In an instant his features turn serpentine, and the two girls react in terror.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He calms the two young ones, lets them see he means them no harm.  He shows them the book he's been working diligently on.  Time progresses more.  As the old man gets older, the two women grow.  Eventually the old man does not show up again and the two women are the only ones using the book.  As the time slows, giving Maouelue the feeling of finality, he sees one of the women steal into the room, grab the book, and retreat down a hidden ladder in the floor.  The other comes in moments later, chasing her.  The vision fades and Maouelue is standing, staring at words of a mage, surging green in the torchlight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Some words are able to be read, some are in a language he cannot understand.  A portion of the tome reads as a diary, expressing the mage's struggles with deciphering the Netherese books he's found.   Another portion of the book contains translations, or approximations, of several Netherese texts.  Lastly, there are several spells the mage seemed to be working with.  It is almost as if the mage was reverse engineering spells based on the information he was gleaning.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Only a wizard can use these spells and read the contents within.  You can either take a spell from first to sixth to add to your spellbook.  Or you can create 1 of your own spells.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oooooooooh)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes the time and stows it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “This will take time to decipher either the proper care. I fear we have gleaned what we can do these caves, but let us persist until the way is shut...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They head back now to the way beyond the lord of stools.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The party starts to move out of the hallway back to the goblin warren.  Frume is having some trouble getting up, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Here let me give you a...”
“...some assistance.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here, take this...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter hands him a standard shield. Hopefully the fighter can at least wield that...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks at it, wincing.  "No.  I... ah...  I don't that'll do, lad.  Might be needing to find another home for me other sword, p'haps."  How holds his stump up to the torchlight to examine it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Come with us brother. We will seek true healing for you. There are ways...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye.  I'll take what I can get.  I in the meantime... you lead the way, gentlemen."   He tries at a smile.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Hmm...let me see that other sword of yours...if er...if that’s alright.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the two sort out the equipment, Maouelue walks in down the hall.</i></p>

<p>As the party makes its way through goblin warrens, you peek into the room you missed on the right the first time you passed by.  Dieter sticks his head in.  This room tapers to the back wall and the corners.  It is littered with dung, egg shells, and noxious fumes.  The floor is a viscous mud/dung mix.  He doesn't see anything or anyone in the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Carry on, nothing down here.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens smoothly, opening onto a domed hall.  Three doors exit from this room on the N, E, and S.  The S door is very elaborate, iron-wrought, with an odd keyhole in it's center.  There is a broken wooden door to the E.  To the N, an opaquely transparent barrier presents itself, the flicker of orange flames beckon beyond.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three approach the opaque glass-like substance of the orange-lit door.  There is no obvious sign of a knob or way to open it.  (How would the group like to attempt to open the door?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They don't yet attempt to open the door. They head back to the South end of the room and inspect the strange lock.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The beautifully made door is solid iron.  Buffed to a fine polish, some of the filigree and hand-formed sections are minute, even for Maouelue's keen eye.  The scene depicts a two humanoids in a garden, surrounded by plentiful bounty.  Many animals set the scene as well, but eyes are drawn, either by some trick of the piece or magic, to a serpent in the center, twining it's way up the female's leg.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue's eyes gleam a cold blue light from under his helm, sending a cross of radiance down upon the depiction.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter inspects for a keyhole or mechanism.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a keyhole, off to the right of center.  It seems to be ingratiated into the scene, it is a star on the horizon.  (History or Religion check for more.)  Hinges are on the left side of the door, massive iron buckles.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Mao is left scratching his head, but Dieter gets a ping, back in the recesses of his mind.  He remembers an old tale of a garden, hidden away from the world.  It was said that this garden was where the original elves came into Faerun, but they were deceived by the beings that were already present in the world.  There was something about a star leading them, and a star being the key to their salvation... but he just can't put his finger on the exact phrasing.</p>

<p>(The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.  (History checks for symbol, perception checks for the hallway.))</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ah, perfect.  For some reason I was thinking it was associated to the health amulet he has.  No worries, I gotcha now.)</p>

<p>(Religion or history, depending on which side of the coin you'd like to know about, this has a bit of both to it.  You can roll for each.)</p>

<p>Dieter keeps digging back, back, and remembers something else.  There were Naga present at that first meeting.  He remembers there was a massive battle, with the elves striving for a foothold on their new land, and the serpents trying to drive them back whence they came.  Maouelue remembers being a young boy and being told about these stories, how his people came from a land across the seas, out of time itself.  It is said that the stars hold the key to returning to that place.  But the way to travel the stars is long forgotten, lost to the ages and usurped by magic.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is nothing about the amulet that is special or that stands out.  The serpent attached is a standard symbol of the ouroboros, the central icon of the Naga.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks down at the bone key he carries.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He thinks of all the bodies to which they've lain waste. He thinks of these accursed tunnels. And poor Culver! He must have met some terrible fate by now. It is all one mystery after another...Oh the torment!</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bone gives Dieter no further insight into the mystery.  There is something, though...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Something odd about the construction.  And the material...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Maouelue: "Ugh...he does this sometimes. The wizard is unmoved to follow at this point in time. He sits down and urges Frume to do the same. They are weary."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter heads back to where their Muhlen sisters had first spotted them and tries to secure a length of rope to assist in managing the climb.</i></p>

<p>Dieter has a harder time getting to the place where the beast was.  The minions didnt have anything on them, but the boss might.  As he approaches the entrance, he sees it littered with rubble.  The entrance has collapsed.  (You might need the others help.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He gives a big groan as he makes his way back over to the rope.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Come help me over here! Back down the hole!”</p>

<p><i>He waits a few moments for a reply.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You hear Frume making his way to you after a time.  "Whassa matter, Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>I think we were hasty in one of the previous chambers. I need to ask your assistance. Come down.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"On it."  He heads to where you are.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When he sees it he sighs heavily.  Then, taking your meaning, he looks down his arm...</p><p>"Ah,  I don't know how much help I'm gonna be here, lad."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue has tagged along and offers to help.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(To move all of the rubble, we'll have to do three successful group strength checks.  Frume would normally have disadvantage, but I'll say he can just give the help action to one of the two.  DC 13)</p>

<p>(And without adv, nice!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The three haul rocks for a good few hours, finally revealing the wreck of the hallway and room the snake-man-warrior was killed in.  Most everything in here is covered in a think layer of soot.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter pokes amongst the remains, looking over the warrior's corpse for anything that might have survived the blaze.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue heads over to the alcove he didn't properly appreciate before. Was there something there?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter sees ashes and soot.  Every coffin, every clay statue, the bones of the monster they faced-off with...  ashes and soot.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue finds another idol, this one bronze.  Same design as the gold one.  There is a crack in the base of this statue, and it's drawer hangs lopsided inside.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue attempts to use his sword to wedge the drawer open.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a <i>pop</i> it tumbles out of the base, completely off it's track.  Inside is an object wrapped in a piece of parchment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The wizard gently unwraps the parchment trying not to touch the object yet.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
An ornate iron key falls out.  The handle is delicately filigreed as falling stars, the large bit end is decorated as a shining star.  On the parchment, written in flowing script, are these words:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>My dearest daughters, I had hoped you would follow in my footsteps.  Know that this path is dangerous and rife with peril.  However, once you choose it, I promise you it will not be without glorious rewards.  Find the other two statues, learn what I have to give you.  Once this is complete, find the iron door.  Use this key to start your new lives under a new banner.  May the Great Scaled One rise and live forever! -LM</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The wizard pockets the key and mutters...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"So. Close. Now."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group heads back to the rope, but considers the passageways underneath the route above for a moment. It had all happened so fast, first the ceiling, then the boosting and teleporting up. Had they missed something below?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Straight wisdom checks, or Insight if you have proficiency)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard is fairly confident that, although these caves are probably vast and they would be able to search a very long time and find many interesting things, things pertaining to their current quarry are above, not below.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>It's at times like these that Dieter is glad he brings a cool head along.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group attempts to ascend the rope.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They assist the one-handed Frume up, then Dieter helps with the metal mage's ascent, then he attempts to clamber up afterward.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stench of acid is still strong here but the clothes are in the wrong place.  Maouelue remembers going through them, as does Dieter.  They both agree that someone else has been through them recently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter goes invisible again and moves out toward the front of the group. They start back around to where they stoned the basilisks and inspect the far end of the room.</i> (r20)</p>

<p>The hallway before the group is narrow and the torchlight flickers off it menacingly.  The ceiling is ridged like the gullet of a snake.  (Perception check)</p><p></p><p>There are multiple passageways off of the hallway.  The room to the right has discarded and rotten tapestries moldering way on the floor.  Two open rooms are on the left side of the wall.  At the end of the hall, two snake-men statues stand guard over a vestibule area and a hallway that travels NE.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This hallway is trapped, something about those ridges.  Dieter can't say exactly, but those ridges don't look safe.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The wizard looks in and nods.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The Druid inspects the area for any triggers.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The cracked tiles on Roll20 are the trigger points.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Need to afk a bit)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They peer into the space on the left before the triggers.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first room on the left has rotted pillows on the floor surrounding three large stone eggs.  Tapestries that might have hung on the walls are in tatters on the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, I crashed <i>hard</i> last night!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(NP I got carried away with a bunch of stuff too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes special interest in the eggs, feeling them over with his ungloved hand.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue taps into the arcane, sensing magic within the eggs.  They are made of rough stone, but carved well without any cracks or pockmarks on the surface.  There does seem to be a thin red, sticky coating on the tops of all three.  Maouelue smells the substance.  Blood.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Dieter, burn these..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter is getting a bit weary of fanatical burning at this point, but he’s to tired to bother arguing. He sets a small flame at the base of the eggs.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Nothing happens as it's lit on fire.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue, nonplussed, leads the group back out the door and around to find another way across the trapped room.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Besides jumping over the trapped floor, there is the diagonal hallway to the S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They take the diagonal hall back into the 4-way room and look to go through the manacle room. They also want to slice all the manacles down if possible.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group travels down the length of hallway, with Maouelue and Dieter's passive perception, they catch sight of an irregularity in the floor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They check it out.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a mesh covering cleverly disguised as a false floor.  It covers a pit filled with spikes.  Bones litter the floor below.  The pit is five feet across.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oi that’s a bit of a jump!”, the Druid remarks.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can normally jump as many feet - long jump - as your strength score, so this shouldn't be tough for you.  But the overhead stone is low, so just for fun, DC 10 acrobatics check to jump over.  Please!)</p>

<p>Frume and Dieter hop over, while Maouelue checks the trajectory.  He hops, but not quite far enough.  His metal boots slip on the very edge of the pit, causing him to slip backward...</p>

<p>With a deft hand (and an <i>only</i> hand), Frume reaches out to steady the Dragon Mage, ushering him to safety. </p><p></p><p>The group continues around the path, eventually making their way past the manacles and into the hall where they could go out to the crevasse, or to the seemingly unnaturally dark room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They move left away from the crevasse.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Everyone hugs the wall and moves through the darkness.  After a few steps, everyone hears a low snarl.  No one can tell the direction the snarl is coming from.</p>

<p><i>Dieter snarls back. He’s itching for a fight by now.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

Maouelue: “Wise words. How’s your stump?”

<p>(sorry, ignore that 2. This is a home brew from beyond, so it may have some bugs. It will need a manual con save for the poison. Also, I just made up these stats based on a generic poison mechanic. lmk if you had something different in mind for it)</p>

Dieter: "These bleeding tunnels..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group moves ahead and around to the left.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This hall is familiar, although it was seen from the opposite side before.  Just as Frume is about to step on the raised floor tiles, Dieter pulls him back.</p><p>"Thank ye, lad.  Too busy looking at that."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume uses his stump to point at an intricately carved double doorway, oak with iron bandings for the hinges.  Although not quite as elaborate as the garden scene from the metal door, this is just as well made.  The scene on it depicts a ritual taking place, a naked woman is on an altar, all variety of beasts cavort in the background.  Raising a blade in the air, the priest performing the ritual looks odd.  As you all come closer, you can see his face has been seared off, the wood scorched.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter give the door a cursory yank.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It opens slightly, you hear falling metal coming from the other side.  The door is able to be opened, just catching on something now.  Beyond the small opening, the room is dark.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue moves over to take a look, checking for traps and seeing whether he can perceive anything in the room with his darkvision.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception checks, or just strength to pull open the doors.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(will pull after. just mao looking.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can see torchlight flickering off some metal inside, looks like gold from here.  It's near the floor just inside, but the crack in the door isn't too big yet.  As Maouelue pulls back, he checks the picture on the door again.  (With that perception check...) Mao notices it's odd.  Something is odd about the scene.  (Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! I've been hacking away over here and losing track of time as well.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A sudden rush comes to the wizard as he's looking at the scene play out on the wooden door facades.  Immediately, there is a great sense of danger about what the ritual represents.  He's also very sure that this isn't depicting a ritual in the traditional sense.   It's more like the priest is defending himself from the woman.  As he looks closer, Maouelue notices horns on the woman's head...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Who could this dread woman be? She looks to be a demon of the abyss as best I can tell. We need to find the third idol, and quick. Help me open this and let  us make haste!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They all work together to clear and open the door.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(If they're all working together, no check is necessary.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The doors swing wide, bringing with them a bevy of golden items.  Kettles, pots, dishware and silverware all clatter to the floor.  It is as if all of these items were piled up and shut inside hastily.  In the torchlight, a golden dais can be seen emerging from the mound.  Many more golden items are piled high on it, the dimensions are large and it basically seems like a pile of golden treasure in this room.  The dais is approximately 5ft by 10ft, placed directly in the middle of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Well well well my dear mage...what have you stumbled upon this time!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The druid riffles through the pile, seeking anything gold resembling an acorn. But no matter if not...he could always melt it...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue takes more of a loremaster's approach and begins inspecting the items for additional symbols and examining the dais.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are many pieces here to melt down if you wanted, a few pieces of tableware that could be sufficient are around, too.  (d12 for how many you find.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue sees the same thematic structure of the door on the walls of the room.  Mainly animals cavorting, then growing larger.  As the scene progresses from the front of the room to the back of the room, the animals seem to grow in sentience, walk on their hind legs.  They start slaughtering the lesser animals, until finally, on the back wall, a gilded form of a demon, two heads of simian make, with tentacles for arms, screams at the sky.  Beside him, a massive serpent is coiled around a tree that stretches from floor to ceiling, the top boughs even melding into the top stonework of the room.  To the right of the serpent, a skeleton with its musculature still attached, has the head of a dragon, the body of a humanoid, the legs of a lion, and the feet of a giant eagle.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue makes his way into the room, he bumps and shifts through the various pieces when, in an instant, the pile shifts...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A rolling pile of golden debris falls around the room.  Revealing a woman manacled to the dais.</p>

<p><i>The mage pulls out a potion of healing and begins tipping it down the lady’s throat.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's gauntleted hands touch the woman.  He tips her head back and pours the red healing liquid in her mouth.  The liquid spills out, runs onto the dais.  She feels completely limp, as if she doesn't have any muscles at all in her slim frame.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Well damn...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “There is no time! Come with me!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He leads them back over to the door with the star key.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The group is clearly beginning to suffer from their long stint underground. Maouelue is losing the thread of his righteous vigor. Dieter is aping out unwittingly. The metal mage rushes over to the door and instead the star key, twisting hard.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door swings effortlessly open.  Torchlight sputtes momentarily, but resolves on a mountain of platinum bars, all stamped with a seal of a foundry from Waterdeep.  All tallied, there are 100 bars of platinum, totalling 5,000 lbs.  A pound of platinum yields 10 coins.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A gleam pierces the armor clad mage’s eye...</i></p>

<p>Dieter is being very careful to stay back from the woman.  Maouelue searches the area, moving his hands over the bas reliefs on the walls.  He lingers a few extra moments on the triad as the centerpiece of the pictures.  The room seems a shrine of sorts.  Or perhaps, something more?  He finds no secret spaces, however.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The drawer comes out a little more.  Maouelue can see inside.  A piece of parchment lays at the bottom, and colored jewels sparkle atop it.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gauntlet is preventing Maouelue's hand from getting in.  A finger brushes against one of the jewels.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Gah...Dieter!!! come over here!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He scoffs a little at the gauntlets.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is able to remove the two items from the drawer.  A jeweled encrusted dagger with a curved blade is the first item.  When unsheathed, it is dull black.  It almost looks wet.  The page is written in a serpentine language.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(let’s pause there for tonight! ooooh exciting 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Good with me!  Fun stuff, nice playing!  Have you seen some of the crossover to the People game?  I think it'll be fun to have Maouelue or Dieter to show up one day in the Icespire game!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(yes indeed 🙂 loving it)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can I roll arcana on that dagger?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There it is!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger is coated in the blood of a higher demon from the Nine Hells.  It cannot be wiped off, nor can the dagger be destroyed unless it is consumed in the fires of the Nine Hells.  If this blade kills anything with a soul, that soul is bound to the blade.  Each soul collected gives it the ability to kill an entity of a higher plane, god or demon alike.  This would also relate to the sarrukh, who were the original serpentine race, the progenitors of all serpentine peoples.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The mechanics would work something like a percentage roll for the ability to hit a higher being.  As most gods or demons are <i>extremely</i> powerful and notoriously hard to even hit, this would effectively act as a bypass to AC, or a boost to the hit dice roll.   I have to play with it, but you get the gist!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter plunges the knife down, his hand grazes the woman's skin.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her eyes open and she looks down at the two wounds in her chest.  Blood starts pooling at the man's hands.  Black blood oozes from the cut Maouelue made, while there is a sizzling sound of frying coming from the site of the black dagger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"M...  Master?"  She calls to Dieter.  "Why?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She is pale, a ghostly white.  You'd never noticed it before, but you suppose she's looked like that from the beginning.  The color of bleached bone.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks into the eyes of the woman.  Blood stains her thin shift.  Her smile beckons him.  Just before their lips meet, Dieter pulls away, pulling the dagger from the woman's body.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She shifts her legs off of the dais.  "Is something wrong, Master?"  She frowns at you.  Coquettishly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Show me your mind.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She cocks her head, questioningly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“When you read this, what do you see?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He holds up the parchment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She cocks her head the other way, looks into Dieter's eyes.  "What do you want me to see, Master?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Enough of this!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Tell me my lady, are you alive?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash’s t the mage, they are black and red.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The mage’s eye glances quickly at the dagger, then back to the lady.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter reels a moment, then looks down at his hand. He is suddenly sickened, and pulls the dagger out, staring dumbstruck at the blade.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman looks at the Dragon Mage, peers at him as if noticing him for the first time.  Doe eyes bat at the man, then back to Dieter.  "I'm alive.  Thanks to Master."  She gets up.  She's rail thin, her hair is waist length and jet black.  It somehow conflicts heavily with her extremely pale skin.  Aside from the dread you both feel, you can't help but think she's one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Tell me, to what ends would you go for your *master*?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Looking intently at Dieter, she says, "Whatever Master wants, I will do."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Lift this altar.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks down, then at Dieter.  Her laugh is a girl's laugh, innocent.  "I can't lift that, Master.  It's too heavy for me.  Also, it is attached to the floor."  She approaches Dieter, slowly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Whatever I want...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Except what I want.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I can only do what I can do.  I can do many other things..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Show me...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She approaches closer to Dieter, smiling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She reaches out to kiss Dieter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Stay your foul advance, hag.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stops.  Looks at Dieter, pouting petulantly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You're no fun."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “You are made of death. Let us show you your final release for you need not suffer any longer.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter is caught between torment rage seduction and longing. His eyes flash color after color.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She whips her head to the mage.  "You can certainly try.  Wouldn't it be much more fun to just...  give in?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She raises her eyes, feigning being impressed.  "Lord of dragons, eh?  I've met many lords.  Not one could ever stave off my...  personality for very long."  She smiles coyly at you.  "It seems we are at a crossroads, gentlemen.  How should we proceed?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, this brings up a really intriguing thing about the image of the Dragon Mark.  How does Dieter, or if he has a conversation with Maouelue about it, the two of them interpret the symbol?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter feels the mark as a symbol of his fight between his beast and human nature. Restraint vs Desire. Since Maouelue's transition to the Dragon/Metal Mage, he is repelled in a way he hadn't been before (charisma -</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Maouelue sees only the separation of the light and dark. He sees the neverending pursuit of the draconic circle as a symbol of his oath to the vigilant watch over life and to ruthlessly pursued the forces of death. He is still learning to tell the difference and thus is a bit impetuous at times, something his counterpart might negatively interpret as being overly zealous, but that is the price he must pay for the connection to his new deity. The choice between two sides of a coin is not one without sacrifice.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So very much metaphorical, not a literal 'sign on the wall'.  More to do with their nature and relevance within the scope of their callings.  Cool!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Is that similar to how Lyz'Urgk sees the symbol, too?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Lyz'Urgk sees the symbol as the divide between his two worlds. He lived half a lifetime on the other side, now he has been here on the dragonborn side for so long, it's hard to imagine what it would be like back on the other side, but he cannot let go of the manifest destiny to do so.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(One thing I've always wanted to talk with you about, and I'm sorry we're taking up space here with it - we can do an email thread if you prefer - I always wanted to know if Lyz'Urgk gets glimpses of his past life either as flashbacks, or dreams, or even when he's very heavily influenced?  Is that why he courts the mind-altering experiences, to catch a better understanding of that 'other side'?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The bard thinks that was why he ended up in this position in the first place. He always believed there was something more than met the eye in his "original" life. He went looking for it and found that festivals and experimentation led him to some very interesting people with wild tales. He kept scratching at this itch over and over through the years until he finally met someone with just the kind of proof he had been seeking, however, he did not anticipate the manor of his attainment of this knowledge. He never <i>really</i> expected it to happen, but that was what made the search fun in a way. A sort of chicken game he could play with himself. Yet the game of chicken grew into a game of dragon. One day the witches brew on offer was the White Dragon... he took one sniff...</p><p></p><p>Now here on the other side, he seeks return. He dabbles in forces and mystery that would pull him closer to the source of these magics. If he could, he would master the gate. He would find his road to and from the other side under his control...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So it's less Quantum Leap and more Eastern religion/previous life, where he knows all that's happened on the 'other side'.  He's not burdened with jumping back and forth, but he does have memories of being the other entity."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He's not sure about the nature of it, but that now fuels his mirror pursuit on this side. Is this happening? Is it a coma? Whatever it is, it's clear it is persistent and as real as real. His questions of how far this fracture goes are never-ending. Is it two sides? Is it endlessly faceted? He doesn't know, but the world he left needs to, or rather, he needs to find an anchor in this fractured set of realities.)</p>

<p>Maouelue jumps into the pit, putting his faith to the test.  Yet even the power of Bahamut, in all of his glory, can't stop the spikes from battering him around as he hits the ground hard.  There is something he can feel...  he probably should have had more damage, but instead he's only lightly bruised.  (Take 4 points of bludgeoning damage.)</p><p></p><p>When he comes to himself and looks around, he sees four solid walls, a bunch of bones and debris, and Dieter's shovel lying on the floor of the spike pit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Oh well Nine Hells then...let's get on with it. I'm going to need to make a softer way down that all that though. Toss me my shovel!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue picks up the shovel and hurls it up toward Dieter.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter grabs it and begins shoveling dirt from the edge and tossing it down, covering up the spikes. Maouelue works in turn trying to cover up the spikes and chip away at the NE wall, building up again from there.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They do this for hours.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Here's the thing, too.  Let's say you're travelling fast on the horse, 8mph is the fastest you can do, and that's outright booking it.  The crossroads where the main trail meets up with the Phandalin trail is about 12 miles away.  They have a head start on you, too.  This could be a chase sequence that lasts a good while, if you decide to pursue.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, it will depend a lot on how things develop out there. She was moving fast)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh! hah! I thought it was the guy out back that I had bummed a smoke from. Got mixed up with the names there. Even better! lmao)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So - what's happening with Dieter and Maouelue?  They take some time and dig into the side of the pit trap...  to anywhere?  You were trying to get under the dais, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Trying to make a path over to the dais. The two are going to build a bit of a refuge down here. They plan to use the dais as an anvil and they will use the heat of the lava to provide energy for the forge. Dieter can also prep Heat Metal to help with this. He has to fight his inner battle about the aversion to metal with his desire for power and some of the spells/skills require components of metal...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(They also are going to need to build a shaft out of here, so they need to get a sense of how far below the surface they think they are at this point and how they might combine their skills to craft a sort of spiral turret back up to the surface. They may need to acquire some...meat and water.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's always the muck goblin...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They're under a pretty weighty endeavor, going to take some time to carve out the earth for the forge tunnels, making the stairway...  I think we could fast-forward with a few things.  For the most part, this area is pretty well taken care of; very few animals prowling around, they should be safe from harm.  You both had rations, and you could see what the herbalism room could yield.  Remembering back to the ladder that originally brought you down, it was a good hundred feet or so, maybe 140.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, I was thinking a fast forward would be good here. They've been staying on other people's terms for a bit now. They needed to make some sort of more permanent camp for themselves. When they found the lava, it seemed like a great place to stay warm and use the energy for crafting. There is still something of a mystery to this place, so if they can fortify it somewhat, they think it will aid in their endeavors. Dieter might be moving in and out of beast forms to help with the digging etc and they would be using their water control spells to shift the dirt around. Ideally they need to make contact with Vam and Heston once they surface.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The digging of the tunnel for the forge and setting up that area could foreseeably take a full two days.  The stairs are an interesting point of order, let me look into that a bit.  Lastly, the securing of the section could be as simple as collapsing a few tunnels or stoppering them somehow.  Depending on how much Maouelue knows, there are always portals or transportation spells or runes, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think they would probably try to collect what wood etc they can and perhaps even some doors from other spaces, also they could use some of the spare dirt to stop up some tunnels.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Someone on the Beyond chatroom said a druid could turn into a giant badger...!)</p>

page 291.  There's the Farsea Swamp right in the middle, and just to the right of that, above Wheloon, is a spot by the 'Star' sea and the Storm Horns mountains and there's the King's Forest right there, too.  Should be plausible to have a druidic enclave somewhere around there.  Plus, I think Maouelue is from Cormanthor, one of the last bastions of elves.  That's in the upper right of the 291 map section.  I'm thinking about a 'meeting' mission, I have a couple pre-set adventurer's league sessions set in Wheloon.)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I like it, still on the Sword Coast... Gonna have to look it up in the book, but should be good.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was just looking for some area that had the swampy forest in between the sea and the mountain. This one seems to have some nefarious history and large monsters including poisonous snakes, so it seemed workable)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That works.  Or the Mere of Dead Men, which is just north there, should be good to keep it in the area.  If that's what you want to do, it's pretty wide open.  I'm good with the locale being other than the Sword Coast.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You'll have a better idea of the lore and where you want to go with the story, so I'll follow your call on this.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Truthishly, I'm good with either.  The Trollbark having snakes in it does play into the theme so far, though!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Not too much of a stretch to say they are familiar with the surrounding area fairly well.  The cities of Neverwinter and Luskan for sure, along with Triboar and Longsaddle, some of the other smaller towns close by.  Might have even passed through them on their way north?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So maybe we met Briffo by the fork in the river Mirar or something like that?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We can make that work.  I think I said South from the town, then followed a river SE, which would work for that ravine in the top right box.  It's the same path as the red dotted line, but you're SW of Morgur's Mound.  But we can play it that you're E of Blackford Crossing?)</p>

<p>After the toiling work of the forge, the two men decide to take a break and discover the mysterious chasm.  As they travel through the hallway,  the rift blooms into view.  Darkness swells both above and below.  A small sliver of light can be seen far above them, below is complete blackness.  There is a small walkway that meanders both north and south, clinging precariously to what now looks like the edge of a massive stone edifice.  Bats flit about, not threatening the group.  There are some other flying animals mixed in with them, slightly larger, but nothing is posing a threat at the moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers the chasm a moment, then begins to concentrate. Dieter can an ethereal form beginning to coalesce up in the swarm of bats. After a few moments, he understands and looks to back to the mage, now fully in the midst of his ritual. He keeps an eye out for the time being while the familiar descends and binds to Maouleue.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>After an hour of this, the wizard comes to and blinks twice at the bat which then immediately zooms upward toward the light above piercing the dark.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He attends a report, telepathic or otherwise about how high it is and what lies above. Should there be any means escalating this slope, the wizard would ask to know of it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat flies... flies... flies...  At the edge of it's telepathic link, it relays to the wizard all it can see. The opening is getting closer, looks to be a scar-shaped gash in the world.  At best guess, before the bond breaks, it's maybe 200ft above the two.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue instructs the bat to fly up to the surface then come back down and report.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As it comes back into range it receives the signal and follows out the commands.  Several minutes pass as the other animals seem riled by something, they flutter upwards rapidly and perch, suspended from the ceiling, tens of feet above.  A small rumble can be heard, very faintly, to the N, and from below.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's new bat familiar returns and reports.  The cavern is extremely vast, the opening is 180ft above.  It is an entrance gouged into what seems to Maouelue as a barrow of sorts.  Ruined stone walls surround an altar or pedestal.  The room appeared to be unused for quite some time as the bat reports detritus all over.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>(Are you cool if I change some spells around assuming they've been doing some of that while building/resting the past week or so?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh yeah, you would have been able to prepare a whole new set.  Two days have passed, this is the start of the third day.  I'll get the bats-eye-view of the barrow in a sec.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kk!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
As the bat is about to take off back to it's roost, it gets the last command from Maouelue.  If a bat could roll it's eyes, this one would have done so just then.  

It makes the long flight up all the same.  As the men are getting back to the forge, the bat finds the wizard and relays the following:  
After a much more thorough search through the barrow, the bat relays the time of day is late afternoon.  Sun was streaming through whole broken sections of stone wall a human could easily fit through.  The altar in the middle of the room is ornamental, it seems to Maouelue to be an accent piece.  Lastly, the bat was able to discern an elaborate metal door he previously thought to be rough stone like the rest of the walls.  The room is 40x40.

<p><i>Maouelue understands the bat's disdain, but...that's what familiars are for to an extent...He'd give it a spectral spider as a snack a bit later...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter tugs at Maouelue's arm as they walk back toward the forge.</i></p><p>"I've got a plan...It's crazy...but it's a plan...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I'm listening..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "I'm going to have a bit of a growth spurt, or rather, I'm going to make one. Come, let us prepare for a bit of a journey. Who knows what might happen..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "That's a bit cryptic, friend..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Don't worry, I'll fill you in as we prepare."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(How much progress would you say they have made with the stairs thus far? Are they poking through the altar room yet?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I haven't quite figured out how to do the digging yet!  Technically they're under a lot of dirt and such, I figured that they wouldn't be under a river or anything crazy.  Where would you want the stairs to begin?  And, if they're digging the stairs straight up, they could still be on the Muhlen's property.  Would they dig the stairs into the cavern wall by the chasm?  Just trying to figure out the logic in this fantasy setting!! 🤣)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Mao is digging up toward the dias room and Dieter is digging down from the forge room to fill up the pit and connect with Mao’s staircase. They are first trying to make a quick way for hot items to go back and forth between rooms or a way to move the dais closer, but it sounds like the latter won’t be happening any time soon. They would be using their water and earth magics to assist in shuffling the dirt.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dinner now but i’m down for some more later!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotcha.  I was thinking the tunnel and the hallway between the two rooms could be done within those two days, no problem.  Plus getting the gold items and platinum bars moved would have taken some time.  Either way, however you want to configure your forge, you got it done in that timeframe.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Updated on Roll20, too.)</p>

<p>(back)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>As the two return to their construction, Dieter tells Maouelue about his plan and what they might want to prepare for the way. The wizard shakes his head and lets out a chortle of impressed, and a bit flabbergasted, approval.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>...dear how long had it been...? The time seemed endless in these halls with only the light from the forge and what they provided giving note. Thus the two would venture over to and from the crevasse to note the timing of the light from above, the better to track their days with.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Somehow they had come through it all unscathed, mostly, and the manual labor and reminiscence was working wonders for their camaraderie. Maouelue spent more time out of his shell lately as it was just too unwieldy and hot to wear heavy plate at the forge. Dieter was still making peace with his fraught relationship with metal. He supposed that since the lava's heat was of the earth rather than of burning woods, he was more willing to indulge.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And indulge he did. They did. They hammered away at that gold and platinum attempting all manner of tricks. Maouelue told stories about ancient folded-metal blades he had read about in the archives, while Dieter regaled the elf about water shapeshifters he knew who could cleave a shield with a thin-but-powerful stream of water. It was great to slow down and spend some time together.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>He watched the glow and heat flicker and bend in the platinum as it slowly became red, then yellow, then white, then liquified slowly at first, then all at once falling down into the semi-spherical molds. Next he started pulling them up to let them cool and settle a bit before he would finally flip the mold together and send it down one more time to remove the seam. After a few minutes, he pulls up the rig again and brings it over to the cooling pit, which they had built into the dirt covering the spike pit. His hands glow blue as he sends a ray of frost over the mold to crash the temperature. Steam spews everywhere as he does so. After a while he stops the ray and watches as the vapor begins to dissipate. With a cautious hand he reaches out to touch the mold. He opens up the box and sees three beautiful, pure new orbs, now made of the metal of his master, ready to be put into the line of vengeance.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>He would have to become it.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And so he did.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>After several hours, he had managed to make quite a few gold shuriken that he set about applying poison to. As he counted his work, he glanced over at Maouelue, who all the while had been repeating his orb processing, and now sat surrounded by nine shining platinum balls. What a sight. What a confirmation of his belief. We are the light drake, we are the dark snake.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I honestly don't want to follow that up, that was fantastic!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p><p><i>Over in the corner of the 4-way, Dieter picked up stray shuriken and stowed them in his bandolier. All of a sudden, he began tidying things up and shutting down the workshop area. Maouelue's concentration was broken by this and he started.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Oi, what's going on then?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "It is time. Time for a bit of risk...but you know what they say about that?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>That one caught the mage off guard and they each had a mighty chortle. Their bags were nearly set, the workings shut down. It was time now to be on their way.</i></p>

"Please, guard our forge and secure this area. Make yourselves at home and eat what you can find, but you know...leave some stuff for us and...gather some shit too if you can!"

"Au revoir les enfants!!"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>And with that, he leads Maouelue out toward the crevasse without a backward glance.</i></p>

Dieter: "You haven't seen impetuous yet..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Then he sinks the Staff of Baobab right down in the soil at his feet, sticking out at an angle into the rising abyss of the crevasse's center.

<p>(The largest baobab tree is located in South Africa.  Also known as the 'Muri kunguluwa', or 'tree that roars, the Sagole Baobab is over 100ft tall! [cue the music for <i>the more you know</i>!])</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter taps into a deep pool of druidic knowledge.  Warm humming stems from him and echoes around the cavern, casting harmonics everywhere.  A crescendo of sound, positive radiant energy is visible as golden and green sparkle motes in the air.  The bats take flight moments before Dieter thrusts the Baobab staff into the ground.  </p><p></p><p>At first, nothing happens.  Then, the gold and green motes seem to be sucked into the staff, giving it a glow that nearly blinds the two heroes.  Dieter yells to his friend to stand back just as roots erupt from the bottom of the staff, growing directly into the soil of the cavern wall.  Thick shoots start emanating from the staffs top, and the width of the staff starts to grow.  Second by second the staff adds more boughs.  The staff turns into a massive tree growing from the side of the cavern wall.  Vines have knotted themselves up the side of the tree to make a makeshift walkway/ladder the men can use to climb up.  With a final <i>creak</i>, the tree finishes its growth, a tuft of leaves blotting out the sunlight at the top of the rift.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two then tighten their pack straps and start to make their way up the long course of thick ivy and vines with which Dieter has surrounded the tree trunk.  It’s a tough slog, but the extra footing and holds help greatly as they ascend. A glance downward shows Quenchy sitting out by the wall of the crevasse smoking a rolled cigarette and making dismissive gestures.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Since there are the footholds, I'll say they can make it up if they're going slowly and being careful.  In the writing of the staff, the tree will stay until you dispel it, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(yeah it will stay there but only bear fruit once a week.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The Frenchmen make themselves at home, picking out areas for their work, and even dismantling the trap in the hallway so they're able to move through with ease.  The climbers hear the bats flit around them, but they do no damage as one of their members is friendly to Maouelue.

<p>Dieter knows from Maouelue there are four coming, but he doesn't know from where.  Maouelue can see one silhouette peeking through the broken stone window on the N side of the building.  Dieter knows someone is there, too, just hasn't seen them yet.</p>

<p>Dieter peeks out and almost bumps into the man peering through the broken window.  He's flanked by three more burly men, looking for other breaks or entrances into the building, all coming from the N side.  (With a 17) Dieter can also see the circle of runes tattooed on their clothing, signifying the Runemark.</p>

<p>Dieter appears in the window in front of the man, and the thug yells in fear and disbelief.  The second before Dieter stabs his eyes out and ruins this man, there is recognition there.  There is realization there.  There is disbelief there.  He barely has a moment to remember where her had heard those words before the swords enter his brain and cease his life.</p>

<p>(Need a ruling on something. Would Dieter be able to use Magic Stone on his shuriken? RAW it doesn't fly, but wanted to run it by you.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Run me through what Magic Stone does again?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>!spell magic stone</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So, it imbues a projectile, specifically referred to as a stone. Ruling would depend on whether we fudge that definition.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(by stone i mean pebble)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How much damage would the shuriken do after the Magic Stone is added?  The pebble by itself doesn't do damage, but the added magic helps it become a weapon.  I would say if this was a 1st level, it might work, but since it's a cantrip, you could potentially OP those shurikens or other projectiles.  It's a fine line, because if shurikens work, bolts and arrows would have to as well.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sun is set behind the trees in the west, the haze colors the sky red.  Matching the ground around Maouelue and Dieter.  In the distance to the north, Dieter can just make out another haze.  A cloud of dust is being kicked up.  The details are hard to see, but it is probably the posse coming.  At a glance, Dieter gives it about five minutes until they breach the barrow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter quickly checks over the bodies, looking for loot and info. Maouleue does the same in the south before they rendezvous back in the barrow.</i></p>

<p>Besides the very dirty clothes and ill-kept weapons, there is a piece of parchment crumpled up and stuffed in the man's trousers.  It reads, <i>"Be on the lookout for two men answering to the names Dieter and Maouelue.  (Descriptions follow.)  These men are bandits charged with stealing from the Runemark.  5000 gold piece ransom, dead or alive."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter takes the message and they leave the bodies. They head back into the barrow and into a corner, Dieter once again goes invisible and Maouelue throws the net over himself.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tension (strange?) mounts as the hoofbeats get closer.  It sounds like thunder, Dieter and Maouelue try to count the number and get lost in the cacophony.   Tense minutes pass.  Finally, graciously, the thunder subsides and sounds of many feet hit the ground.  This isn't just the posse, it's the cavalry.  Steps start hitting stone, and a pair of rugged, muck-trodden boots jump in through the window, swords out and at the ready.  A familiar face scans the area.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Come on now, lads...  I know you've tricks.  Tell you what, I'll put one o'these away and we can discuss terms, eh?"</p><p>Frume sheaths a rapier, but holds his Giant Slayer at the ready, in a dueling pose.</p>

Sooo, here goes.  We're business men, put simply.  We would prefer your help in our ventures.  And I'd be happy to take you to the headquarters, maybe reunite with Culver?  If either of ya is still here, there's really no way to fight yer way outta here.  Just offrin' up the olive branch first, as it is."</p><p>He waits, listening and watching.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The two remain silent. Surely this is a ruse...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks about a bit more.  Sheaths his other blade.  Makes a face as if to say, <i>well, okay</i>, and hollers back through the window.  </p><p>"Fan out you lot.  See if there's anything we missed.  And get those bodies buried.  Or burned.  I want reports from the team leaders before nightfall."</p>

<p>(Yeah, didn't think he could move without the armor attracting too much attention.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So he threw the net over himself and cast nondetection to avoid scrying)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The 15 lets him get by, if you want him to skeedaddle.   But if you want him to look out, the roll still stands, and he can stay up there.  Either way is good.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think it's more fun if he has to huddle up there and try to listen for bits of information, but let's say the roll makes it so his is well undetected up there for the time being.)</p>

<p>(Gonna be in and out here for the next bit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are more people coming and going from the room, and suspiciously the same one comes back three or four times, each time checking the altar in the middle of the room.  An hour passes with none entering.  Then two.  Finally, the suspicious man, who looks very rat-like, enters the room and ushers two others in carrying a heavy burlap sack each.  They heft them onto the altar with a sickly <i>thud</i>.  The rattish man sneers at the sacks and rubs his hands together.  Realizing the others were still in the room, he shoos them out hurriedly, and waves his hand over the doorway.  A light blue shimmer covers the doorway.  The man stops, seems pleased, does the same for the windows next.  After the room is sufficiently secured for the man, he goes back to the sacks and starts taking items out.  (Perception check for Mao, please.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pieces he sloughs out of the bag are what remains of the woman Mao had killed to the south of the barrow.  The man arranges the pieces neatly, to make a sort of makeshift person.  When complete, he looks over both shoulders and out of both windows again.  Coming back to the body, he spreads both hands wide over them.   Dark smoke curls around the man's fingers, then hands, then arms, extending down and around the pieces of the dead woman as well.  Maouelue can see the whites of his eyes, or at least his eyes have a completely white cast to them.  He's muttering now.  (Religion check for the speech, Arcana for the spell.)  The bits of pieces on the table start to shudder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is having a hard time concentrating as the words are causing a thrumming in his chest.  A dull ache starts as the words continue to wash over him.  The dark shadow smoke washes out from the man now in waves; pours over the dais and completely obscures the contents upon the altar.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the man stops chanting.  He stands there with his mouth open, eyes white, buffeted in smoke tinged purple in places.  Arc lightning races through the smoke.  Then the darkness descends.  Maouelue is completely blind to the happenings.  He puts a hand directly in front of his face and, thank the gods, he can barely make out the silhouette.  More magic, this is.  </p><p></p><p>The heavy darkness and smoke slough off like ash falling to the ground.  The man is standing before the altar, facing an abomination sitting, staring at him.  The thing has a rat face, but somewhat humanoid as well.  It has rat like appendages, a tail, but also have very human features, too.  It is a perfect blending of the two species.  The rattish man chuckles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(-3 i guess since level 5)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, it's a fifth level spell.  According to the item, I have to do a Con save at...  Did I mean the DC would go down, or up?  One second, it's dinner too...  Let me check on something, I'll be right back.  Sorry bud.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no prob! i caught that it was lvl 5 late.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(shit is getting testy i see ;P )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(aah i see i can spend multiple charges to adjust the dc to levels? so i assume each charge above 1 would add 3 dc?.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm trying to remember what I was trying to do with it.  So, if you were to use four charges, you could negate a fourth level spell if I didn't hit the DC - which is 12 as of now.  To counter a 5th, the DC is going to be 9, and it'll wipe out all four charges.  Does that sound right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(it reads to me like the 5th level is the breakpoint for adding additional dc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Adding or decreasing?  I guess we have to decide who should roll this, too.  So if you roll, I think adding is appropriate, but if I'm rolling to see if the hit goes through, it should be lowered.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(And the description says it imposes a save, so that would mean I would roll.  Cool with all of that?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So i think the default spell-save dc for that is 10 +int modifier of the caster. if i it’s a fifth level or higher, i add a charge to offset each level above 4 or potentially more i guess if i want to overcharge it?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(so i spend 2 charges to make the dc rebalance to 12?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(or i could spend 3 for 15 or 4 for 18?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think originally I was thinking it like the counterspell spell.  With a counterspell lower than than the spell casted level, there is a DC roll to have it work.  Typically 10+Int+spell level, but the person casting the counterspell would be rolling it.  I think I wrote the item a bit backwards where the caster would have to roll the DC, but the idea was to have the shield dispel four level one spells, or a level four spell, or any combination to get to the total of four, but it would have the base DC roll to have to go through as well.  The idea was that a level 8 or 9 spell would for sure go through. 1-4=DC12. 5=DC9, 6=DC6, 7=DC3. 8 & 9 go through without roll, the shield wouldn't be able to work on this high level of spell.  Also, as the Intelligence score goes up, the DC would go up too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The benefit is that you could potentially kill a fourth level spell without using a spell slot.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ok well i guess let’s roll the max!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

It shuffles down and down over a hundred feet then a scraping sound and</i> <b>thump</b> <i>as Dieter hits the ground.</i></p><p></p><p>“C’est qui la?!”, <i>a voice asks the disembodied sound.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Dieter’s shape comes back into view as he greets Quenchy and takes the cigarette being proffered.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter leads on hurriedly, Quency follows at a medium pace. The Druid comes around the corner to find Stenchy and Frenchy roasting a stray bit of fungus over a coal from the forge. They both are leaned in, wafting the fungal fumes into their eager faces. A few half drunk bottles of ale surround the scene.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks about, slightly bewildered. The two besmirled faces turn up toward him and waft a large tuft of smoke over into his face. Quenchy steps up behind him.</i></p><p></p><p>“So let’s ‘ave a look at zis mirror, non?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Frenchy & Stenchy: “Oui! Oui! Come closerre!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter looks askance at Quenchy then turns back to another mouthful of mushroom mist. This pattern seems to oddly repeat a few times, then he turns to take one more mouthful and meets his tail between his eyes, he lunges out to bite at it, but glottal laughter becomes elongated hisses as his ‘friends?’ forms stretch upward laughissing all the way up. The six yellow eyes glisten, then blink as a silver shimmer pulls into view. Shrinking back down slightly, and looking mildly less snakelike, the henchmen hold the mirror up to Dieter’s face and force him to stare into it right as the hallucination begins to fully come up.</i></p>

<p>(Yeah, the Frenchmen have some questions, and like to have a bit of fun. Chaotic good.)</p>

<p>(But I would like you to let me know what’s been going on the other side of the mirror 🙂 )</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Or, should i say, i’d like to have a peek.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hmmm...🤔  Good question...   Let me see...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mirrors surface shows Dieter, eyes wide and unfocused, yet his clarity has never been higher.  The surface of the mirror is crystal clear.  Yet, now, it starts to haze over with a sort of frosted rim, the ice crystals crackling and creeping to meet in the center.  The center focal point becomes a tunnel, the frost becomes walls akin to the ones Dieter remembers travelling in to get to this accursed underground tomb.  And with that thought, the speed of the tunnel picks up until it feels to Dieter like he is being catapulted though a cone of ice, the end getting farther and farther away.  At the point where he feels he can't go any faster, the end of the tunnel can be seen, a distant black dot on the horizon.  The speed intensifies and the dot grows to completely fill his vision...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He blinks once.  Twice.  Then he notices the stars.  He looks left and purple nebulae waft in the distance.  Enormous floating land masses dot the amorphous landscape.  Their massive bulks house stone buildings, some have trees, others have architecture Dieter has never seen nor could fathom.  In the far distance, it looks like a magic battle is raging, streaks of red, blue, and silver swirl and explode.  A gigantic leviathan swims towards the battle, silently.  Dieter's mind reels as he watches everything pass him by.  And then he realizes...  he's moving in this incredible sea...  Towards...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A small island appears close to the druid.  It's covered in lush grass and a single tree, its branches thick and full of fresh, green leaves.  He alights on it gracefully and spies a pool of water underneath the tree.  The liquid, however, is made of a silvery substance, which reflects the myriad colored lights of this place oddly.  Just as Dieter is about to reach out and touch the pool, a thought comes into his head.  It's the though of a person, featureless but bulky.  Muscled but ordinary, non-descript.  A generic henchman, Dieter thinks.  As he thinks this, the image morphs into existence right in front of him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks over the generic person, thinking, <i>"This looks an awful lot like Frenchy."</i>.  As soon as the though ends, a silvery string of liquid comes from the pool and starts to cover the entity.  The substance starts at the feet, covers the entire body, then retreats the same way it came.  As it retreats, Dieter can now see the features of Frenchy clear on this man.  Frenchy looks around, smiles at Dieter, then sits by the tree, waiting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pool bubbles slightly and the silver string comes out again, this time creating a being purely from it's essence.  This one looks of Stenchy.  A third time this silver stream comes out, a third man - Quenchy.  The three look at each other, then look to Dieter, beaming.  (What would you like to do?)</p>

<p><i>His form breaks into fractured shifts of shape, sounds pouring out at odd angles. He settles on a nine-headed serpent that begins to reach out to every face  and the spaces on either side as well. They begin to entangle the forms, all becoming silver beams of light, flowing around through the pool and back again.</i></p>

*She plunges his face into the pool and they are swept away to a tavern, or at least their field of vision is. Their bodies remain rooted in the silver strands above. They peer down at a room full of stone figures, all held in tow by two full-length portraits, incredibly lifelike, of two basilisks flanked by stone columns.*

Wenchy: “You must reap what you have sown...”

<p>The image shifts, flips upside down and it becomes a dungeon.  The sound of someone speaking a strange yet familiar language can be hear in the distance, echoing off of the stone walls.

<p>He starts pouting, "Was only doing my job.  Putting my own spin on it, but only a job just the same.  I can lead you to the lycanthropes.  If you sway them, they will turn.

<p>“Keep talking; Stay alive.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes, yes.  What do you want to know?  The Runemark," he shudders, "is a nasty man who has taken steps to take over Oakhurst.  They're been sewing seeds of discord, saying you've stolen from him.  He's reclaimed his marked coins and the silver at the Inn.  He's taken his rage out on the people of Oakhurst, they go missing day by day.  Culver was just the first.  He says you and the druid were the ones to set the snakes loose on the town, too."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Begrudgingly the henchmen agree, exchanging dark looks. Quenchy proffers a cigarette and pointedly doesn't offer any around.</i></p>

*Nods all around.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>They tidy up what there is of the forge and pack their things, taking as much of the gold and platinum as can be carried in the bags of holding and on the packs of the henchmen. Spare gear is distributed amongst the party, balancing the load and making ready for what is to come.</i></p>

<p>The dagger (not to go pass that up, sorry!) glows like a black light, a white halo surrounds is as it's removed from the dead man's head.  The halo glows bright and abates.  Whomever is holding it can feel him pulse like a heartbeat.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(lol here’s the text i have for it:

Drawing on the memory of the cyclone that tore apart your hometown along the sword coast, you have seen firsthand the power of the wind and the damage even a leaf of dunegrass can inflict at such speeds. You feel the rage of your loss mix with the memory of the storm's force then channel it into a slicing spiral coming round after 3 full spins. Hostile creatures in a 10ft radius are rent for 3d6 slicing damage. Creatures beyond 5ft must make a Dexterity save DC 13 or be knocked back 10 feet. This attack may be used again after completing a long rest.
:
We can rewrite any of that.

<p>(Oh, and do you want to do a check to see if it's a true hit or fumble?  You'd basically roll another attack roll - without targeting - and if it confirms the hit or fail, then we check the chart.  Does that make sense?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool, so that wouldn't be a fumble since the 19 would hit.  That cool?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(fumble would mean no damage and true hit is he takes the original damage roll?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just to give you an example, the fumble would have made you shift your initiative number.  The nat one doesn't hit, but rolling a hit on the confirm basically cancels the fumble chance.  If you would have missed again, its a confirmed fumble.  Same with the nat 20.)</p>

<p>The knight realizes after a step that the metal man is not with him anymore.  He does a double take and stares at Maouelue, incredulously.  He stops his mount and points at the wizard.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seeing the black bear towering next to him, where a tasty treat was there just a moment before, it literally backs into Maouelue, who <i>also</i> wasn't there before either.  (AOO from Maouelue on the dire wolf, then he'll return the attack.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Pitiful?" Maouelue can see the tears in his eyes, the trails on his face now.  "Maybe I am at that.  My father recognized only his daughters as heirs to his kingdom of knowledge.  For some reason, only they were invited to his inner circle.  It bothers me not, for they shared with me the fruits of their labors.  They let me know the dark heart of our dear, dead father.  And I would not wish my direst enemy to be aware of his inner thoughts.  To be welcomed by him was to be used by him.  His knowledge, though...  that's a different story.  You were the ones who had the key, he said you unlocked it.  You can bring about the end of all this.  If my sisters attacked you...  either you provoked them to do so.  Or the madness...  the madness has taken them completely."</p>

You can bring them back.  You can bring them <i>all</i> back!  But he said your hearts are hard, and you would fight.  We were to bring you in any way possible."  He spins the blades.  "And I intend to."</p>

<p>The veteran has splint armor that is actually very well maintained.  Standard armor, no +.  He also carried a long sword, a couple short swords, and a couple daggers, again standard.  He had two greater potions of healing and one standard potion of healing.  He also had a hand drawn map of both the barrow site, and a scrawled map of another area, this one unfamiliar to the both of you.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Deep in an inside pocket of his coat, you find two interesting items.  The first is a ring with a marvelous ruby inset.  But then you look, and it's a bright amber color.  When you look closer, swirls of yellow and flecks of black can be seen in tumult within the gem.  It looks like lava made into a gem.  (Arcana for identification, or short/long rest to attune.)  The other is a small carved mink, made from what seems to be a pliable bone-like material.  The minks eyes are very lifelike and sparkle in the dawn's light, which is just coming up over the horizon.  (Perception for your surroundings now that it's lighter outside.  Investigation on the scrimshaw mink for info on that.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue and Frenchy go through the rest of the remains grabbing what they could find. They pick up the net and some of the stray platinum balls from Maouelue's triple triumvirate. They also take a moment to pick up Dieter's spare shuriken that he hadn't had time to take.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Frenchy, I'm exhausted. We cannot go after Dieter until I recover. Let us find some cover where I can meditate. We'll use the net if we have to."

<p>It takes a bit of scouring but (with a great perception roll) Maouelue is able to spot a higher outcropping.  Unfortunately, two things might be wrong with it.  Firstly, it's across a rickety bridge.  Second, there looks to be something on the ridge already.  Other than that, there are a variety of trees around.  Not a forest, per se, but with Frenchy there, Maouelue would feel relatively safe to get his reverie in.</p>

<p>Frenchy is still there, on the lookout.  He's looking a bit hazy around the edges, though.  He says, "Faites attention. Il y a quelqu'un à la tente."  And he starts to fade more.</p>

Maouleue: “Au revoir mon copain...à la prochain...”

<p><i>Maouleue looks around for the approaching person as his fading friend recommends.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first thing you notice that he's very nimble.  He wears brown and dark green cloaks and leather, blending into the surrounding greenery.  As he gets closer Maouelue sees his lined and weary face, the face of a man that has either had too many quests or been on a very long mission for a very long time.  He strides up confidently, loosening his pack and sitting down cross-legged in front of the wizard.</p><p></p><p>"Good morn and well met, stranger.  It seems you might be in need of assistance.  Your friend has just...  vanished."  He doesn't seem particularly taken aback by this.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Would it mean anything to you if I told you I don't much know the difference anymore?"</p><p></p><p><i>He loosens a strap on his armor and takes his helmet off for the moment.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man lets out a very subdued, but somehow very grandfatherly, paternal laugh.  "Aye, aye."  He looks around the area eagle-eyed, taking everything in.  "If you need anything to eat, I'm about to restart my cookfire.  Just over the rise there."  He gets up and nods to you.  Then heads back across the river.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You can see as he crosses the basically broken bridge that you'll have to be nimble or careful to get across. The stream doesn't seem deep or dangerous, though.</p>

<p><i>He packs his things, hanging the mace from his belt, just in case...then heads off over the river. He pulls a quarterstaff from his bag to steady himself across the river. He would have to remember to thank the proprietors at Bags of Holding Inc. they sure did make good products.</i></p>

<p>Maouelue hops across the bridge pretty deftly.  Some areas creak, but nothing falls off.  Thinking on the ranger, you get a good feeling about him.  Seemed honest and soft spoken.  The scars are definitely badges of honor from battle.  He didn't seem shy about anything.  You can probably ask him more about them without offending him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hullo there! Turns out it does get a bit cold sitting out overnight in this stuff..." <i>He tugs at his plate collar.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Offer still good to take a warm up here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Pull up a stump."  He has started the kindling on fire and is starting to put larger sticks on.  His pack is open and there are utensils out, a few packages of things, and there are two small rabbits trimmed and ready to be cooked.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thanks.... Do you come from these parts Daran?  You seem well traveled."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, well," he cracks more sticks ands adds them to the burgeoning fire.  "Been here, been there.  Been living south of here for quite a number of years.  Thundertree, if you ken of it.  Most of it's overrun now.  You ever cooked coney?"  He pulls out a small cookpan.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I've mainly stayed with flora rather than fauna over the years, but those do look delectable. Thundertree you say? Sounds familiar, but I can't be sure. Do you happen to have a map you could point it out with?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Also, if you're familiar with these parts, have you seen this place?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He holds out the veteran's second map.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Im sorry, son, can't help you with that map.  Heres the one I have."  And he pulls out a fairly well taken care of and updated map of the Sword Coast North.  Thundertree is on the southern side of the Neverwinter River, just to the West of the Neverwinter Wood.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I am familiar with this area.  What are you looking for?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well.." </p><p></p><p><i>He takes another look at the pointed ears.</i></p><p></p><p>"The short of it is, my brother in arms has been taken by a monstrosity into the clutches of a thug lord of some sort. They came from the North. Have you seen any of these brigands riding about? And do you know of any stables in the area?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oakhurst is probably the best, to the north there.  But I do know the brigands you're speaking of.  A monstrosity, you say? That big iron man?  You say it took your friend?  You sure he isn't dead?  Pardon my asking, don't mean to be so forward."  He looks intense as hes asking the questions, then abashed as he realizes its about your friend.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agh...Oakhurst...where it all started. Honestly I don't know if he's dead, but they did something to stabilize him before they left. It seemed they wanted him alive for...something."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue thinks back to the mounts they left outside the manor.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Tell me, would you accompany me as a scout back toward Oakhurst? I'm sorry to be so abrupt, it's just...I fear time is not on our side. My companion and I left some horses by the old manor house the other day. Surely they've found their way back to the stables by now, but perhaps not...One way or another, I need to speak to Vam and Heston. Pray, come with me and tell me of these brigands on the way."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He roasts the rabbits, tosses them a bit, then moves one to his plate, offers you the pan.  He seems deep in thought.  After a couple bites he brings out hardtack, offers you a bit.  </p><p></p><p>"I can travel to Oakhurst, sure.  I'll tell you what I know about the brutes too.  But you can count those horses as losses.  Whole area around that old manor is home base for those brigands."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you, and I feared that might be the case. Damn...I will be loath to mention this to Vam... To be honest, I would love to get away from all this madness and go see the coast with my friend, yet...I seem pulled back, ever pulled back by these brutes. I must take this business to its resolution."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I won't rush you, you've been over kind already, but it will be good to have a companion on the road."</p>

<p>(Thanks sir!  Well check in on Dieter soon...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranger nods and finishes with his meal, deep in contemplation.  The meal ends, you both clean up and break the site down.  Daran is particular to not leave any traces of either of your presence, so he takes some extra time fixing the scene to dissuade animals or other people from trying to follow any tracks.  When he finishes, he nods to Lumao, then hefts his pack and head NW, along the bank of the stream.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It's better that we're on this side of the river, the thugs are doing random checks for groups travelling.  Since they know your face, it' probably a good idea to use something to change your appearance as much as possible.  I'm okay in the use of camouflage, but if you have any ideas, I'd suggest we try them first, maybe."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Also, if you want to track Dieter's progress, we can go that route.  I was going to wait for Mao to get to Oakhurst, if and when, to switch over.  But it's your call, sir!)</p>

<p>"That'll...  Um...  yeah.  That'll do."  Flustered a bit, the ranger remembers himself and continues, stoically, down the road.  "Now's as good a time as any to discuss the bastards over at the old mansion.  You start, maybe I can fill in the gaps."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well...  <i>Ahem</i>, well now, let's see...  They came around pretty quickly only a few days ago.  They stopped by Oakhurst then set up camp at the mansion same day.  Their numbers have been growing every day.  Seems like something new comes into the camp at an hourly pace, I don't know where they're getting their supply of followers from.   Wherever it is, the well is deep, apparently.  Plus, I hear tell of some extremely strange... misfits in the camp.  Were-folk, mages, some even suggest arch-mages, if you can believe that.  Could have sworn I saw a Red Wizard of Thay go into the main box they have up on the hill.  Use that as the inner sanctum, I s'pose.  It's been covered over by now with tents and canopies and the like.  It's either a small festival, or a large traders outpost, depending on what you're more familiar with.  My fear is that they'll start to overrun Oakhurst, but they seem to be leaving it alone for the time being.  You say you think that's where they took your friend?"</p>

<p>The first thing Dieter does is try to use his powers to turn into an animal.  He focuses...  and it's strange. Normally he can feel the warp and weave of the natural magic around him.  Now, he just feels the cold emptiness of dank, damp air.  He shivers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Shit. Shit shit shit! What am I going to do. Where the hell is Maouelue?... Shit. What a mess back there. And the henchmen! Uuuuugh. The hallucination, the battle, now this? Dear me...no magic...what is this foul darkness. After so long underground, a breath of light and air and trees....but now this. Sigh. Time to get down to it Dieter. We've got to figure a way out of this mess. Yes. Yes we do.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter quickly shuts his eyes, but leaves one half cracked open. He lies there trying to get his bearings without being noticed awake.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter blinks several times as his vision comes to. He takes in the carving main's appearance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume stares back at you, whittling but not watching what he is doing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A pall permeates Dieter's face. His core seems to turn to an anvil. There's no avoiding this now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"So we meet again."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Was wondering when you'd be waking, laddie.  Howse the body?  Anything broken?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Does <i>spirit</i> count?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He frowns, shrugs, thinks.  "No.  I suppose you thought you'd win that fight.  Hells be true, I thought you would as well.  Came through everything else.  Was hoping to have this conversation with the both of you boys, too, but here we are.  Don't think of it as a knock on your talents, lad.  That magus friend of yourn is...  he's a wily one!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume stops carving, stands and stows the knife and wood.  He squats on his haunches next to you, like he's ready for a quiet conversation.   He motions to the shackles.  "May I?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks at him cautiously, questioningly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Just what is your role in all this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles.  "At the moment?  Just trying to get these off'n ye."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter nods in assent</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man smiles, reaches into his mouth, scratching the inside of his cheek with a thumb.  He pulls out a small jagged metal bit, and proceeds to unlock Dieter's bonds.  Once they're off, he sets them quietly on the floor, with a finger pressed against his lips in a, <i>Shhh</i> motion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The continuously re-bewildered druid sets his bare feet down silently on the cold hard ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So, when you boys didn't come quietly, the boss...  he didn't like that very much.  Sent me to keep old Culver company here.  He's been unconscious for awhile now, nothing I can do to wake him.  Funny thing about these old places," he steps to a dark corner of the cell.  He studies it a moment, then kicks out with a dirty boot.  A small section of the wall moves in, a flicker of light can be seen below.  "Secrets abound."  He smiles again at you. </p><p></p><p>"Here's the thing.  There's going to be a guard coming down the way in a few.  They check up on us, but not always consistently.  My guess, if we wait for the next pass, then leave right after, we should get a good head start, eh?"</p><p></p><p>"Plus...  leaves us time to catch up."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye. But...how do I know I can trust you? You say 'The Boss' like a joiner. Pardon my wariness, but...as you can imagine..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"...my instinct to trust is a bit...riven."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"To be expected, to be expected for sure.  And you can't trust me.  Shouldn't trust me, I should say.  I don't work at causes, but I 'join' where the money is.  Or power.  Truthfully," he leans in, "I'm in it for the loot, lad!  I'd rather rob a thousand houses, crawl through a million forgotten dungeons, if I can find a lost artifact or ancient text.  Not that I can use any of that shite.  But they do fetch a pretty sum, to the right buyers."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"In an effort to be a bit more trustworthy, I should say <i>that's</i> the real reason I was down in those caves.  I'd been looking for that tomb for some time, now.  Got what we could, but I didn't find all of what the boss was after.  He's pissed about that, too.  Oh well.   What are ye gonna do, am I right?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Mercenaries...<i>Fight for a cause, but don't die for it...</i> That's how the saying goes, right?," He considers a moment. "Well, I'm no stranger to a bit of loot lust either, but I won't forsake my companions." His eyes turn to Culver. "We must do something about him. What's his part in all this. That's where it all started for Maouelue and me. I would see our rescue completed if such a cause be just."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks over at the lump on the bed.  He sucks his teeth, considering.  "The old man has taken a beating, that's for sure.  But don't you worry yourself about it, he wasn't taken on your account.  Word around the water barrel is that he owed the boss some money, decided to renege on his side of the bargain.  Him meeting you boys was incidental at best.  The boss decided to use his disappearance to lure you both, that's about all.  He'll come around soon, hopefully.  You good with leaving him here if we have to?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter agonizes over this a moment. "I suppose we've gotten in enough trouble on his account already. Aye, we'll leave him if needs be. But, it sounds like this Boss has a comeuppance in his future...I'll make sure of that."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume shrugs and sits back down on his dingy cot.  The mildew smell is quite strong and he coughs, spits into an empty corner of the room.  "So, did you find out more about that bastard Muhlen?  Any more tricks up his sleeve in that goblin infested hovel he called a vault?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"More than a few tricks indeed. I'm not sure if we found more of his after you...did you run or were you taken?...I suppose it matters little at this point. We forged a bit of our own fortune down there, then sought sanctuary above. Only to find...well, I guess you know that part now."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I have a question though...what in the bloody hells happened to my power down here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah, right.  To be true, I was...  recalled.  Had to leave you boys, didn't want to, but when you're compelled...  Nothing much you can do, eh?  As for the magics down here.  We're in some sort of prison complex.  It's pretty vast, but it has a lot of secrets, as I showed you there."  Points at the exit.  "Well, it seems that this prison was set up for spell casters and magic users of all types.  My guess, we're in an anti-magic shell.  Or maybe there's a mythallar somewhere around, but you best pray that's not the case!  We'll all get blown to smithereens if that thing goes wonky!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You say <i>recalled</i>...<i>compelled</i>...By what means? I'd rather not fall into any unavoidable traps on account of...whatever mechanism that is if you take my meaning."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He scratches his stubble.  "Let's just say...  the boss keeps a close grasp on what's dearest to me.  Sometimes I find it hard to say no, if you catch my drift.  He's a magic user, he can speak to me whenever he wants.  So, yeah, anyone with me would be at danger from him scrying or spying or whatever the Hells he does.  We can split this place and then part ways, if you're happier with that.  I just thought...  well.  I thought I at least owed you a conversation before I took off, if that makes sense.  No honor among thieves, as it were, but...  just seemed the right thing to do.  You and your mage friend are good people.  Owed you as much."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Understood. I suppose we'll cross that chasm when we come to it. Let's keep an ear for the guard and get ready to make our escape."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye." His look bores into Dieter, trying to gain some insight into his bearing.  After a few moments, he says, "One last thing.  Did you happen to find anything about a red crystal, 'bout yea big?"  He holds up his fist.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for a bit, be back soon!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Can’t recall seeing anything like that...Mind’s a bit hazy though, i suppose.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
He looks deep into your eyes.  After an uncomfortably long time, metal clanks down the hallway outside of the cell.  A humanoid comes into view, he's armored in a variety of garments: a plate helm that doesn't fit, a studded leather cuirass, dark metal pattens, and a kilt-like chain skirt/pant.  The man walks up to the bars, looks through.  After a few moments, apparently satisfied, they nod and walk back down the hall, out of sight.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Now?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume gets up, waits at the barred window for a beat.  "Can't hear or see 'em, let's go."  He heads to the corner, pushes the moveable wall, and, little by little, an opening appears.  Torchlight flickers on a wooden ladder leaning against a wall.  Looking down the opening, it's only about an eight foot drop.  Frume offers for Dieter to go first.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sure, what the hell."</p><p>He squeezes in and slides down.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a rather tight fit, and when Dieter gets to the bottom, the tunnel that stretches before him is only five feet tall.  They'll both have to hunch while they're walking.   A lit torch is illuminating the hall as well as a intersection opening to the left and right 10-15 feet ahead.  (Roll20 is live!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The dilapidated Druid moves to and peeks around the corners.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another hallway.  Going left there's an opening to t he right, opposite on the right side.  The hall looks like it was carved hurriedly with shoddy tools; there are gashes and marks on the walls like blade cuts.  The floor is loose, dried clay.  Walking normally, Dieter and Frume slip on the scree and are probably going to be fighting with their footing all the way through.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They slyly slink...left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another long hallway ending in what looks like a mold-infested wall.  Two openings are on the left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It is also getting dim down the hallways, now.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of light farther in the tunnels.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to move back and take the torch from the wall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The torch comes off easily, and you sense that it is magically lit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Sensing the magic in the torch, Dieter looks for any loose pebbles on the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How many do you want?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(3 to start)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter spies a few pebbles which would work well with his plans. (😁)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He...tries his stony cantrip.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>Dieter rubs his temples, each of which just felt a short sharp shock. “Well, these will come in handy at least. Might need to wait a bit longer before trying that again. And surely I shouldn’t go all firestarter anytime soon.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"We need to get us some weaponry.  Who knows what's down here.  I've heard some strange stories."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Do you know where they took our things?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, back at the head of that hall.  We might be able to find a way up, but it might be better to beg off that stuff.  You have anything you can't part with in your pack?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...a great. many. things.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But let us not needlessly throw ourselves into the lions den. I’ll search with you down here for some means to recover what was stolen.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye.  Lets make our way...  west.  Should be that way, might be able to find a way up.  Still think the best way out is through these catacombs."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Frume. Let us continue on cautiously. Stand back and if I am apprehended, you flee.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pushes up to the next corner and peeks around.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Like hell I will.  No one gets outta here alive on their own.  Least that's what I heard.  Nothing down here we can't handle, right?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Right. Let’s do this.” Dieter stops himself a moment. “You think there’s equipment in the catacombs?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I think there might be.  Could be rusted all to shite, but it'll be better than anything we got at the moment."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the pair peer left, they see a wall at the end of a very short hall.  (Perception check, please!  Also, afk for kiddos bedtimes.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool. me too soon.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter senses that there's something off about the wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks for a non-magical stone to throw at it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter tosses a rock at the wall...  and it passes through.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Sheeeiiiiiit. Let’s go!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You might be too excited about this, let me head in first.  If there is someone over there, they might recognize me."  He pushes by and steps through the barrier.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Now what is this guy up to?...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume picks his head back through. </p><p>"You're...  You're gonna wanna see this.  Put something over your nose, first, though."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter finds two lesser pebbles with which to snuff his snout, then follows Frume.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Great visual!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What in the buddy Bahamut is this!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You walk into a nightmare.  Bloody implements are hanging on the wall and strewn about tables.  Blood is staining the walls and floor, some dried, some still very wet.  A trail is coming from a wooden door in the N wall.  On the table against the W wall, a dissected body is displayed.  Parts of the man's body and sections of skin have been completely removed.  (Perception check or Investigation if you want something specific.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter walks over to the body and tries to remember the rituals depicted in the vault. Was this akin to any of them? Was there a pattern to this...vivisection? <i>And just what kind of implements do we have here?</i></p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume...do you know about any of this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I knew they were doing experiments down here, but I just thought it was of the arcane persuasion.  Trying to break the anti-magic barrier, that sort of thing.  This..."  He looks like he's going to be sick.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks over the body.  It does look familiar to what you've seen before in the vault, more depraved though.  Not a specific pattern that he can tell.  There are all sorts of torture, butchering, and slicing equipment.  If you wanted to grab something as a weapon, you'll have a selection to choose from.  (Investigation check for weaponry.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Guess we'll have to do this with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You find 3 rusted daggers, caked in blood.  You also find one <i>very</i> sharp sickle.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Guess these'll have to do." He takes a sickle and a dagger and hands the other two to Frume.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Been a while since I used one of these, but...it's just like riding a dolphin."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume also finds a rusted dagger and a makeshift club.</p><p>"Thank ye, friend.  Ne'er had a chance to ride a dolphin.  Gods willing, I'll be able to try when I get back to the sea!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah the sea...Someday Frume. And I haven't forgotten about our promise either..." He looks meaningfully at the crippled man and then blushes at handing him two daggers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well anyway...you can throw them too...Never can have...enough...daggers."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You notice as you hand him the daggers...   his has both of his hands.</p><p>"Aye, true!"  He flips the two with both hands, then pockets them.  He's got the dagger in his left hand, the club in his right.  "To the door, then?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter blinks in amazement. "Well...I guess...now I know why I forgot! What in the nine– How?!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"How, what?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A javelin emerges from the floor and spears the thief in the foot.  He hops through the door, slips on more blood on the floor, and falls prone.  In front of a pile of dead bodies, all in various states of decay.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are two alternative exits to this room, wooden doors the same as the one Frume just went through.  Both are closed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You ok?”, Dieter asks as he gingerly steps over the trap and peers around the room, instinctively turning left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Sure, I'll be okay.  What the fuck is this?!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>“I’m glad Maouelue isn’t here to see this...”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are many species and types of bodies in the pile.  As Dieter takes a closer look, he realizes that these bodies are missing skin and other parts as well.  There is a table in the far NW corner of the room.  Things are growing from several dishes and bowls.  The smell is awful; gag-inducing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter reluctantly takes a closer look at the table, holding his breath best he can.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>At another time, Dieter would normally have spent hours pouring over the contents of this table.  It looks like experiments are being done with bodily fluids and different funguses and molds.  (Insight or Investigation for more.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Whomever put this together was trying to grow certain foods and cultures from mixing bodily fluids with blood and water.  A couple are doing okay, but the rest have gone into putrescence.</p>

<p>"No.  No idea what that is.  Want me to try to pick it out?"  He waggles a dagger.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm... let's test it out first before you lose that hand again. Dieter goes to grab a bit of something from the pile and throws it at the mark."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>That really hits Frume's funny bone and he starts giggling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What would you like to throw at the gem?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(A stray bit of body part from the pile)</p>

<p>(Ew.  And okay!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter grabs a spare foot, it <i>pops</i> off with a <i>squelch</i>.  He tosses the foot at the door.  It hits the gem.  A gross splotch is left on the gem and the door.</p>

<p>"Hmm...well I didn't really expect that to work." Dieter takes a Magic Stone and throws it at the gem.</p>

<p>"Frume, can you see what that was?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He heads back, brings Dieter his stone seconds later.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How strange. Here, go watch again while I throw."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The pair make to do just that.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stone hits the gem square on, it disappears.  The <i>clack</i> comes from the other room again. </p><p>"Shite, it just appeared out of nowhere!  That's amazing!"  He brings Dieter back his stone again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ok one more time. Stand back and see where it comes from."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Dieter slightly inserts his dagger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger slides off the gem to the edge where it meets the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, bewildered, tries at the handle to open the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You disappear and reappear in the middle of the butcher room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"..."  Frume stares at you, eyebrows raised.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well would you look at that! Maybe do try and pull that gem Frume. We could use something like that surely, if it will come out that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"On it!"  Frume sticks the dagger in the edge and pries.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah.  This is sticking more than I thought.  You wanna give it a go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sure thing. Let's see how sharp this sickle is. Maybe if we each take a side..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The two each take a blade and begin worrying away at the facets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with adv!)</p>

<p>(gross)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yikes!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume kicks the door in frustration.  He disappears and reappears in the butcher room.  Dieter hears a muffled, "Fuck!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah the hell with it. Let's just move on." They head North, it being the leftmost remaining route.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens with a squeak and squeal.  The musty room is filled with sacks, crates, and a few small barrels.  One is leaking in the back of the room, a puddle pooling beneath it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They two give the provisions(?) a once-over.</p>

<p>Most of the bags are beans or grains, their freshness is in question.  Plus, all of the foodstuffs in here have been around the ill-smelling table maybe too long.  Dieter finds some jerky that might be okay.  Just as he turns to give some to Frume, he hears a skittering from the ceiling...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume wipes the last few spiders away from himself and Dieter, and with a deft swipe of his dagger and stamp of his boot, the swarm is no more.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What's the chance that's the worst living thing we see down here?"</p>

<p>(afk a bit.)</p>

<p>Dieter checks the far wall of the corridor for any more shenanigans.</p>

<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't tell if there are any more shenanigans or not.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gives it up and head back south to the other hallway.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Now just what do we have here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, brother, been overly busy today.  Trying to cram all my honey-do stuff into one day!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries man. I was out most of the day anyway.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter moves from the pantry and through the rooms to one of the main halls, Frume follows, giving a longing look at the gem-door.  Dieter moves to the end of the hall.  There the hall turns left, ending ten feet away with a door on the N end.  Several holes are cut into the clay wall.  Inset in the holes are several skulls, lit candles in the center.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Before the left turn, the N wall is covered with green mold, almost like algae.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(where are those rolls when i’m pulling a dope magical gem out of the wall eh? 😆)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll try it again, I'm sure!  Not to be too big of a buzzkill, but I'm going to call it a night, sir.  I'll be back at it asap tomorrow.  Sorry Russ.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(me too dude! fancy dinner with the fam tonight. hope your weekend is good!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no apologies!!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Dieter braves the muck, wipes the slime away from a revealed iron door.  There are strange runes on it, one of which he can read.  It says: *column*.  The door is either stuck or locked.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength or slight of hand check to try and open the door!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume comes over to help. He places a dagger at where he believes the hinges to be, working the corner while Dieter tries again.  (Another, with advantage.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Thanks Frume.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dagger slips, the door creaks a bit.  But it remains shut.  "For the love of all that's holy, why are the doors down here impossible to get through?  It's almost like they don't want anything moving around down here, eh?"  He gives Dieter a dark look.</p><p>"Fuck it, lets try this."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door hits a low note, <i>bong</i>, but does not yield.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Worth a shot, I guess.  Looks like there's a door at the end of the hall."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm... Maybe we’ll find a means of opening it elsewhere.”</p><p>Dieter inspects the door for a locking mechanism.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is feeling exceptionally mediocre today.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Apparently so is Frume!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two look over the door.  Is doesn't have a keyhole, however there is a gem inset in the center.  This one is a dull brown.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“How’s that loot lust of your doing there eh Frume? Wanna give this one a go together?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, always a lustful man, Dieter, don't ever think otherwise!  We breaking down the door or trying to remove the gem?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The gem friend. The gem.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with adv!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gem <i>pop</i> comes out in Dieter's hand.  The door <i>creaks</i> open.  The light shines on an unadorned room.  Rough clay all over, but there are a few piles of dust or ash on the ground.  In the middle of the room stands a stone column.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Crap, I should have had you do a Constitution save when you did your last Arcana check, but we'll say you passed, that was my fault.  Anything magic related down here will have that save attached, at least for the moment.  If you want to check on the gems properties, Arcana check, then a Con save.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Damn, well... okay then!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gem is imbued heavily with conjuration magic.  When inset into a wooden object like a door or a chest, it acts as a magical lock of sorts.  When the person trying to unlock fails their check, the wooden object grows a mouth with sharp teeth and attacks said person.  To set it into a wooden object takes an arcana check DC 13, with subsequent tries going up by DC 1.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I suppose we should inspect this here pedestal, eh?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter beckons Frume over to the stone structure. He kneels down and looks around it’s base and searches for any markings that might betray its secrets.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Intelligence and history checks, please!  Also, throw a perception with adv on there too, for fun!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume enter the cubic room, the torchlight illuminating further in.  There is a wooden door at the E end of the N wall.  The dust doesn't stir much as they walk about.  The column is made of stone, not clay.  All four sides have fine ornamentation on them, intricate writing seems to scroll within the ornamentation.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have a keen sense that I’m being really obtuse about this obelisk.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter has never seen anything quite like this, nor has Frume.  You both get the feeling, looking over the script, that not many alive have ever seen anything like this, either.  As you pour over the intricate tracing, Frume pokes Dieter on the shoulder and says, "Look at that!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
On the north wall, script comes into view, burning red-orange against the dirty brown clay.  It is graciously in common, and it reads:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>You can kiss me, but never on my cheek</i></p><p><i>You can see me face to face, but never shall we meet</i></p><p><i>We look alike, but not the same</i></p><p><i>When I go away, it is not I to blame</i></p><p><i>In water, glass, or steel, we can touch but never feel</i></p><p><i>We were born on the same day; all the same habits, act the same way</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You are my reflection.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On the closest side towards Dieter, the stone turns to liquid, then resolves to a mirror sheen.  First, Dieter can see his own reflection.  Then, the image shimmers and a woman is standing there.  She is human, average height, into her later years.   Her graying brunette hair is held back by a kerchief, and the clothes she wears are vibrant and heavily patterned.  She smiles.  Then a kindly voice enters your head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You may ask me any one question."  She waits expectantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“How is my destiny intertwined with these dark serpents, a shadow of the light cast by my miraculous companion?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman cocks her head.  Her eyes sparkle in the torchlight, which seems to not only illuminate the room you're in, but hers as well.  "There are many roads you may travel, however each will lead you to your dark serpents.  The World Devourer waits for you and your companions.  The shadows are not the opposite to Bahamut's Chosen, but an aspect of the Great Dragon's duality, Tiamat.  While the races of elves stem from the various gods, all serpent races, including the Ancients, stem from the Great World Serpent.  At this time, there are those who are trying to open a rift in the material plane for the Great World Serpent.  Yet, there are those who are twisting their minds in order to bring Bahamut's nemesis to Faerun.  If this happens, all may be lost."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles kindly at you.  "Do not lose hope, dear Druid.  You may not have the strength now.  Follow your heart and trust in your friends.  The road will lead you to where you need to go.  Be sure you're learning to be ready for the battle when the time comes."  Smiling, she fades into Dieter's reflection.  Then the stone façade returns to the surface, and the words disappear.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That was a really good question!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(great answer!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stares transfixed at the spot where his oracle has just disappeared, his mind transfixed on what he has just heard. He stares, motionless, ruminating, stoic.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What happened there?  You see something I'm missing?"  Frume in going all over the column, unable to understand why Dieter's been staring at it intently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter’s attention is wrested from the column by Frume’s voice. </p><p>“Whoowha???”</p><p>“Oh! Frume. Ahhh, yes um. There was a...sort of vision? I can’t explain. Anyway, it won’t do to dally here. Onward my good man.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That's okay, that's just fine.  Didn't want you completely disappearing on me.  Hey, whatdya say we go try that blue gem again?  If we need to get your gear, we're kinda going the wrong way."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I suppose it can't hurt, now we've figured out how to pry them out. Let's do it!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leads back to the gemmed door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>"Agh! This fucking thing! Frume, I don't know if it's going to budge..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume gets an crazy look in his eye.  He looks to the door.  Then to the noxious table.  Then back to the door.  He gets down on his hands and knees, checking the bottom of the door.  He says, "Wanna try something?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I checked. It was the same. 1/400 chance for that shit)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's like when you guys were pummeling the knight!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I can see you're not going to let this go easily. Aye, I'll follow your lead."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Well now I have to know)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Standing and heading toward the pile of bodies.  He tears some strips of cloth and brings them to the table, ushering Dieter over.  "If this doesn't work, or it takes too long, we'll search more."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(looks like the first several were no adv, then Mao took two adv at the end that also missed.)</p>

<p>The first few, nothing happens.   On the fourth, a small explosion lights up the table and the smell of ozone fills the air.  Frume smiles at Dieter.  "That's a winner!  Remember that one."  He continues.  Another does something similar.  Unfortunately, his enthusiasm reaches a bit too far.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He reaches a small red vial, the contents are thick and it looks almost like a solid mass instead of a liquid.  Frume drops the flaming bit of cloth into it.  Nothing happens for a second, two... three.   Then, the inside of the vial turns a bright orange, the vial balloons out...</p>

<p>(<i>muffled</i>) "You good to go?  Let's get it!"  Frume runs at the flaming door.  He hits the door with his shoulder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter follows, with a shake of the head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door comes down and Frume pats down his clothes, checking for fire.  "Fun, right?!"  He smiles widely at Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall is short and it turns sharply to the right.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You know what?!? That <i>was</i> fucking fun!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter likes this bit of reckless indifference. It's an interesting change of pace.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ha!"  He thumps you on the shoulder, then heads to the break in the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The subsequent hallway goes north and south.  The light illuminates the whole length.  There's a dead-end to the N, to the S it takes a sharp turn E.  There, unfortunately, is a heavy stench of urine that is starting to be covered by the smoke stench.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I can't fucking breathe in here for much longer. Let's hurry!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter runs to the South corner.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another short hall.  A hall to the N, then another at the far end to the S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter scopes out both turns.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short hallway on the N ends in a locked door.  The door to the S button-hooks around to head W.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(Work is kicking my ass right now, dude, sorry.  Gonna be a bit until I can rev it up here.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How do you want to take care of this door?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Same. we can catch up later.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, I've always wanted to kick down a door. You with me?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Let's do this, boyo!"</p><p>(Strength check with adv, or attack roll - if you have unarmed attack - with adv.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door buckles, shakes.  Dust rains down from the cavern hall ceiling and comes back at the two from the shaking door.  A crack sounds, but the door still stands strong in the doorway.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is moaning coming from beyond the door.  Sounds like a handful of entities, all groaning loudly and approaching.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Uhhh, on second though, maybe we try the other door?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, shaking his head at the door.  "Woulda been interesting if we knocked it down in one, eh?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye. Aye aye aye."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Why do I get the feeling you're enjoying this?" <i>He winks.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Could be me smile!" He smiles wide.  "Ahoy, lets see what else is gonna try and kill us down here!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed. Maybe we listen a bit more closely <i>prior</i> to kicking this one in, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, then shakes his head, chuckling.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leans his ear up to the seam in the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh dieter...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seems fine.  You should totally go in.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ok, this one's all clear. Let's do this!!!"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door is unlocked and swings wildly in, banging against the interior wall.  The room is dimly lit by a small forge sitting against the north wall.   Various packs and belongings are scattered here and there, giving this room a look of being lived in, opposed to some of the other rooms you've visited.  There is a large tapestry on the E wall.  (Religion check for more info.)  There is also a ladder in the NW corner leading to a wooden trapdoor.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(HA!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume is still very interested in whatever is behind you guys, so he is wandering off back down the corridor.  Dieter senses a whirring, whoosing sound, but can't seem to see where the sound is coming from.  Doesn't seem like this room would have a draft...</p><p></p><p>As Dieter looks at the tapestry further, it is beautifully made, but very old.  Soot stains the majority of the fabric, but a simple decoration of a castle on a hill with various villagers and houses dotting the landscape can be seen.  Dieter looks closer, though, and through the simple weavings, he can see something else unfolding.  He puts his face almost right against it, staining his nose black with soot.  This might be the <i>back</i> of the original tapestry...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(There really is magic in the rolls)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes note of the whirring but decides to take a look at the back of the tapestry first.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The druid throws the tapestry off of the wooden pegs holding it to the wall.  It falls in the middle of the floor.  There a picture unfurls.  A five-headed dragon stands on a hillside, overlooking rows and rows of soldiers.  The five heads each unleash their own special attack, and the soldiers are decimated under the might of this beast.  There is a scroll in the bottom of the tapestry, apparently setting the title of the piece: "*The Victory of Our Dragon Queen*".

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume hears the commotion and comes in, looking at the picture as well.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(work meeting)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Good lord!" He notices Frume entering, "Have you ever seen anything like <i>this?</i>"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Never.  Looks like a good knit, too.  Must be one of the Cult pieces, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I suppose so." Dieter takes a few minutes to commit the scene to memory, then goes in search of the noise, pressing his ears to the various wall whence the whirring is emanating.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks, searches, strains to hear and see what he was missing initially.  Nothing shows.  The small, hot fire crackles near the forge, that's all he hears now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Still bewildered, he begins knocking on the walls to try an hear any echoes beyond.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No sounds emanate from the knocking, the walls are solid clay.  Scree falls here and there, but other than that, nothing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(can i see the room in r20 pls?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, shit, my bad!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(NP!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Frustrated at his seeming hallucination, Dieter makes his way to the SW door and checks for signs of traps mechanisms before checking whether it is locked.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation for traps and locked-ness... 😀)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter, wary of these doors down here, searches for traps.  Finding none, he checks the door.  It turns easily in his hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank goodness." He enters cautiously and casts glances around.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short hall awaits beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He proceeds to the end and looks...left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>...and again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid looks upon the end of the hall to a storage area, of sorts.  An armor stand is visible, holding a fine chain shirt.  There is a weapon rack attached to the E wall with two gleaming short swords.  A long sword is leaning against the NE corner.  At the base of the armor stand, a small chest is opened, revealing two standard potions of healing, and a third potion which Dieter is unable to identify on sight.</p><p>(I couldn't get the items set up visually in Roll20, sorry!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, ever cautious in this never-ending maze, peers over the items as it it's too good to be true. He looks again for any traplike shennanigans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>No traps, everything looks legit.  Nothing yells out at being magical at first glance, but everything looks very well made.  Maybe even elven in make.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Maouelue would love to see these...I hope he gets to some day..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I was looking at some rules for checking potions.  If you want to test it by tasting a bit, you would have to do a Constitution save, or your could roll an Arcana check as well, depending on whether or not you think it would hurt you.  Depending on the type or poison it could be, the effect would probably be minimal if you were just to take a droplet to see what the effect of the potion is.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Thinking fondly of his friend and the forge they made together, he swallows his misgivings about the metal armor in deference to practicality, then dons the rest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I would try arcana first)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The chain shirt is exceptionally lightweight, fitting well to you.  The weapons seem light in your grip as well.  </p><p>(Roll arcana - at your own risk!   Mwahahaha!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Eh Frume...I know my stuff is up there, but do you think we had better clear this place before heading up? You never know what we might find and that just might be the advantage we need up there, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"True, true.  But who knows how big this place is.  It's all over the place, I can't get a read on it.  Not to mention whoever was dissecting those bodies.  Rather not meet them without a bunch o' fighters at my back, I'll tell you true."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He tries to close the door behind them and find a way to secure it from opening. He considers a moment, then reaches in his pocket and pulls out the latent gem. He smirks, then pushes it into the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agreed. Go on and head up and I'll be right behind you."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods to you, looking determined.  He climbs the ladder, each rung clasp echoing raspingly in the clay room.  As he gets to the hatch, he whispers down to Dieter, "There's a catch here, I'm going to slide it quiet and try to peek through."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Without any sounds, even to Dieter, Frume undoes the clasp and opens the hatch.  Then, quicker than a snake bite, he clambers up through the opening and opens the trapdoor completely.  He offers you a hand.  "We gotta be quick about this.  No one's here but there's bound to be someone soon.  Les go!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter follows quickly, astounded at the silent lightning that is his companion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two enter in a roughly 30x30ft room, cluttered with desks and parchment.  A table is pushed into a corner, where four chairs surround it, a card game interrupted lay on it's top.  No one is in the room, but you both can hear sounds of talking coming from down a hallway to the <s>N</s>  South.  You both come up into what is essentially the center of the room.  (I don't really have this up in Roll20, did you want a board or is theatre of the mind okay?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Heading into a meeting Back in an hour or so)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Theatre of the mind is just fine! Can we distinguish the emotional candor of the voices in conversation?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yeah, I think so.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room also has a hallway going off to the W.   There are no sounds coming from that direction.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check to see if you can hear what they're saying.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(the ones Dieter! The ones!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They seem pretty garbled.  Unlike the underground rooms, these up here are all made of fitted stone, and poorly kept, so the echoes are furious.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I think one of 'em is saying something about a lost prisoner...  Shite.  I think we make a run for it, but we need to be stealthy."  He looks around the room.  "Where in the bloody blazes did they put that trunk?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter examines the parchment and takes the playing cards for himself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is looking for names, places, plans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They're a deck of Three Dragon Ante, a very popular game in Faerun.  The parchment are various edicts and dictates about the law and how the questioning of prisoners should go.   Several are signed, they all look relatively official.  They've been strewn about the room, though, as if they're been gone over for information.  (Investigation if you want more info.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to perceive who is signing off on these papers and who might be the authorities involved, as well as whether the Runemark are for or against whomever has signed these.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The papers look old, and it's almost as if they've been magically protected against age, too.  The dates on some of them are outrageous, nowhere near where Dieter knows the date to be.  (Dieter sees the year 3129 on them, with a strange month tag that he doesn't recognize.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is nothing within the papers that he recognizes as belonging to the Runemark.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Do you keep looking through the papers?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes 3 of the more interesting looking ones and begins to usher Frume out of the room quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(North or West?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They move West out of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the duo heads out of the room, moving down the westward corridor, the sounds of talking start getting louder from the northern passage.  The two exit just as a pair of voices enter the room behind them.  (Stealth checks, with advantage, please!)</p>

<p>"Oughta get hazard pay for this shit, can't believe they're having us mount to look for these assholes.  They're probably still in the fucking castle.  I say, take every floor, search every room.  But no, no one listens to me."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oy, aren't you the one that said they're probably in the catacombs?  You're fulla horseshit!  I think Rock is right, they're way off'a the grounds.  Someone helped 'em escape, probably someone close to that Bander guy, and they're making a run for it.  Gonna be their surprise, nowhere to run to, aye?"  </p><p></p><p>The first voice is gruff, hardened, frustrated.  A man looking to take out some repressed emotions in the form of extreme physical violence.  The other has a rather rat-like sound to his voice.  Nasally, with words spat quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two sound like they're rummaging around the room for something.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume head further down the hall, into an area with rows of cell doors.  Some are bars on hinges where you can see into the cell.  Others are like the door Dieter and Frume were behind, heavy oak with banded iron bracings.  The latter are at the end of the hallway.  The very last one is standing ajar, an arm flopped outside of the opening.  As Dieter takes a few steps, Frume catches his arm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cell door to their immediate right is lined with several chests.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gives a muffled start and looks at where Frume is beckoning. He checks the door as if to open it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens...  (Sleight of hand check, let's see if it squeaks 😟)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter takes his time, knowing the two thugs are basically right behind them.  Ever so slowly, he checks the handle.  It comes open with no sound, no resistance.  He looks around and with the caution born of survival, and the patience born of being a child of nature, he opens the door enough to let both he and Frume in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are three chests in this cell, the first one is wide open, nothing of importance is inside.  The second and third are against the remaining walls, both are closed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Frume, stay by the door for now and keep watch while I check these out.”, Dieter whispers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He makes his way over.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods, draws his sword, and waits by the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first closed chest is unlocked and un-trapped.  There Dieter finds his clothes and incidentals.  The second chest is locked.  (Sleight of hand or strength to break it.  Or, if you have another idea...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sizes up the chest and tests it’s weight.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Does incidentals mean everything or just some of his stuff like all but weapons/armor in this context?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Everything but the weapons.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tumbler gets caught.  Dieter tugs on the barb he's using and the lock <i>clicks</i> very audibly.  Luckily, or maybe not, at the same exact time, a bellow comes from the other room...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Who the FUCK took my cards!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter slips his ring of invisibility on quickly and feels a deep precious relief come over him. He raises a shushing finger to Frume as he does so and beckons him to stand back against the wall as out of sight as possible.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter vanishes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

As the men breach the hall, you see a lumbering, ugly brute with a heavily pock-marked face and baggy clothes trudge out in front of a weaselly looking guy that has missed a good number of meals.  He's gaunt and his eyes have a seriously haunted look.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a worry, just saw it.)</p><p>The guy had one gold, five silver, and a note of writ, mentioning a ransom for the escaped druid, Dieter Deleter.  The seal of the Runemark is marked in wax at the bottom of the parchment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter’s teeth look a bit like fangs as he snarls at the ransom note. He gives the thief’s corpse a swift kick before leading Frume down the hall. He takes the lead an invisibly scouts out the upcoming turns, listening for any significant movement or sound.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair move W, throwing the door at the end wide.  It was their former cell, the remains of what they could only assume is Culver is strewn about the room.  There is now a hole in the wall where the two escaped from.  The room is covered in blood, but something else seems off, too.  (Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room starts to spin as the sight of all that blood (and lack of flesh) begins to disgust Dieter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Suppressing a retch, the disoriented Druid turns and beckons onward.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We need to get out of this hell trap. I need air. Did they say this was a castle? perhaps we can find a parapet and repel. Anything to get out of here!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Les go back to the main room.  Thought I saw some doors in there.  There might be something across from that chest cell, too.  See about those areas first, I'll be on the lookout for any ladders up."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Upon further investigation, across from the chest cell, a smaller room had the look of just a standard cell.  Hidden in the shadows, a decrepit door stands.  The original room (with the tables and card game) has a door to the S, where you had heard the voices coming from.  (Investigation check for more!)</p>

<p>(Kiddo bedtime! Might be some gift wrapping too. not sure. i’ll keep you posted!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Dieter continues down the hall to meet Frume and look for additional ways of passage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a door across from the cell with the chests in it, a door in the S wall of the trap door room.  (Retconned the direction of that one because of the new map!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They check the door across from the cell, listening first for sounds behind it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to open the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens to a dark room.  Sparse cobwebs linger in the corners, moldy and tattered hempen bags are scattered on the floor, mostly congregating in the corners.  There is another wooden door on the W side of the room.</p>

<p>Dieter casts a quick glance at the bags to determine what they might be containing, but mostly keeps moving forward.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On a quick glance, there's nothing there.  Rotted grains, decrepit cloth.  The next door is slightly ajar.  It opens into a strange storage room.  It's narrow and ends in bags of grain piled up to the ceiling.  There is light coming through several open places throughout the makeshift wall, leading you both to believe there is something beyond it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They begin baling the bags over to block up the door they just came in as they try to reveal what’s behind.</p>

<p>It takes a couple hours, the bags are heavier than they look, and the two are tired.  After the majority of them are moved off to the side, an alcove is presented.  Fresher (although not by much) bags and crates of vegetables and barley are packed into the W side of the room.  A handful of dried herbs hangs from the ceiling.  A barrel sits off to the side, a symbol of a boar's head emblazoned on it.  (Perception check, please, for general info.  Investigation for anything specific.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Also, there is a door leading to the E.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter considers the Boar’s Head symbol. Had he seen it somewhere before? He can’t be sure.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The two eat a bit of the fresh food while they take a moment to consider.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(History check on the symbol.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter opens the boar barrel, he happens upon salted pork jerky.  This also seems fairly fresh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There also seems to be a slight breeze coming through the room.  The source might be coming from behind the crates and barrels.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>While chewing on a guilty pleasure, Dieter tries to sniff out the source of the draft. He beckons to Frume to help him move the obstructions about to aid in the search.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Looks like this is from the Dwarves!  Could be them up at Mithril Hall, or maybe up north in Ten-Towns, up Icewind Dale way.  Either way, the Dwarves know their salted meats!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The heavy items are moved out of the way, and a trap door 3ft by 3ft, is at the base of the wall.  It's locked with a hefty padlock.  A dank, fetid smell comes through the rotted knots.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter checks the sturdiness of the door itself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He plies at the wood of the trap door with the edge of a shortsword.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The whole thing just crumbles, the wood is wet and pills in Dieter's hands.  As the wood falls away, red streaks are left on Dieter's fingers.  A furnace blast of decay and iron hit both noses, and bile immediately rises in their throats.  (Con save, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh not this again....)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume turns quickly so the pork doesn't come up, but Dieter... isn't so lucky.  The corner gets splashes while the smell seems to permeate everything.   A snarl comes from the newly uncovered tunnel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Putting the kids to bed, be back in just a few!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume bends down to see if his torch can light up the length of the tunnel at all.  It only goes a few feet in.  Dried blood cakes the inside, giving the tunnel the look like the interior of some infernal beast.  Frume has a kerchief pulled over his nose and mouth, offers another to Dieter.  </p><p>"What say we board this damned portal up?"  A moaning comes from the other end in an ominous answer.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What new devilry...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pulls his blades out and lets out a low growl.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Whoa, friend."  Frume starts looking for things to block up the tunnel.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He starts pulling grain bags over, slowly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gathers himself and moves a barrel over on top of the trap.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume nods and helps him.  "That should do it.  I think."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He runs over to the door and rushes through it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hallway ends 20ft ahead, a small entrance to another room is on the right.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(passed out hard last night. sry)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They bolt down the hallway away from the wretched retch and inspect the next room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a worry at all, gotta enjoy that no-kid time!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh man. kids. dear me. I am actually back in Mich now.)</p>

<p>The duo heads down the hall, Frume pausing to slam the door closed.  He rushes after Dieter, the two turn the corner and are greeted with a very interesting sight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mucus looks sickly, and the body is sluggish, the eye stalks droop heavily.  It does not respond to your noise from the hallway.   The shell on it's back shimmers a rainbow of colors, even in the dim light of the room.  Even in it's somewhat emaciated condition, it's huge, and takes up the entire room.  Beyond it, the two adventurers can see another makeshift wall of grain bags.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter studies the <i>beast's</i> form. He draws on his acute learnings of history and nature and melds them with his natural affinity to the amphibious. He feels something wild within him growing. What is the name of this new wonder of the shell?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check, with advantage!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter taps into his druidic nature and comes up with the name "Flail Snail".  He knows that this creature can emit very bright light from it's shell, which it isn't doing at the moment.  The shell also emits an anti-magic shield, and some also have a bit of wild magic imbued.  Some sects of paladins strictly use shields made from the flail snail's shell because of the anti-magic properties it exhibits.  Dieter also gets a sense that this snail might be sick, all the signs point to either extreme exhaustion or illness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check too, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Damn, it's not a beast after all 😛 )</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter feels the pain of this sick snail and searches the room for signs of manipulation and abuse of the poor being.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He assumes a preliminary bedside manner and attempts to show the snail he means no harm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Medicine check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Frume, go grab some of those herbs if you can. This one looks like as much of a captive as us."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks at Dieter.  "You, uh...  You want me to go back... in there?"  He points to the room down the hallway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Now that Frume mentions it, you do hear a kind of scratching coming from down that hallway.  Like nails on wood...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agh, I guess not." He turns back to the sickly snail and tries to catch its eyes, raising his hands in a non-threatening way. He pulls out his water skin and sprays a few ounces down in front of the snail's visage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A little pool of water forms at he snails front, a couple long, droopy stalks find their way to it and lap it up greedily.  A small bit of color comes into the grey flesh of the animal, giving Dieter some hope for it's survival.  From the druid's cursory medical check of the creature, the biggest takeaway is that the animal hasn't eaten for quite some time.  And, upon further inspection of the shell, it feels to Dieter as if some of the anti-magic power is being siphoned off somehow.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter pulls out a hunk of snake meat from his pack that he hopes has survived well enough for his purpose. He sets it in front of the snail and backs away deferentially.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Guard the rear," Dieter whispers to Frume.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The meat looks blackened and partially rotted.  The snails eye stalks shoot up, stare at the meat, then a maw opens wide from the bottom of the greyish flesh, a wide toothless mouth, and it scarfs the morsel in one bite.  Eyes stalks close as it devours the decaying snake meat.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sounds of heavy pawing at the door behind you can be heard.  The low moan that was heard from the darkened tunnel starts again from the previous room now.  Frume takes a few more steps towards it to investigate.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The smell becomes too much for him and he retreats.  "I'm going to get these bags down, help me cover this doorway with them, aye?"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks back and sees his struggling companion. He takes his remaining three hunks of snake meat and lays them out for the snail before joining and helping barricade the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check, please!)</p>

<p>“With our powers combined!....urrrgggghhhh...”</p>

<p>These bags are much heavier.  Either that, or you guys are much more tired than you realized.  (Contested check coming up.  Dieter and Frume roll  D20 each.  The thing on the other side of the door is going to roll a d20-5.  This is going to be how long it will take the boys to block up the hall vs. the thing to break down it's door.)</p>

<p>The men get to work hauling bag after bag.  Sweat pours from their faces.  Occasionally an eye stalk pokes out and relieves them of their perspiration.  Another bag goes on the top, the clawing from the other side starts to beat frantically on the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall is blocked about three-quarters of the way up.  Dieter hauls another bag over, Frume is just about to heave it atop the pile when <i>bang</i>!  The two hear the door flung wide and crash against the stone wall, probably shattering it to pieces.  A lumbering, unnatural sound comes down the hall.  Frume just finishes throwing the last bag up when a pale appendage comes over the top of the barrier, searching frantically.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stench that follows is beyond nauseating, and the snail even seems affected.  It starts to batter against the bags in front of it, knocking a few out of the way, opening that clearance a bit more.  The appendage that hangs over the barrier is...  odd.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It looks as if...  it was a leg.  But that can't be right, because the end is clearly an arm.  A hand?  But the hand looks odd, too.  Like it has too many digits...</p>

<p>The snail nuzzles you, searching for more food, while at the same time moving out of the room for fear of the fire.  The room beyond the former grain-bag wall is covered in straw, or maybe what remains of an old rug.  There is a lazy brazier in the corner, not doing much to give out heat or warmth.  Standard wooden doors are to the W and S.</p>

<p>Immediately you see color return to the snails greyish flesh.  It turns an amber color, blood can be seen coursing through it's vessels below the skin.  The shell regains more luster, too, and a dim light, getting brighter by the second, starts emanating from it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 updated!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The W door opens to another corridor, roughly 35ft long.  It ends in stone double doors to the S, while a wooden door on the W side looks slightly ajar.  The S door opens to another storage room, various sundry items and foodstuff abound.  More of the pork jerky and cheese can be found here, along with eggs, herbs, and a strange box with what looks to be a stylized fish on it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hey Shelli, you still hungry girl?” He proffers the inventory to his new pet, then inspects one of the fish boxes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The box is very well sealed, and a very familiar, fishy aroma greets Dieter when he opens it.  A waxed cloth encloses some of the finest black caviar Dieter has ever seen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm, this might trade for a fair penny, if we ever get the chance...” He stows the caviar then eats a few hunks of cheese, forgoing the pork and looking for some mint to settle his stomach.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Not only do you find some hanging peppermint and spearmint, you also find basil, oregano, and a plethora of fancier herbs for cooking and herbalism.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh these will make the road life much more bearable.” He stows a healthy amount then beckons for the duo to follow him down to the stone doors.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume finds a pack and starts stuffing food in, particularly the cheese and pork.  He follows with a piece of jerky hanging out of his mouth.  He tosses a very moldy cheese wheel towards Shelli, who snatches it out of the air.  Her shell shimmers gratefully.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is snarling coming from behind the stone doors.  Ripping and tearing of something as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, there is a MASSIVE <b><i>BOOM</i></b>!  Stone, grain, dust, and other debris rockets out from the door at the N end of the hall, smashing into the wall opposite the door.  An inhuman <i>screech</i> is heard from the former room as flames pour out of the former doorway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter and Frume turn to look as a charred abomination clambers out through the newly made hole in the wall.  It walks like a crab or scorpion, smaller appendages in the front, getting bigger the farther up the body they go.  Six appendages in all.  They seem to be an amalgamation of leg and arm bones, ending in a perverse mashup of feet, hands, and claws.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The body, despite being charred, is the torso of a human, but everything is stitched together backwards.  The shoulders and head are at an angle as to let the thing crawl, but still be able to look around at its environment.  Like a scorpion mixed with a centaur, the thing rears up on its hind legs when it sees you and the snail.  To more appendages flick out from it's back, a mixture between a tentacle and a scorpions stinging tail.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What now Frume?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter enters the side room, another strange sight greets him.  For no apparent reason, there is a goblin tent set up in here.  A small, greasy fire is burnt into the stone floor.  Three barrels of foul smelling liquid are seeping through broken slats in the corner, dampening the floor.  Inside the tent, three dead goblins can be seen.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume just stares at Dieter, as if to say, 'What the hell is this?'</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Not sparing a moment, Dieter says, “Help me with these Barrels!” He has Frume help him move the barrels into their growing booby trap in front of the dragon door.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to determine what is in the barrels. “Back up Frume”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume backs up.  Dieter prepares, but just as he's about to make a move, the double doors start opening towards the heroes...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter taps his ring, instinctively going invisible.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume flops into the other room.  The snail stays put.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter gets busy uncorking a barrel and seeing whether he can tip it over in time.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The doors swing wide open, banging against the stone walls.  A regal man steps in.  Coarse, curly black hair sits atop a stern looking, young man's face.  Even though he is young, his face is battle-scarred; a long, thin wound, partially healed, carved his face from left temple to right jaw.   He's covered in plate mail that looked hale but battered.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He strides into the room as if he owns the air people breath.  His frown looks ironed on, as if its a permanent fixture.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon cocks it's head at you at the mention of Tiamat.</p>

<p>Dieter produces a flame in one hand and holds a serpent amulet in the other, then slowly walks out to face the black dragon.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter lowers his head but keeps his eyes on the drake.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The over-large maw stretches all the way down either side of the black dragon's face, giving it a macabre, menacing look.  The black eyes, pupil-less, stare straight at the druid.  It smacks its mouth, acid spittle dripping from it's teeth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

He sets his flame in the center of the neckband and begins to ritually line up his vials of poison around the outside of the makeshift shrine. He finishes with the Neogi venom at the 12 O’clock position in front of the amulet. </p><p>“Tiamat, take these gifts that our minds might connect.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(Well, at least the religion wasn't a one...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(level up at next LR yeah?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon pops its front paws on the closest upright barrel.  He begins sniffing the air, completely ignoring the makeshift altar.  The huge maw opens, the tongue lolls out.  Dieter notices, now, that this is very close to a baby dragon, maybe a few years old at most.  And it is extremely hungry.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tongue laps at the sharp teeth, the two men back away.  Shelli shakes in her shell.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon turns its head to the remnants of the fire in the other room.  Sniffs again. Then pops down from the barrel and trundles over to Shelli's former prison and starts snacking on what's left of the pantry items.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, slightly embarrassed considering, picks up the altar pieces and stows them back in their various locations. He takes a moment to spread the contents of one of his poison vials over his armaments.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Twas a good idea, lad.  Maybe we can take a look in the cave before we bust outta this place?"</p><p>(Probably best.  If you were to level up and update now, you'd get all your spell slots and such back.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Question about the bladestaff. Could we play it like each end of it is a light weapon allowing for two handed fighting like mechanics for it, so instead of attacking with two short swords, i just take an attack action with one end, then a bonus action to attack with the second? Limit both to 1-handed damage?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I dig that, sure!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Nice, feels good to make that change at the level up too, like he has mastered the weapon that much more.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>Combat ended.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The experience with the dragon and Shelli have struck a chord deep in the spirit of the developing Druid. He feels the pull back to the coast embodied by Shelli, whose amphibious nature and steadfast presence remind him of the sea and of home. The dragon, the fleeting, yet acquiescent power, the stoic serpentine stature, key him into the deep mystery at play here and the opaque stakes, the depths of which he is sure he has not even begun to plumb. </p><p></p><p>Dieter leads away into a quiet corner and beckons the Bandersnatch to stand guard a moment while he recovers himself and meditates on all that is new.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Sure, no problem lad."  Frume splits his attention between the seemingly illusory goblin tent and the hallway from whence the small battalion just came.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok, I'm all leveled. This does not count as a long rest though, right?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Short rest if you're just meditating.  If you want to take a long rest, you should probably find more stable ground.  The Captain's probably not knocked out for long...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ok, but from leveling i'd at least get my spell slots and hp right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was thinking about prepping new spells too, but think that might only be after LR as well. I do at least get one new  spell to prepare, but just wanted your ruling on how that works here)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Usually you can't use any of the new spell slots or spells unless you prepare them and have the spell slots for them.  It's getting on a pretty full day.  Let's see if you, Frume, and Shelli can get to a 'save point'!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool cool)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's move! I need more time to do this properly. Frume, take the rearguard, Shelli, well...follow as quickly as you can!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leads them through the room of Dragon carnage and stops short to take a closer look at the place now the dragon has moved on.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Everyone, get in here and let's bar these doors."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume begins to do so, ushering Shelli in as fast as they both can.  Besides the skeleton-cide that happened in here, it looks like it was once nicely furnished as a trophy room.  Various stuffed animal heads, including a small red dragon, are mounted on the stone walls.  Interesting creatures abound in here.  You also take notice, through every room you've passed, you haven't seen any windows...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around for any valuables, then asks of Frume, "Just how did you disappear with the Captain? And what of that strange Goblin hut?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a door, stone, on the E wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter meanders over to the Red Dragon head to give it a thorough inspection.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ah, now that's a story!  So, I'm running into the room, really I was falling into it, trying to get away from whatever was coming through those doors.  Thought I would hide in the goblin's tent and surprise him, like.  Only, when I take a step in, there are these stairs, and everything is pitch black.   I stumble a bit, fall, catch meself on the dirt floor, a few feet down.  I'm totally thrown but I have enough wits about me to get the hell outta the way, in case something else comes clambering down like I did.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, as I move off the dirt path, I see the oval shapes all around me.  Black upon black they were, almost couldn't make 'em out.  My torch went kaput, so I had to feel my way around.  These things were hot to the touch, so I put two an two together, came up with four, and realized they were dragons eggs!  Then this big bloke comes in, searching for something.  Snuck up and gave him a whack on the back o' the noggin.  Then I ran out as fast as I could.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If you ask me, looks like they're making a dragon army with all those eggs in there.  Or feeding something humongous."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"By the breath of the sea mother...A DRAGON ARMY?!?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"This bears careful thought. Did you get a sense of...how heavy those eggs are? How long do you think he'll be out?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, maybe?  Who knows what these... crazies do or why.  I bet he'll be out for a few minutes, but frankly he could be coming too any minute.  The door's shut, if we can wedge it closed somehow, that should buy us some more time."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed...though I hate to think what foul deeds might become of those dragon eggs one way or another. Do we not have a responsibility to do something about it?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Though, might better to get out alive and maybe do aught on the other side of the wall as well..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter grimaces, but steels his mind. "Right. We flee East."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Before he turns, he looks back to the Red Dragon and considers taking a little memento.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume takes an antelope head from the wall and wedges it under the doors.  The scraping grates on the ear.</p><p>The mounted dragon head is bulky and, in all sense of taste and class, abhorrent.  The look it's giving, the size of it, the actual taxidermy...  Not well done at all.  But it could work as a memento or a specific buyer might pay a good sum for it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Dude, I am in seventh heaven right now!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, is looking at the horns and teeth, presumably the eyes have been replaced by something or other as surely a Dragons real eyes would not sustain in this way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door E grates on the stone floor, crumbling pebbles acting as pumice to the floor beneath.  The heroes look through and see a long room, bedecked with gadrooned columns and torches lit irregularly on the rough stone walls.  There is an air to this room, a somber, creepy feel.  A breeze blows through, rustling tapestries attached to several columns.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The floor also tracks downward toward the end of the hall approximately 60 feet away, dropping in all about 15 feet.  There are three doors on that end of the room, one on each side, W, S, and E.  There is something carved in them, but you can't tell from this vantage point.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ffs)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>From the far end of the room, Dieter can tell there are four separate banners.  All different colors, they look to have different insignias on them as well.  The doors, although still hard to make out, have an odd type of lock on them, which is what is carved into them.  There are no handles on the W and S doors, but the door to the E has one.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You also hear the wind stir, but you can't make out what's creating the draft.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Taking what he can of the dragon bone, Dieter hurries the crew into the East room. Ever cautious, they close the large doors behind them again. He works with Frume to closer identify the insignias and lock patterns on each door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You take the mounted dragon apart?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Trying to pry out its teeth and horns as crafting components.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Athletics check with adv, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter starts dissecting this mounted dragon, it falls apart in his hands.  The skin, brittle as paper, flakes away.  The musculature wasn't treated properly and turns to dust in his hands.  The teeth and horns, however, and decently intact.  You get two horns and ten teeth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(History check on the tapestries, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(thaaaaanks 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
You both bounce ideas off each other on what they could be.  The first one is black and gold, a picture of a wyvern or dragon falling:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The second is a beautiful dark purple, on which a set of eyes is emblazoned on a crest above talons:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The third is a blackish purple background, the foreground is a strange diamond crest.  It looks to be made of gold, with silver waves cresting the middle:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The last is a pure black tapestry, and it is threadbare and hanging on by a prayer.  The image can just be seen:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first is a symbol of the Zhentarim, a cabal of merchants, thugs, and assassins bent on cornering every market and town for themselves.  They have no scruples and care for nothing save money and power.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The second is the mark of the Cult of the Dragon.  There are many off-shoots, but this is  the main symbol created by lich Sammaster.  Their ultimate goal is to raise the dragons and dragon-kin to their rightful place in the world - above all.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The third is the mark of the Arcane Brotherhood.  Frume pipes in about this one, as he mentions he has dealings with the city of Luskan<s>, or which it is now known as, the City of Anarchy.</s>  They are a fringe society, but what they lack in notoriety, they make up for in pure ambition and magical prowess.  There are a set number of seats in the brotherhood, one has to die in order for another to be raised into the sect.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The last...  eludes even Frume.  He scratches his head.  "Looks like a death cult of some kind, but I'm damned if I know.  You feel that chill, by the way?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Follow the air. It will guide us out." <i>I hope...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter goes over to the East door and checks the handle while feeling around for the draft.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Feeling a draconic irony overcome him, Dieter hands Frume a bottle of Gold Dragon Ale and pulls one for himself as well. His third and final, he proffers to Shelli, seeking any sign of interest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Animal handling check!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The snail sticks her... nose (?) up at the brew, but Frume taps your bottle and says, "Fucking cheers to that!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
***Gold Draconic Ale**: Infused with cinnamon, little gold flakes can be seen floating within. Causes the drinker to belch small harmless flames for the next 5 minutes.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The E door is closed, but not locked.  The carvings read oddly, a few have been scratched away.  Frume meanders to the S door, burping small flames every now and again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Whatcha make of these carvings, Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stows the third ale, knowing what it does now, he hopes to see the look on Maouelue's face when he gets the chance to quaff this last.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He traipses over to Frume all the while keeping a nose out for the source of the wind.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Druid's eyes flick back and forth over the distressed carvings.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The breeze feels like it's coming from different directions at different times.  (Arcana check for the doors, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's tough because these look like they're legible, but the language is either very ancient, or set up to trick your eyes when you read it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter turns back to his search for the wind. He produces a flame to help guide him in the direction of the draft, watching as the flames are pushed this way and that.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The flame in his hand flutters, dives.  Corrects and becomes still.  Then violently wavers again.  It becomes like bubbling, boiling water.  It grows in size, double, now treble the size it once was.  In shadows above, gliding down, is a shadow spectre, wrapped in grey smoke and floating down directly at the druid!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter releases the flame and steps backward, assessing his options.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>With what time he has, he takes note of the spectre’s shape and form trying to perceive its alignment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's ethereal, swathed in smoke.  It is not being aggressive, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Greetings, dark spirit.” Dieter coughs in his best abyssal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The smoke roils and expands.  A hoarse scream comes from the center of the entity.  Dieter looks and Frume and the spectre are holding their heads in their hands.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume hits the floor, a line of blood running from his nose.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The spectre stays hovering, but is backed further away.  There is a soft blue light illuminating the smoke now.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Dieter slowly approaches the light making no vocalization. He walks steadily and reaches out for the blue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is feeling the dark pull. The thirst for knowledge. The thirst for the power to drive his own destiny....</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes a deep breath of smoke.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid is engulfed in smoke.  Frume gasps and reaches out for his friend, but his hand encloses on nothing.  Dieter is transformed...  And the two beings.  Vanish.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few minutes later, Daran creeps back into the area looking frustrated.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(making sure he hasn’t taken it)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Who hasn't taken it?  Daran?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What did you spy there Daran.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah in case i needed to make us invisible etc)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Not a damn thing.  Which worries me."  To the woman, "Who is after you?  Or is it the letter someone is after?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Messenger: "I don't know why someone would be after me!  The letter was given to me with a dire urgency to deliver it.  I've been making haste to Oakhurst.  The bolt hit me and I fell off my horse, who bolted farther down the path.  It was rented, so it'll probably go back to it's owner, I don't suppose I'll be able to even retrieve my gear less I go back."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We will deliver this message with all haste. May we lead the pursuant away.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, we must hurry!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"If we leave this woman, and she doesn't have the letter, she dies.  Do you have anything that can help her?  Or magics that can spirit her away?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue places the amulet of health around the maid’s neck and whispers a prayer to the lord to send forth its healing and to aid them in their mission.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods, following Ouelue's direction.  He roots around in his pack, pulls out a strip of leather that could be a belt or strap.  "Put this in your mouth and bite down," he tells her.  She does, and he grips the bolt.  "Why don't you try to pull that out one more time, this time you'll have my help."  He braces the leg and the woman, motioning Ouelue to remove the barb.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Strength check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>This time Ouelue lends all her empathy into feeling how the bolt is lodged and reaches out with her feelings...</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The bolt pops out of the messengers leg, she moans, but Daran quickly staunches the blood and casts:

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
"Sorry, lady.  Not much extra help, I'm afraid, but enough to get you on your feet."  He pulls out a cloak from his pack, drapes it around the woman, and helps her up.  Lastly, as he walks the group to the main road, he casts:

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"This should work, but let us keep to the edge of the road, and let us move quickly."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ready to run?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let’s make for Oakhurst in a hurry.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Might be ridiculous, but let's say you're about three hours out.  Let's both roll 3 stealth checks - remember to add the +10.  At DC 10 there'll be something bad, but other than that, all three should be able to get there fine.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(FYI, for that format, !c stealth -rr 3 -dc 10)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crew travels lightly, all three moving with amazing stealth and precision.  Only once does Daran think he sees something following them, and backtracks a bit.  After a few minutes, he rejoins the group and pushes them on.  As the clouds open up, the trio emerges from a group of trees and the village of Oakhurst is visible on the horizon.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to pause there for tonight, but I have to work tomorrow so I can pick it up early.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(good good! good to be back in full swing!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hell yes!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A wave of emotion overcomes Ouelue as (s)he sees the town for the first time in what feels like weeks underground. Anxious to determine Dieter’s dilemma, (s)he pushes forth with haste.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage enters a surreal town, one he knows and doesn't at the same time.  Burned buildings, few children and families are in the streets.  The dead lay with rain pattering them, only those they left behind to carry them to their graves.  </p><p></p><p>There are a handful of buildings still upright and somewhat intact.  The inn, the tavern, a few homes, Vam's ranch...   These all, at least from first glance, seem okay.  The three enter the crossroads proper and scan in all directions.  The Runemark's men didn't raze everything, but the town is still only a shell of it's former self.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stands speechless. he cannot fathom what kind of evil soul would do such a thing. </p><p>“Those bastards will pay for this...”</p><p>He leads the group onward toward the ranch, hoping to get a word in with Vam and potentially Heston before heading into the wreckage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group turns W, led by Ouelue, they see a rough-and-tumble man, early thirties, dusty blonde hair tied into a tight bun at the back of his head, stubble darkening his weather-beaten face.  He leads a big brown gelding NW through the town.  He wears normal rancher's clothes, but atop them, a set of emerald green snakeskin chaps, a vest, and bracers indicate him as Heston, the tailor/ranch-hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"That's a fine bit of snakeskin work there...Reminds me of a time I loaned out summat around these parts."</p><p>Ouelue winks meaningfully at Heston. </p><p>"I have desire to speak to Vam and hit Leatherworker as well. We bring tidings from the Manor..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranch-hand gives the group a strange, suspicious look.  "Aye, head over yon.  Vam's a bit beat up, but he'll see ya.  It's a bad time to be comin' inta town, just to let y'all know.  I'd be headin' out as soon as ye can.  Just some friendly advice."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman grabs Ouelue by the arm.  "Excuse me, miss.  If I could have that letter back, I must deliver it right away to the Pig and Falcon.  I appreciate all your help.  Both of you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes yes, of course. Here. And your pin as well.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue waits for her to be out of earshot, then leans closer to Heston.</p><p>He whispers,</p><p>“It is I...Maouelue. Prithee take a moment to catch me up with Vam...”</p><p>“...That is some fine snakeskin.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman nods, and leaves quickly, making for the tavern.  Looking at it, the Pig and Falcon is surprisingly free of burn marks...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston does a double take, then looks Ouelue deep in her eyes.  He drops the reins and gives the mage a hug, saying, "I knew you'd come back.  The others...  they said you'd abandoned us to those monsters, but Vam and I...  we'd knew you'd come back to help."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue surprises himself with how passionately he returns the embrace. He is <i>relieved</i> to be back in town regardless of its state. There are wrongs here that need to be righted, and the return of Heston to his sight instills the vigor of purpose and direction.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, this is my good man Heston. He is a friend in this. Come Heston, let us away with these tidings to Vam.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A bit embarrassed, but still a hardened cattle-man, breaks away from Maouelue/Ouelue.  He then shakes the rangers hand.  Surprisingly it is Daran that looks sheepish.  (Insight check for more!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man reminds Daran of someone. Mao can tell that, but no more.</p><p>Heston motions the two to follow him.  They head towards the ranch, which looks very battered indeed.  The farmland around it has been burned, part of the horse barn is collapsed, most of it has black soot marks all over.  The street in front still show the cracks from the serpent attacks.  The trio move quickly up the front steps and into the small ranch.  Heston waves at a couple women doing chores in the main room.  He leads the ranger and the druid to the back room on the first floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Opening the door slowly, quietly, he shows the others Vam.  Lying still in a bed, thin covers down to his waist, the man is bandaged over most of the top of his body.  Wet cloths hide the misery and pain beneath.  The skin that is visible is red, raw.  Vam is looking out the window opposite the group that just entered.  He doesn't turn his head when he says, "Knew you'd come.  Heston wouldn't've brought anyone else in here."  He turns his head to look at the trio.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Half of his face is covered in red, splotchy bandages.  The other side is wet with perspiration.  The black skin is cracked, distressed.  Like his eyes.  He tries to make sense of what he's seeing; a woman, an elf, and Heston.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Forgive my glamour, it is I, Maouleue. My poor soul, what has happened here?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Cleric Mage immediately falls to his knees aside the flayed man and begins praying with bowed head and radiant spirit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His eye becomes calmer, more... hopeful.  He beckons Maouelue in.  He tries to reach for the woman's shoulder, to comfort her, but is too weak to even find it.  After a few flailing attempts, his arm flops down and he takes a shuddering sigh.  His voice comes out as smoke and gravel.  "I appreciate you coming back.   But you shouldn't have.  The glamour is a good idea.  They came looking for you.  Pretty much right after you took off for those snakes."  He coughs.  "Seems like ten years ago, now.  Damn.  They came in the middle of the night, fires blazing.  Took down pretty much everyone.  Dragged the rest away.  Put a few to the question, then lit 'em up in the middle of town.  Like a fuckin' funeral pyre."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He coughs again, it wracks his body and he double over, causing more spasms.  Daran heads to the other side of him and commences with his magics.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Nine Devils.....I will suffer their filth  <i>NO LONGER!</i>”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam's body rises above the bed, then the spells his.  Immediately, the coughing abates.  The three watch as skin knits together.  Red welts of burn damage close.  The man takes a deeper breath, then starts to laugh.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You boys treat me too well, you know that.  By the gods, I'm tired."  He chuckles again and settles back in the bed.  "Shit was horrible before you go blaming yourself.  Three of the council being Muhlen's, no one knowing a damned thing about it...  Yeah, shit was done before you broke it open.  Hell, if you boys hadn't, we probably would have still be tripping along to their merry little melody.  This town owes you a debt it won't be able to fulfil.  Maybe that's what happened here.  The fates taking theirs."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shifts to look at Maouelue.  "Either way, they're looking for you and unless you've got an army behind you, I'd say steer clear.  At least for the time being."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A woman's voice comes softly from the doorway.  "Were my ministrations too rigorous for you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Ouelue raises an eye at the intrusion and puts on an air of welcome into the clerical fold, while remaining vigilant under the mask and taking in every inch of the newcomer.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A raven-haired woman stands meekly in the doorway.  Bits of dirt and moss slightly mar her stark white skin.  She is a beauty to behold, though.  Bellatrix's head is bowed at the woman before her, waiting for either a reprimand on her work, or to be run out of town.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bellatrix! Do mine eyes deceive me?!...Alas, I’ve made sure yours do you! My dear, fellow healer, please ignore my glamorous appearance. It is I, Maouleue. I am here to finish what I no doubt didn’t start, but sure as hell raked up!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Maouelue?!  Well, that is good news!"  She goes to shake, but decides to curtsy instead.  "And this must be Dieter, welcome back goodsirs."  She curtsies again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(dinner afk)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Ouelue chuckles.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah no, hehe...yes, I suppose that one’s on me. This here is my acquaintance and well, savior of a sort, Daran. He has shown me good faith and broken bread with me of his own accord. He helped me in a time of great need as did you that one...fateful day...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, meet Bellatrix, a healer, friend, and if I dare say, a longer sufferer of these machinations than myself. Heston and Vam can vouch as well.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But pardon the pleasantries, pray can we pull up by the hearth and take on some warm vittles? We need to make a plan and fast. We would have news of what moves in these parts, if you can give them.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ranger stands and folds his arm across his chest, bows to the woman.  Bellatrix is taken aback for a moment by the show of chivalry, then smiles at Ouelue.  "Handsome <i>and</i> good with formalities.  I'm impressed with the company you keep, good wizard."  She curtsies back to Daran.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam sits up, waves a hand to say he's okay to do so, and starts to rise.  "Let's head to the fire.  I'd like some... vittles, too."  He smirks at Ouelue.  Softly, to the wizard, he says, "Pardon me saying, you make a comely lass, friend."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hah! You should have known him when his name was Truth-or-Daran!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Aye, and I make a lassie come!</i>” <i>He winks privately to Vam.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam busts out laughing.  He puts an arm around Ouelue, partially to help lead him out, partially because he might fall over for laughing too hard.  Daran, almost imperceptibly, blushes and follows the group out, careful to make sure everyone goes before him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The discipline of Bahamut is one of Life after all. And what’s more lively than making more life?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Bahamut's been known to sew some seeds every now and again...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No Sow. No Reap.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(damn messed it up lol)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I liked 'now sow'!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The fire crackles as the five sit around it.  The two women helpers get Vam comfortable and Heston brings bowls of thick venison stew and fresh bread.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ma)ouelue is in high spirits right now, not jubilant, but excited, envigorated with purpose and comradely. (S)he gathers everyone around the hearth and begins to speak to the group in a dramatic and hushed whisper. Speech becomes a song of love and devotion. A condemnation for the masses who have, for honesty, been asked for apology by those who enjoy the silence. Those who wear guilt like shackles on their feet. A halo in reverse.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(S)he proffers a blank page of her spellbook-cum-tome of faith.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here, I stand, with the book in my hand, truth on my side. I will not substitute blindness for kindness. If anyone can smell a lie, let the accusations fly, but time after time I feel elation...hiiiigh...at the personal faith that I can feel reach out from each of you. Never again is what we swore the time before this madness happened again. Let us not be hos to these pimpfs! Reach out! Touch faith! Arise warriors of the light!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>(Ma)ouelue’s transformation has elicited a sped-up style.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They all are on fire with the words.  Heston is physically on the edge of his seat, legs bouncing in anticipation of a fight.  Daran, calmer, shows it in his eyes.  Although outwardly calm and resolute, Ouelue sees a spark in the elf's eyes that probably hasn't been there for quite some time.  Vam is impressed, too, but he is more subdued.  Their host sits forward and wipes his mouth with a checked cloth.  "Those are some powerful, powerful words.  And we are all proud and excited to be behind you and yours, friend.  The thing is...  we just don't have the numbers.  Not here, at least.  The way I see it, we can call these fuckers out, storm the castle, ride in on white steeds, the whole fucking deal.  But they've got things I've only seen in my nightmares.  And by the wagon load, to boot.  Might be best to take the word on the road, see what help we can drum up in, say, Neverwinter?  Or even Waterdeep?  Hell, Silverymoon might even have a hundred strong to ride with us, wipe the shits out in one go?  Unless you have a different idea already?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We’ve a man on the inside.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam studies the wizards face for a long moment.  The others look tensely at each other.  Vam says, "Dieter?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. He is within.” (S)he looks long in Vam’s eyes. </p><p>“How many are loyal to us in Oakhurst?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He swallows, wipes his mouth again, shakes his head.  "I don't think you understand, son.  There is no more Oakhurst."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm gonna pause there, seems like a fun place to stop!  You have a good evening sir!  I'm home all day tomorrow, we can rev it up any time!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Kirra, Denson, Saynea?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(GGz! Always a pleasure)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Always, sir.  I appreciate you sticking around for my crazy ramblings!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Having a blast. Fun to write in a free low-stakes yet deep way. Great to just have the imagination flowing.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Surely they are not <i>all</i> gone!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam lowers his eyes, looking simultaneously very sad and very old.  "I didn't see what happened to Kirra.  Denson fell.  Saynea was taken back to their camp, wherever that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Only two buildings are fully intact from the burnings - the tavern and the shrine."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ilmater...I wonder what became of the healer.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry dude, got a bit sidetracked tonight.  Pick it up again tomorrow morning?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(no prob!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't know that I ever saw what happened to her in all the craziness.  Just noticed the place was untouched.  Must have suffered enough, eh?"  He chuckles, somberly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell you what, though... if I get another round of healing, I might be able to walk through what's left with you, see what we're working with?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye Vam. All together now?” He looks at the other two healers in the eyes.</p>

<p>Maouelue and Daran hover around the man, while Bellatrix kneels at his feet.  They all lay hands and a golden glow surrounds Vam.  As the glow fades, the two women helpers gasp as a whole and hale Vam stands amidst his co-horts.</p><p>He looks at his arms and body.  Then he removes the bandage from his face.  Scars are still there, creasing his dark brown skin.  And the eye is still cloudy, not fully healed.  Maybe it never will be.  But the man standing in front of Ouelue and Daran smiles.</p><p>"Now...  well, then."  Wetness lines the bottom of his eyes as he looks to his friends with pure thanks.  "Much obliged.  All of you.  Thank you."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Vam...I am only repaying a debt that was already owed. You helped me and my <i>missing</i> friend Dieter in a time of need. We formed an alliance that day, and <i>one that I aim to keep alive!</i>"</p>

<p>"Who here will swear fealty to the cause of righteousness and the pursuit of a new valor in these lands!?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston steps forward, but then looks awkward.  "I... uh...  I will.  I don't have any weapons or anything.  Not sure how exactly to swear fealty.  But I'm with you guys!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"As am I," says Vam, smiling at the young ranch-hand.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I believe your cause is just, wizard.  As long as you will have me by your sides, I will fight."  Bellatrix's eyes sheen over quickly with a green flash.</p>

<p>The elf's illusion fades as he sits there in the warmth of the ranch. He comes out of his short reverie and walks out the back door and over to the nearest paddock, seeing what has become of the animals under Vam's care.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He cast his gaze around for Vam as he strolls over the lands, hoping to have a private word.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The lands are sparse now.  The rain has abated enough to show a muddy tract of land devoid of crops, a strange sight to be sure as last you saw it was flush and growing well.   Vam and Heston are in the barn's hayloft, you heard some muffled noises and talking.  There are couple horses, one of which you do recognize as the one Dieter took along on the start of the trek.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The elven reverie has tempered some of the flame that had run so hot at the past meeting and Maouelue pauses at the door to the barn and knocks on the doorframe deferentially.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I beg your pardon, friends."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I came to check on the horses. I see one of those you lent us has returned...what news of its mate?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Vam peeks his head down.  "Unfortunately only this one came back.  Heston's got something interesting up here, if you want to check it out.  Not sure what to make of it, but you might."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. A thousand apologies for the loss. She was a good steed for her part. We did not...intend to be underground so long..."</p>

<p><i>Maouelue ascends into the hayloft to investigate.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No, don't worry about it," he offers you a hand up to the loft.  "Most of the horses we have here are wild, or were at one point.  Heston here is a wizard with calming them, tempering them for farm work.  Other things happening right now, though."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the Dragon Mage steps up into the loft, he sees Heston sitting on a small stool next to an old chest.  Vam follows over and says, "Hes says it's an old family heirloom.  Haven't seen any heirloom like this, though.  What do you make of it?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston holds out a shaped, twisted piece of metal.  Long cylinders connect and protrude from a steel body.  The end curves down into a handle of sorts, on which some sort of bone or horn has been layered.  Heston says, "Was my pa's.  Only ever seen him use it once.  He gave me the name of a guy that can help fix it, if I ever needed it, but he's way out in the North territories.  Never ha much use for it.  Until now, that is."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed this is an interesting trinket."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He undoes a clasp, and a wide cylinder ops out.  It spins easily, showing chambers around the main cylinder.  Six, exactly.  "Pa taught me how to keep it oiled.  It sends these things whizzing like you wouldn't believe!"  He holds out rounded, tube-like projectiles, similar to elongated versions of Maouelue's frosted balls.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Think it'll help?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Keep that thing steady there lad."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches out for one of the projectiles, "...er, may I?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston readily hands Maouelue all of the items.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the cylindrical item and the elongated metal items. He chuckles mildly, thinking of the look on Dieter's face the first time he saw the new metal-clad zealous look. A mixture of dumbstruck horror and awe and confusion all grappling with the sense of camaraderie. The muscular contortions on the already shape-shifted visage were such as pleasant plethora of hilarity.</p><p></p><p>Here, holding this new metal monstrosity in his hands, he feels a pang of guilt holding the item and so sets it down carefully. He turns a professional eye to it instead, taking in its design and metalworkings.</p><p></p><p>"Was this everything in that chest there?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Just some family memories.  Clothes and mementos.  But I thought I could carry that, in case it might come in handy.  Hate to be unarmed, and I'm really no good with swords or bows," says Heston.  Vam chuckles, starts down the ladder.  "Well, as long as we're getting things together, I think I'll run by the iron works, see what's salvageable."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You take good care of that weapon Heston, and if you need company up North some day, I'll see it done."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage lays a warm hand on Heston's right shoulder.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a few, presentation.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The lord of life and light guide your aim freind."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I have a meeting at 12 as well.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also, didn't even notice this yesterday! )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The Warlock's Crypt!  Perfect!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston looks up at the wizard, beaming.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Now, tell me, whatever came of the <i>rest</i> of those serpentine reagents we gave you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Was there enough left over for the pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I do so desperately want to to deliver them to dieter and don't dare disappoint."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston guffaws as only a cowboy can.  "Sure, absolutely!  Forgot all about them in the commotion.  See here," and he takes you down the ladder into a corner of the barn set up as a makeshift tannery.  They are all as you requested, all fit to size.  They're extremely supple, too.  The craftsmanship is really top notch.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah perfect, Dieter'll love these. He's been jealous of my hat, armor, and bracers since the vault to be honest..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Won't say nothin' about it mind, but I see him sneaking glances."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"But...I might just keep the hat..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston says, "Now, here's something I though would be handy."  He shows off the bracers, saying, "There's a small area here for a dagger or small knife, but when there's nothing in there, because of the scales, it's seamless."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Aye, indeed! My man Dieter will find that <i>most</i> intriguing, if I've been following his passions precisely of late!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you for the beautiful work. We set up a bit of a forge ourselves down under as a matter of fact. If we get out the other side of this, might be we should make a bit of a go at it, after we learn a bit more up in the Northern reaches that is."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He pats your shoulder.  "If we get through what's next, just might hold you to that."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage returns a wry smile and a few crow's feet crinkle in the corner of his starry eyes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Alright now, let's round up the crew and hit the road. What say we ready a few steeds for our needs?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'll get right on that.  Four gonna work?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's bring five. Just in case Dieter is in rougher shape than we might expect. Reckon we could keep a fifth in tow?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks around at the stables, scratching his chin.  "Lemme see what I can round up.  Meet you back here in a few."  He makes haste out of the barn.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a beat and looks around at one of the last remnants of the Oakhurst he was just beginning to know and love. Here where they held that fateful council...What a mess! What impetuous hubris. The dark currents run deep and they are not easily displaced. One would do well to remember this going forward.</p><p></p><p>He makes for the main building and comes into Bellatrix's view checking on her reverie.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Bellatrix: "How fare ye, goodsir wizard?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well, let's just say I've got a fancy new hat!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He trades the Frostbitten Helm for the supplely-scaled, pointed had.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Our steeds arrive and we are off to put this dread pattern right!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Turning from the fire, she gives the wizard a deep look.  Without knowing her, some would say it was a dark, foreboding gesture.  Knowing who she is... it might still be foreboding, but Maouelue knows it as a introspective look.  She purses her lips, goes into her pack.  "Would you allow me an... insight?  Into our upcoming venture?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue slows his gusto replies reverently, “Of course, anything.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What would you ask of me?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Often people are scared of that which they cannot see, hear, physically interact with.  You and I know, however, that there is a weave to the world that is unseen, yet bonds everything together.  There are ways to manipulate this weave.  But for every action, there is a reaction.  Every now and again, I like to try and see the eventuality of those actions and reactions.  I give you the choice - rune, card, or dice?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Rune.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>h!rune</p>

<h3>Helios – Helios</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mysterious woman smirks a little at the choice.  She reaches into her pack, closes her eyes, rummages more.  Then, slowly, she brings her closed fist out of the bag.  </p><p>"Runes help us connect with the elements.  They are an intimate connection to our inner being.  My runes have been with me for a very long time, since I was a child.  The longer you have a connection with them, and the closer they are to the body in that time, the more accurate they can be."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With that, she opens her hand.  The rune that looks back at you is carved into smooth, sanded bone.  The carved section is black, contrasting greatly against the bleached white of the bone.  Bellatrix's smile fades as she looks at the symbol.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“This symbol is out of balance.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She peers at you and squints. "You've recently found a new deity.   But that deity has some connection to the horrors you've faced.  Even with the heightened piety, or maybe because of it, you are more of a target than ever before.  Not just by the forces you seek out.  Things move in the shadows, to compel you off of your path.  Or maybe onto the correct one?  Maouelue, be wary of going farther away or closer to your patron.  You are on a shield balanced atop a sword.  One slight move any way might plunge you into chaos."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue listens to the words and stares at the symbol as if in a trance. He moves his right hand over the top of the rune and pulls his water skin out with his left. He pours a few drops into the weave his other hand is making above the rune and thin, beaded arcs of water begin to form. The arcs spiral and conform into a column of circles, spinning about a vertical axis. The wizard’s left hand stows the skin and comes over top of the cylinder, pressing downward and spinning counterclockwise. Six beaded rings of water spread out around a central one, mimicking the pattern of the rune below. This form hovers for a few moments and Maouelue’s hands come to a rest. He speaks an elven word and a spire begins to coalesce out of the vapors surrounding the sigil. At first it appears to run across the depth of the pattern, but then turns and reveals the three spread legs from below, now making a facsimile of the rune. Hovering there for a moment, another word is uttered and the spindle-legged stalk begins to tilt vertically making a three dimensional spire held by a tripod of feet. The feet connect at the alternating intersections of the inner circle with the outer.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue’s eyes shine bright blue. It almost seems as if the Light comes from behind him and through him into the watery symbol as a cold radiance comes and freezes the re-balanced rune in place. He raises his gaze toward Bellatrix and sets the structure atop her heirloom rune.</p><p></p><p>“We must approach the old conflict with new dimensions, if we are to find balance.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You still have inspiration die, correct?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Belltrix's smile returns as Maouelue reinterprets her reading.  "Wisdom is often found throughout dimensions.  If one can only see what needs to be seen when they need to see it."</p>

<p>Maouelue holds Trix’s gaze awhile then nods and gestures onward. “If we are to regain our balance, we must indeed establish our pillars in the area. Let us find Vam and Heston and discuss our strategy.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods, gets up from the fireplace to watch out the window.  The rain has stopped, an eerie fog has set upon the town.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(kiddo bed. will post up soon.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stays his advance and turns to regard the scene with Trix. “A dire scape to be certain... but come now, we will make our own omens on the road.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her lips purse.  She waits for Maouelue to lead the way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads out through the moist land to the edge of the paddock to meet with the rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mist slowly rises all around like steam from a lake.  It gives the world an ominous feel.  Dark clouds above, still threatening a downpour, mixed with the haze sets a macabre scene.  A howl can be heard in the distant forest.  Vam and Heston are in the barn, saddling and settling the horses.  Vam waves to the two of you as you enter.  Daran is walking around, inspecting the horses, whispering to them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ho there. Many thanks for the horses and bridling. My friends, we must make haste to our next destination, yet we must be firm in our conviction. The forces that move, as Vam said, are vile, powerful, and far reaching. We would do well to set up a network around the Neverwinter. I have seen a spire of three converging and ascending upwards, an omen that I take at this moment as a guide to our cause. Let us create a network across Neverwinter, Longsaddle, and Luskan. We will seek information in subtle ways throughout these towns. Lie low and strengthen our position. There is no telling where Dieter may be at this moment. I know this in my heart now. I must not let zeal overtake clarity of mind. Pray, what would each of you say to this?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The four look between themselves.  They seem to be testing the waters, see who is going to take over the second-in-command role, all seemingly deferring to each other.  Vam nods, looks at Heston.  Heston nods, looks between Vam and the others.  Daran looks pensive.  Bellatrix turns her keen eye to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"What you say is very wise.  The two towns of Longsaddle and Neverwinter will have sympathetic ears.  Luskan, I fear...  That might be war on a second front we do not have the ability for.  It all depends on our quarry.  If it be Dieter, then I offer to scry to locate him.  If our goal is to garner troops and wage battle on the Runemark's men, then cavalry is needed.  We can do both, but then delegation is the key."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What contacts have you men in any of the nearby towns? Do we have any friends or advantages in Longsaddle? If what you say about Luskan is true, then it's either East and South, or make our way through the North Neverwinter Wood and head for the coast."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When you mention Neverwinter Woods, you see Daran get very uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(No worries, enjoy the jam!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks uncomfortable when the Wood is mentioned.   He involuntarily clutches at a chain around his chest and takes a step backwards.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston shrugs.  "I don't really have any contacts or anything.  Especially nearby.  I can ride and check in with the powers-that-be in Longsaddle, though.  Been there a handful of times."</p><p>Vam says, "I have a few merchant contacts in both places.  I can take whomever to check into what either can help with."</p><p>Bellatrix just puts her head down and shakes it.</p><p>Daran, speaking softly, says, "Neverwinter Woods is my home.  I can ensure anyone who travels through will be safe."</p>

<p>Maouelue eyes the half-elf for a long beat. “Thank you Daran. Is there aught else you would tell us about the Wood? What of your people there?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks at the ground for a few beats, the awkward silence growing.  Finally he looks up, directly into Maouelue's eyes, and says, "None of my people there any longer.  There are... places we should avoid, and I can help you with that.  The safest route is around, but if there is a need to go through, I can help.  All manners of things are drawn to the woods."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...I am sorry dear Daran. I can see there is great pain this causes you. I will pry no further.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I think we would do well not to fracture our fellowship into too many groups. I am of a mind to have those that would go to Longsaddle establish a foothold in the community. I shall lead a party into Neverwinter. I will not ask any of you to brave this with me, but would welcome any support may it be forthcoming.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, there may not be need to delve too far into the Forest, but I would appreciate its cover rather than the suspicion and exposure of the road. I will follow your lead in your domain.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods.  But you can tell he's still holding something back.   The rest of the group seem bolstered by the fact they won't be individually left alone on a task.  Welcoming the challenge, Van says, "I can take Heston with me to Longsaddle.  We can round up some folks and then meet back here?  Or I can just ride with them to Neverwinter and we can march from there, too.  Your call, Mao."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(nice!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Good, good. I would have you stay in Longsaddle for the time being. If you are able, send word ahead to anyone who may be friends to our cause in Neverwinter. Vam you mentioned you know a few merchants. Can we trust anyone to give us a place to lay low when we get there?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You'll be faster than anyone or anything I can send along.  But when you get to Neverwinter you can check in with Liset Cheldar.  She owns the Moonstone Inn, in the Protector's Enclave.  She'll be able to put you up and find things you need.  Might even introduce you to the Lord Protector hisself!  He'd be able to get a force to be reckoned with, being on the Alliance and all!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"That would be welcome indeed. We might do well to gain such an ally in our cause. Where should we send word to reach you to let you know of our arrival?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix breaks in and says, softly, "I may be able to help with that.  If there shall be two groups, this method of communication will suffice."  She pulls two stones out of her pack.  A sigil it etched into each stone, the same on both.  She hands one to Vam, then one to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"These are sending stones.  They carry a message only to the other, and it can only be sent or retrieved if the bearer or sender speaks the correct word."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the stones intently. "Dear me! Dieter has a set just like these! I don't think we rightly knew their use or we would be in a hell of a lot better spot right now!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If only we could reach him."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The glow in Maouelue's eyes dims considerably at the thought of his missing friend.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stares at Maouelue.  "To send or receive, the word is <i>vuorl</i>."  She puts a hand in Maouelue's.  "We must stop by my mirror before we travel to Neverwinter."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You will ride with us then, my lady?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I will.  But not before I scry for Dieter."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Yes, I would very much love to see what we can of him. Any information we can gain of his status will be of immense service. Vam, Heston, Daran, you should come too. We had all best be informed. Let us to this at once."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All nod in agreement, saddle up, and are ready to go.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trip is quick, seeing as how this time you have Bellatrix in the lead.  She welcomes all into her home, unveils the mirror, and stands before it pensively.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue is caught by a wave of nostalgia and reminiscence of how simple things had seemed back when they were first here.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She wrings her hands, then takes a deep breath.  She places her hand on the mirror's surface.  The reflection fades to black, grey smoke swirls, coalesces.  Colors appear, render into shapes.  The forms take on the visage of Dieter and another man, very well known to Maouelue.  The man is sitting in a cell, looking at Dieter occasionally.  Dieter is unconscious in the bed next to him.  Another form can be seen hazily in a third bed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(have a meeting for an hour)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(feel free to continue the scry though! This is exciting 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix, her hands on both sides of the mirror now, knuckles white, focuses her gaze more.  The picture recedes out of the door, up hallways, through walls.  It takes some time, but after a few beats, a citadel comes into view.  It's dark stairs lead to a spired set of towers, all decrepit and crumbling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the picture moves farther out, the darkness can be seen as the bottom of a chasm.  The chasm, or maybe a dark gorge, cuts a wide path.  As the mirror's picture continues to pan out, the gorge ends and an immense rock wall goes up, up, up, cresting at the rim of a crater, easing down into a caldera of a volcano.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She doesn't seem to be in any pain.  She's more than likely highly exerted herself from the scry.  It doesn't typically happen, but there are occasions where this might occur.  Normal healing should help her.</p>

It might be kinda tough to get to him, unless anyone else knows more about it.  I saw Mount Hotenow, and the gorge that peels off to the East is where the tower-thing is.  All I can think of - and mind you, this is just a terror-tale to scare kids - it that the place we saw was the Sunless Citadel."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Heston gives a low whistle and slumps back in a chair.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods, somberly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks from one to the other. He has been underground enough to know what fel things reside in the sunless places of these parts. </p><p>“Please Vam, go on. I think, under the circumstances, that no ‘terror-tale’ would be too unbelievable. I saw one of those madmen with mine own eyes animating an abomination. Oh there are dark magicks indeed at work here.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Kids to bed real quick, be back soon!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Ayuh," he starts, tilting his hat back and looking grave.  "Legend says there is a dragon that keeps the fires of Mount Hotenow going.  An ancient red dragon, who constantly bathes in the blood of the world..  One day, a conqueror built a tower along the river flowing past the volcano.  The conqueror had heard the rumors and dug straight down into the land to make a path underneath Hotenow so as to directly confront the dragon.  A massive eruption took place after this path was made, and the wonderous tower the conqueror had constructed slid into the rift, never to be seen again.  Crazy story, huh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Crazy....You mean to say the Citadel fell <i>into</i> the breach?... Dieter and I found a vast crevasse underground just before...just...”, He stifles a croaky breath. “...Just before he was taken.” The memory of building the forge, the weight of his armor relieved, the shared sweat and laughs and discovery of the joys of making...it all washes over Maouelue like a beam of starlight refracting off his sword into a million colors, blinding him with chromatic grief. </p><p></p><p>“Yes...he is there. I know it in my heart. Daran, do you remember where you found me?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(lmk if you ever want to live rp this campaign sometime btw.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Oh, I never even thought of that!  I've been having too much fun with the pbp!!  I might have some time in the next few days to do so.  Some of our 'followers' might be out of the loop, though!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Daran: "I do.  That rift meanders a ways, but the origin is in the West.  If I  had to hazard a guess, it might lead to the volcano.  Truthfully, haven't been brave enough to traverse it."  He smiles, wanly.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah pbp definitely has its own magic to it that i love, but it would be fun to do a bit here and there. would def want to record/transcribe it though.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It all makes so much sense now. The snakes tunnels in Oakhurst, the Muhlen vault, the abyssal ravine... <i>That’s</i> how they’ve remained unseen. <i>That’s</i> how they are moving in the shadows. Sunless indeed. If this is the case...pray, perhaps we should reconsider our apprehension of the matter...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Perhaps...we needn’t stray so far afield after all. Perhaps we have all we need right here. Stay awhile and listen...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They lean in to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage solemnly doffs The Frostbitten Helm and places it on the floor. Next he silently slings the Shield of Disruption off his back and places it to the right and under the Helm. The Sword of the Mists and its scabbard come next, and now the outline of a warrior is beginning to take form. The Giantess Bracers come next and the elven wizard rubs at his wrists as they do, the skin puffy and pale with long suppression. Having donned the splint previously for ease of movement and discretion of sound, he goes over to his Bag of Holding™️ and pulls out the previously animated plate mail from Mulhen’s vault and places it in the center of the form. Lastly, he pulls out a serpentine amulet and a tattered book, <i>The Barbarian’s Wind</i>. These he places directly in front of Bellatrix and his eyes, who have been pointedly focused on the assembly until this point, meet hers in a somber stare.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(TM!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here lie the relics of Lord Muhlen. He kept more than secrets in those halls. The Vault we found was surrounded by undead and grave warnings. Here lie the heirloom treasures of his delving. He sought deep, deep beneath even the lowest foundation of his haunt. The trap leading below the vault carried us into vast caverns of mystery. The book you see here was a gift, you see... A relic left to his <i>worthiest</i> of offspring, his...’dearest daughter.’ </p><p></p><p>As fate would have it, we met the man you saw there...”, He points to the scrying lens, “...in the mirror. That man gave us aid in the direst of circumstance. He saved and healed us when all else would have failed. With us, he traveled deeper intro the tunnels, showing us the way to many curiosities. <i>He seemed to know the tunnels in a way.</i> Frumious, or Frume as he would have us call him, led us to the first of many serpentine artifacts we would find down there. Altars and reliefs of ancient Naga rituals, dark sacrifice, a multi-headed dragon laying waste a continent...</p><p></p><p>As it turns out, some waste was laid on our behalf as well. You see, the serpents...well, three of them stood in this very room the last time we met. Three that have been lain low by our hands. Mine, Dieter’s, Frume’s and...” He stops a moment to consider the curiosity of the mirror men, the Henchys. Just how did they fit into all this? Should he even mention them? “...and some...I’m not quite sure how to explain it, but some magical-summonings-cum-acquaintances-cum-cohort? You see we found this mirror back when we first went seeking Douglas....” Maouleue takes a beat and surveys his audience. “...ah, never mind all that. Suffice it to say the Muhlen sisters <i>and their brother</i> are no more. Just how they tie into the Runmark’s machinations though, I am not yet sure. Please, friends of the light, understand this one last thing, the very place we finally surfaced was right atop a bottomless chasm underground.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It would seem where once we were saved by the light, we may now need descend into darkness in order to restore balance to these lands and to the lives of all who tread near this corruption.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Eyes go wide.  Looks pass between everyone.  They look to the items, then Maouelue, then each other.  All in silence.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, Vam breaks the quiet, saying, "Now, wait a minute.  If you're saying this citadel...  you've possibly been in?  Or near?  Then...  the rest could be true, too?"   He scratches his stubble.  "And what about the Runemark's forces?  If they're using that thing as a base of operations or something, well...  what else could they be harboring down in the depths?  We might have a difficult time taking down a human army.  But what if...?"  His voice fades as the possibilities surround the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It may be that a small band such as ourselves, moving quietly and unseen could be the best chance at taking them down. They won’t expect an attack from within, and if I were a betting elf, I’d say they won’t expect me to go back down in a hurry... Nevertheless, we should take caution. If only there were some way to draw out their forces, draw any of the guard away from the halls within...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix starts at this last from Maouelue.  "But, isn't that what we are proposing already?  Bringing a force in front of them, drawing them out?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I must admit, I am torn. If this is indeed the place, then I fear it will only grow stronger with every passing moment. What of magical means? Could we not cause some sort of disturbance of another sort? One that does not risk the will and loyalty of others? And most importantly, one that does not take so much to time! To think, that I was to lead us <i>away</i> from the place! No, I fear if our man is caught in that dread place, I dare not delay any longer, lest all hope be lost for his redemption.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group ponders.  Bellatrix sits up on her couch, Vam paces near the entryway.  Heston is meandering, taking in the strange ambience of the witch's home.  Daran sits on a side chair, eyes closed, deep in thought.  Worry lines wrinkle his usually serene face.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seconds turn to minutes.  The silence, and worry, deepens.  Vam starts to say something, then shakes his head and stops.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, there is a soft knocking at the front door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lightning hits, thunder rolls, outlining the doorway with an electric white light.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks up, peers around the room at the others.  Saying, "Excuse me," she gets up and heads toward the entry.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She grips the handle, and swings the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another strike of lightning outlines a hunched figure.  When the color comes back to the world, the group sees an old, grey-haired woman, wearing worn travelling clothes and carrying a carpet bag over a forearm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix gasps.  "Sister?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm going to pause it there, let it settle for a bit.  Have a few more things to work out, too, but I LOVE where this is going!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes! the stakes just keep getting higher. I love it. GG brother.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The blue glow permeates everything.  A pulse beats, intensifying the miasma around Dieter.  He cannot see or feel anything except for his own consciousness within the glowing blue-grey fog.  </p><p></p><p>A white light descends from above.  It is small, even as it gets closer to Dieter it doesn’t grow at all.  This silver-white ball of light stops what seems like inches from the druid, and words emanate in the void.  “Thank you for your trust, Druid.  I fear I may have inadvertently scarred your friend as well.  I will try to make this as brief as I can.”  The ball of light morphs into the visage of a wizened man.  All of his features are tinged blue, but Dieter gets the sense that he is an old human, and his robes suggest a wizard or scholar of the arcane.  </p><p></p><p>“My name is Lord Alezander Muhlen.  I have been entombed in this… place for many decades.  Originally I had heard rumors that this place was the center of Netherese lore.  Upon my arrival, I found illithids making this their base and… reaping the legends of our forefathers.  To my great consternation, they were much more powerful that I could have imagined.  They captured me, tortured me for information.  Finally, they entombed my body in one of their stasis-pods.  Possibly for further experimentation.  You need to free me.  I am lost in here.  However, I can give you a general direction to where I am. Follow the light I can provide, be wary of the illithid warriors, and we will stop their foul plot upon our lands!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(want to take time to properly reply to this one. a bit busy with fam today.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely, sir, I'll be doing some fam stuff too today.  No worries, have a great holiday friend!  The best to you and yours, please tell everyone 'Happy Holidays' from all of us!!)</p>

<p>(Merry Christmas Joe! Same to your brood!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
“Lord Muhlen...of all of the spirits to find here....You were presumed dead! Your daughters...you drew them into this foul delve and they... not being so fortunate as yourself have died for it. Your little vipers were my would-be-assassins. We have walked your Vault, we have found your dirty secrets, your lust for power seems to have poetically played out wouldn’t you say? In short, I am loathe to serve the architect of so much misery, the one who brought darkness and destruction to Oakhurst through your greed. But I am not one blind to redemption, and if you would aid me in return, perhaps we may reach an accord... Answer me these three questions Alezander. 

One: Are you a monstrosity-of-a-man or a man-of-a-monstrosity?

Two: What connection do the illithids have with Runemark?

Three: What do you know of Tiamat and *The Victory of our Dragon Queen*?”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The visage of the old man blinks; first his eyes, then his entire body switches, almost imperceptibly, between the ball of light and the wizard.  He cocks his head to the side, sizing Dieter up.  He smiles.  (Insight check for more!)

"My daughters are dead, then?  We shall see.  As for my lust for power being played out...  we shall see there as well.  I shall answer your questions, Druid:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"One -I am both.  A bargain was made a very long time ago with the forefathers of our forefathers.  In return, I was to see their glorious light brought back from the brink of annihilation and render up unto them the dregs of this world.  They were to reign again, and I was to be their ambassador.  It may still be, yet.  The torch has been passed, as they so colloquially say.  The time may yet come to fulfill the terms of our agreement.  The Great World Serpent may yet draw breath upon the Material Plane.  And, if it does so, all humanity will fall under their carnage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Two - I <i>am</i> the Runemark.  Or at least, I was.  My death brought upon a great many changes, one of which is the transference of title.  The Runemark name has been handed down from generation to generation, starting centuries back.  My ancestors were sailors, and went across the great ocean to learn the secrets of the Runes from the Giants.  No human had ever or <i>has</i> ever done this, and we were able to grow in power and prestige because of it.  When a Runemark dies, the title and powers are passed down to their kin.  The tricky part is, one can never tell who will be the recipient.  It's not always the eldest, or even part of the direct family.  Bastards have been known to take up the mantle.  It has even driven a few mad when they've received their newly-redeemed gifts.  Needless to say, though, if I <i>were</i> to come back, I fully expect my powers to return as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Three..." He chuckles.  "I'm guessing since you even <i>have</i> to ask me the question, you aren't up on your dragon lore.  Let me enlighten you, Druid.  Tiamat is the world breaker, according to legend.  She, being of five heads of every chromatic color, resides in the Nine Hells.  Since you do not know of her, I assume as well that the Cult of the Dragon has not yet unleashed her fury.  According to the prophecy, there will be one who is able to bring together the elements needed to call forth the Dragon Queen, ultimately starting the Last War - dragons versus the rest of humanity.  It seems there are many old ones who believe this land to be theirs, and will stop at nothing to see it back in their possession.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only thing to do is to release me from my prison.  I, and only I, can right what the illithids and the Dragon Cult are doing, so all Nine Hells don't erupt.  I know it's trading one type of fate for another, but who knows...  maybe there is a way to appease the Naga and not have them usurp Faerun.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(holy shit!!!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter speaks to the wizard, demanding answers, he notices the wizard morph.  As the wizard comes back to his human form, for a moment, Dieter saw a familiar face.  For the briefest of moments, Frume was looking back at him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Thoughts race through Dieter’s mind. He must make up his mind quickly, but this? What could have prepared him for this? Should he save this demon-man and risk the consequences of his resurrection, or allow the dark forces at work to continue their machinations? </p><p></p><p><i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend they say, but what if my friend may also be my fiend...? And what of Frume, is not this shadow also the enemy of my friend? Alas there is no time for deep rumination, but certainly any advantage that may be taken over my pursuers must be taken... I must decide...</i></p><p></p><p>He considers a long as he can, then utters, </p><p></p><p>“Lord Muhlen, you are keen to sense the dichotomy of my dilemma. I offer you this; I will free you as penance for your daughters untimely end at our hands. From there, let us unite in the felling of these dread usurpers. Time will tell if we can be allied, but there is no doubt we have much to gain from each other if so. I’ll take my chances with that, but please, release Frumious. Though his motivations be fraught, his heart be true. Aye, man-of-many-faces-and-names, I will free you. Pray, it doesn’t take me to mine own doom.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The apparition looks puzzled, scratches his beard, whispers something under his breath.  (Perception to pick it up!)</p><p>He then looks at Dieter, serious.  "You have no hope of fighting these illithids without aid.  Mind flayers are known not only to be cunning but to also possess powers unknown to the arcanists of our time.  I will help you defeat these fiends, but the aid I can give you lies behind the closed doors that have stymied you.  The answer you seek lie in an ancient language, but it is not Netherese.  Only in my death have I discovered the truth.  They are illithid shrines.  The west door you may enter with the word <i>Sungovall</i>.  The south may be entered with the word <i>Svankigare</i>.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"In these halls you may find objects of great power, but remember, do not lose yourself in the strength of these items.  Once you have braved the trials to receive these, follow the east past from this hall.  The light I can provide will guide you.  But beware, there are monsters up ahead.  After you defeat the menace, you'll find my tomb.  I will appear to you there and help you continue your quest."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Dieter stretches to hear the hidden whispers, and can only catch: "He......  yet."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have no trust for one who whispers secrets to someone unknown in my presence. Have out with it or stay entombed for eternity. Your mutterings betray you, fiend.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard smiles.  "Not at all.  It is you, I fear, who are betrayed, my young Druid.  I was merely...  surprised.  About why my son wouldn't tell you his real name."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“For one in such need of mine aid, thou woulds’t do well to speak plainly. Your riddles serve neither cause.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No riddles here.  I gave you the information you need to get through the doors.  Finding my body and resurrecting me is in both our interest.  Then I will be able to show you a way out of this juggernaut.  We are done here.  Act in any way you see fit."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And in a wisp of blue-grey smoke, the void collapses in on itself.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is standing where he was last, in the vast, cold room with the banners, the columns, and a very confused Frume.  He was just grasping air a second ago, now his hand is grabbing your leg.  His mouth hangs agape, trying to piece things together.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dastardly Demon....”, Dieter spits.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Riddles encased in a labyrinth entombed in a mystery!”, The disgusted druid deliberates.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As his sight comes back to, he lays eyes on Frume and thinks for a moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wwww...  What happened??  Did you...  go somewhere?  You just flashed!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Did you and the fam have a good Xmas?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah it was great! You?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Very nice indeed!  Tried to fit too much in, though.  I was <i>tired</i> by about 5!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...had a vision of a way out though...it will not be simple.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume looks worried.  "Aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. What of you? You seem to have taken quite a shock yourself? What was it happened to you?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well, I'm sobered up after that light came down and flashed on you!  Thought you were going to be spirited away or summat..."  He takes a deep breath, trying to center himself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah! I’m sure you are, I’m sure you are friend, and for that I am grateful.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes a beat...”Frume, this may seem odd, but I’m fearful we could be in for a fair amount of trouble before we make it out of here. You have been so great a companion, I am embarrassed not to have asked you more about yourself. Hells! I don’t even know your last name, ha! Pray, let us become better acquainted.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I’ll start. My full name is Dieter Deleter, druid of the coast. I come from the sword coast on an island just west of the Trollbark Forest. My family name is actually De Liter, but after....after the tragedy, I was banished and branded Deleter until I return in with my honor and receive absolution.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter starts speaking, talking of surnames and histories, the druid sees Frume start to close off, slightly.  Something in his eyes gives Dieter that there is something there that makes Frume conflicted.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yeah, partly my fault, I guess.  Truly well met, Dieter.  I'm actually from around the area.  Lived close to Oakhurst all my life.  My last name..  is Bandersnatch.  Family name after a great-great ancestor slayed an enormous beast from the Abyss.  I'm sorry to hear of the tragedy in your history, I truly am.  After all you've done, would you not be able to return redeemed now?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter is skeptical.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ah! You’re from around Oakhurst? Where did you live?  In the hills? By the river? A big house outside of town?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The last line gets him.  His eyes go wide and he looks down at his feet.  Slowly, he says, "What kind of vision did you have there, friend?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Don’t mean to gloss over the bit about the Abyssal beast as well, that sounded fierce!”...”Wait, oh what’s that? Didn’t catch you there...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Head still down, eyes still downcast, he turns and walks toward the S door.  He starts speaking very heavily, as if the words cause him great pain and are being wrenched from him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"My first explanation to you was a bunch of lies, I was never the hero of a town nor did I lose everything in a fire.  Well... not until recently.  You and Maouelue burned down my family home, so technically, I guess my first statement did come to pass...  in a matter of speaking."  He looks up at Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, if I coulda burned the fuckin' place to the ground before, I would 'ave!  My real name is Jaecob Muhlen.  I'm one of several middle sons of the Muhlen throng.  And," his eyes grow sorrowful, "I'm the Runemark."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He chuckles.  "Although, our youngest wouldn't have you believe it.  Wilm always coveted our father's power and influence.  He was always searching after the next legacy for the Muhlen name.  Problem is, this gift or curse or whatever-the-hell it is that our family has...  it doesn't exactly follow a pattern.  The eldest heir doesn't always get it.  Nor does the most sane.  I actually received it fairly young.  And I tried to give it back, I tried to rectify the fucking situation.  But all to naught, as it seems.  Never found the Giant's lands, never really even crossed the Trackless Sea.  Got stranded out on an island, pirates picked me up.  To get away, I told them..." He starts laughing in earnest, now, "Told 'em that I could turn silver to gold!  Told them I could increase their coffers with a single mark!!  They had me prove it, and they let me live.  Pieces of shite, they all were.  Dropped me in the middle of Luskan for dead.  Well...  well, you wanted to hear my history.  That's just some of the sordid details.  What else did this vision tell you?  Am I getting it all right so far?"  He leans against a wall and slides down to sitting, head in his hands.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Heh, and there we have it at last. Don’t worry Fru– Jaecob, we all have our demons, our skeletons in the sea. The truth will heal in all this and now it is my turn. Alezander...that was your father’s name, yes? It was he I met in the light-of-the-dark. He told me of the secret family history. He railed against the illithid usurpers that have taken this hold. And lastly he...he implored me to set him free...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Frume/Jaecob immediately looks up at you, fear straining his face as you say this last.  "Aye, that was my father's name.  And if he was fighting ill-thids, or whatever you said, so be it.  He can rot in Nessus for all I care, good riddance.  Whatever he <i>implored</i> you to do, though, forget about it.  He has a sweet tongue and a black heart.  Let it lie, friend.  Let's just concentrate on getting the hell outta this place.  Then, maybe, we can see to stopping my ignoble brother in his insane notion of 'conquering the world', aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye, a silver tongue indeed he has, but not so easily are his deeds swept away into forgiveness. Even as he would seem to offer me aid in this endeavor, never an altruistic motive did I perceive. However, perhaps this new understanding gives you an opportunity for a greater redemption. These beast appear to have his soul captive, draining it for power and secrets. Mayhaps you could be the one to give him his final end? After all, the old scars don’t seem to have fully healed, let alone that new one he just opened in your mind. I won’t implore you, but if we are to survive this, we must speak plainly and true. What do you say?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"One in my mind...?"  Jaecob looks scared and his eyes go unfocused as he tries to reason this new bit of information.  Finally he says, "Aye, you're right.  I'm sorry, Dieter.  For my dishonesty and for my lack of courage.  I'll follow your lead on this, of course.  And if there be redemption here for any of us, let us find it, if only to go back to our families with heads held high."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Time for you to be rid of the ripples of this curse my good man, for you have suffered greatly and it seems little of it is of your doing. I accept your apology and I am sorry to have plumbed the depths of your spirit so, but it would seem, my hand was forced...as it so often has been these days. Come Jaecob, or Frume if you still prefer. We must all wear the name we choose even if we cannot run from that which we are given.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sidles up next to the melancholy man and gestures to the door. “It is time to move on, friend.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sprawling room has a caved wall in the SW corner of the room, a strange stone door sits on a pedestal of sorts, with no form of handle again.  There is a small set of stairs on the E wall raising up to a offset room.  There are several tattered tents or makeshift shelters throughout.  All appear to be empty, at least from a cursory glance.  The pink-purple light is emanating from small braziers all over, at base of all of the walls.  There looks to be something inside the braziers, giving of the strobing glow.  They are not all in sync, however, making you feel a slight bit off balance.  Lastly, the duo notice standard wooden doors to the S and W, aside from to door in the curved wall jutting out.  (Perception or investiagtion on anything you want, just let me know what you're looking for/at!)...(and Roll20 is updated, too.)</p>

<p>As Dieter walks slowly into the room he rubs at an itch on one of his temples. He takes a keen look at the brazier down to his left and makes a note to inspect the tents thoroughly afterward.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter scans a couple braziers close to him.  They seem to have oddly shapes crystals in them, again giving off light.  The tents have seen better days, although, that being said, they have more than likely been standing and decaying for quite some time.  Could be years to decades, it's hard to say.  The animal hide on them was cured, but they are still worn and threadbare.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can take advantage on all of these, Jaecob is helping you!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter looks in a couple tents, he can see into one and traces of dried blood can be viewed.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He turns his head as he passes back by the door and beckons Shelli to join.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shelli lets out a <i>"Mwaaap"</i> and squeezes through the doorway.  As the investiagtion continues, the tents look either picked over or very sparse.  There are remnants of fires here and there.  The one with the blood has a corner covered in it, splashing up on the leathers.  Nothing else can be discerned from the tents, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Jaecob, I must admit, my spirit and body are weary. The encounter with your father’s shade on top of all that led to this imprisonment has taken its toll. Pray, help me gather these crystals to put out the lights and let us take rest in these tents. Not the Pig and Falcon by a long shot, but better than being completely exposed as well. Shelli, we’ll rotate our guard and make sure you can rest too, poor thing.” He strokes a slimy stalk affectionately.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tents are clear, as they were yesterday.  There is nothing that presents itself to either Dieter or Jaecob, but something does catch Muhlen's attention. He approaches the altar at the top of the stairs.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What is it Jaecob?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'm not sure.  Looks expensive, though!"</p><p>As he slowly climbs the gradual steps, he points to a golden alms box underneath the altar table.  At opposite ends of the altar, two skulls of some lizard-like creature stare down at Jaecob as he climbs.  In the center of the table is an egg-shaped object atop a short pedestal.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter climbs the steps and stands next to Jaecob. He peers at the object curiously, taking it in against all he has seen with the tapestries, reliefs, and of course his recent conversation with the spirit Lord.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Religion check, please!)</p>

<p>(afk awhile)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite tell what the iconography is meant for, but it is a brilliantly wrought piece.  Solid gold, with very intricate designs.  There is a lock on the front, looks like it would open like a typical chest.  (Perception for more of the area or investigation for traps/locks.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>It's locked but otherwise looks fine to Dieter!  (Sleight of hand for lockpicking, perception check for other things, or investigation if you want anything specific!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter is wary about the hidden potentials of the strange room and altar. He moves his body in a circular motion sending out radiating sparkles as he speakers the incantation searching for traces of magic here.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The druid gets a few <i>pings</i> from the spell.  There is a slight aura around the chest, abjuration magic.  The egg shape on the table has a very strange aura around it, you can't really tell the school of magic, though.  The door on the curved wall has an aura of abjuration magic.  The crystals are also giving off a strange vibe.  Not so much an aura, but something about them is on the cusp of magic.</p>

<p>The piece of metal Dieter finds bends and almost breaks off in the locking mechanism.  He's able to retract it.  Jacob hands you a pair of lockpicks, saying, "Here, these might work a bit better, aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Dieter takes 1 point of damage as he touches the crystals.  Suddenly, the voices start up again.</p><p>"Tie this off, quickly..."</p><p>"HOW could they just disappear?..."</p><p>"... Should be ready now...."</p><p>"...Pretty sure I won that last one..."</p><p>"Brains...  BRAINS..."</p><p>"There is no way out!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the druid brings the glowing crystals closer to Jaecob, Muhlen starts twitching and going into seizures.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter quickly hurries the crystals away to the opposite side of the room, taking note of their strange properties. The connection to these voices seems important, but he’s not sure how much more he can take. He rushes back over to Jaecob to check on his condition.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(scratch that. no cast.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He pours a bit of water from his skin onto Jaecob’s forehead.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tremors stop as the crystals are retreated.  As the water pours onto the man's head, Dieter doesn't get the sense that it helps all that much, but the man does seem to be more at peace.  Still unconscious, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(do those voices come through one by one as he touches each crystal or are they all together?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(They come through all at once.  There's a lot more being said, but those are the, for lack of a better word, snatches of what you can understand.  Plus some more that you probably don't.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(oh snatches is a great word 🤣)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter has an idea. He heads back over to one of the crystals and attempts to bash it with the Eagle end of his bladestaff.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>His aim is pretty terrible though, so he tries again to hit the unmoving object right below him.</p>

<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Druid is very wary of the chest at the altar. He's feeling the panic of the situation closing in upon him. He walks back away from the mesmerizing crystals. And begins to line up toward the chest.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter walks towards the chest, he sees the egg is now shaking a little.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He stays about 15 feet away and sends a blast of flame at it.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Flame erupts from the druid and heads toward the altar.  It explodes, and as it does, the fire is drawn into the egg-shaped icon.  It grows in size, slightly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The beating and clicking get louder.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>There's nothing for it. He's going to tempt the fate of the egg. He steps a few feet further back and sends out another jet of flame.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, sir, I'm bushed too!  I'll ramp it back up tomorrow.  Have a great night, sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You too dude. I’m interested to see what kind of draconic abomination wants to come out of that egg lol.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hehehehehe...)</p><p>(I've been doing some work on Monday's game, too.  Fun stuff ahead!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(i’m really excited for it. it’s been ramping up big time lately!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Honestly...  I was scratching my head about what the hell was going to happen and what to do afterwards.  It feels like there are 300 options, and I just can't plan for all of that!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gout of flame speeds towards the altar.  Again, the same happens.  The magic is wholly swallowed by the egg-shaped item on the table.  It grows again.  The beating and clicking get louder still.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm, I wonder...”, mutters The Deleter.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He sends a shard of ice to blast over at the ticking egg.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Ice erupts from the druid's hands, forming a spike.  It careens towards the object of his ire, but it looks like it's going to miss by at least a foot or so...  then the particles of magic that created the spike atomize, all of it being sucked into the now burgeoning egg-shape.  It tilts a little on it's stand.  The chest is also moving, seemingly trying to get away from the item on the altar.  The beating is getting frantic, as is the clicking.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The egg has now grown to the size of a large watermelon.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Now trying to think of anything to coax this egg into opening without enlarging anymore, he blurts out one of the only words he knows in this language. “<i>Sungovall...</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The egg tilts and buckles, but not from the words.  It is growing again.  As Dieter speaks the foreign word, grinding stone is heard behind him.  The door in the curved wall is opening.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Shit! Shit! Shit!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Sungovall!” He tries again now to get the door to close, if indeed that’s how it works. He’s starting to panic now.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door stops several inches open.  A <i>whooshing</i> sound emanates from the dark room beyond.  The egg-shape wobbles dangerously on the pedestal.  The beating and clicking rise to a fever pitch.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, streaks of blood can be seen coming from Jaecob's ears.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter resigns himself to what must be done. He runs over and picks up the egg, trying to open it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Picking up the egg, battling the noise and the nausea that threatens to undo him, Dieter grips the egg-shape in two and and <i>rips</i>!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Because it is growing, the shell hasn't been able to keep up with the growth.  Seen now up close, it is scaly, hot to the touch, and Dieter can even see an appendage poking out, trying to break free from the inside.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The egg's skin is stretched to the breaking point.  As Dieter grips the sides, a small clawed arm comes up and out of the top!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Dieter takes ancillary damage as egg goo splashes on him.  As he drops the egg, the whole thing splatters and breaks on the ground.  Inside, a writhing animal tries to right itself and stand.  The thing is a mass of tentacles, appendages, claws, and scales.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The being is half baby dragon, half mind flayer.  Its face is a mass of tentacles, its beady eyes search out for one of its kind.  The voices have abated since the door has opened, but ever since the dragon-flayer has emerged, you can pick up its birthing cries telepathically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(thanks! he did not for the last window.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter immediately loses all sense of fear at seeing the baby animal, his druidic roots coming to the fore. He begins to lock eyes with it and tries to tend to it as best he can. He speaks to it softly and offers it some water.</p>

<p>The baby, wet and scrabbling for purchase, looks up at Dieter.  Cocking its head, it tries to understand.  Seeing the waterskin, he cocks its head to the other side, reminding Dieter a bit of a newborn puppy.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(By the way, looks like this, but smaller:)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
“Flayco.” He names the whelp. He pulls out a piece of his rations and puts it on the ground in front of it, then pours a bit of water next to it. “Eat. Drink. (And be scary :P)”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Flayco's tentacles creep over the water, and the baby <i>sloughs</i> over to it to drink.  While drinking, an errant tentacle searches out for the rations.  It wraps around the food, and immediately, passes it over in search of other nibbles.  It finishes with the water, opens its eyes, and blinks; first one eye, then the other, then both together.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then it sees the unconscious Jaecob on the floor.  It cocks its head...  and moves toward the prone man.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(What it might grow up to look like?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(that model is awesome.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter rushes over and gets in between Flayco and Jaecob. “No!” He sternly gestures with a raised finger. “We’ll find you summat else to eat Flayco.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Shelli, trembling, moves into her Shell Defense.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Remembering the black dragon whelp and the pantry, Dieter begins thinking about next steps while he awaits Flayco’s response.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The baby dragon cocks its head at Dieter, not quite understanding.  Shelli is so large, the illithi-dragon doesn't understand it to be a being.  However, it turns back to it's quarry in Jaecob and tries to move around Dieter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Animal handling check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(With advantage!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It holds off as Dieter goes to block it's path, however.  It looks up, curiously.  Small tentacles reach out towards the druid.  A small, circular mouth rimmed with tiny teeth is at the center where the tentacles connect with the baby dragon's face.  It coos, eerily.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter thinks hard. He beckons the fledgling to follow him toward the door. As he approaches he glances at one of the gems and gets an idea. He picks one up, bracing for the pain, and holds it up at arms length to Flayco. "Do you know what this is baby?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The baby cocks its head to the side again, staring at the pretty pink-purple gem.  It's beating too, although soundlessly.  It flashes slightly, catching the baby's beady eyes.  The dragon lets out a coo that turns into a shrill shriek that turns into a hyena-type click/laughing.  It turns its head to look back and Jaecob, then turns back to the crystal.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tosses the crystal through the crack in the door trying to lure Flayco out and away from Jaecob.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The crystal <i>plinks</i> through the crack and into the other room, landing lightly on the floor.  Flayco meanders over to the door, taking another look back at Jaecob, longingly.  As the dragon peeks into the room, it rears, then starts backing away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What is it Flayco?”, Dieter sidles over and fingers his ring going invisible and peeking through the crack.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’m really getting a kick out of treating this abomination like a puppy dog.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm about a second from a Baltimore Ravens joke...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dieter is feeling the mixture of the Druidic roots, the Draconic call, and the deep desire to upset and divert any of the machinations going on here.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(please....go onnnnnn....)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter peeks into the room.  It is pitch black everywhere but a little patch of pink-purple glow.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gotta wait for it...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter tries to slooooooowly close the stone doors.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes a peek back to make sure his new...whatever it is...is not eating Jaecob.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door doesn't move at all.  The dragon baby is still shaking it's head, but when it stops, it's searching for food.  Jaecob.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Druid’s mind is doing circles. He comes back over to Jaecob and shakes him a bit. “Jaecob! Jaecob! Wake up! It’s Dieter! Your mind is here in this world!........I’ve got ale!”</p>

<p>(Medicine check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There needs to be a magical cure to take him out of this state.  The baby dragon's tentacles starts meandering over Jaecob's feet.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here! Eat this!”, Dieter exasperatedly throws one last chunk of snake meat that he had somehow missed earlier when feeding Shelli. “Just stay clear of this man!”</p>

<p>It backs away, frightened, it's feelings hurt.  It comes over to Dieter after a few moments, trying to make amends.  The tentacles strain to find Dieter's hand for comfort.  An errant one stretches for Jaecob.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Now now Flayco, I’m sorry I hit you with that. My hand was a bit shaky and...Don’t Eat Jaecob! He’s a friend. Friiiieeeeennnndd. F. R. I. E. N. D. Friend. Got it?” He gives a reassuring rub on the top of the whelp’s head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It gives the high pitched squeal that settles to a purr.  (Gotta start calling Dieter Flacco from now on...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a clanking that comes from the chest, the clicking has taken a strange cast.  Probably because it's been going crazy for so long.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We’ll go find some tasty thief for you pup, there’s plenty to go around. No Jaecob though y’hear?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He gives a stern two-eyed stare back at the beast and points two fingers at his own eyes, the rotates them back and forth between he and it. He then proceeds over to the chest and gives it an inspection.</p>

<p>Dieter looks into the chest to find a human heart.  Which is still beating, thanks to the workings of a small object.  Dieter blinks.  Blinks again.  He could swear it looks just like a goldfish.  In a small sphere.  On closer inspection, it is just that.  A clockwork fish swimming and floating, helping the heart continue it's macabre beating.</p>

He wonders is the good folks over at Bags of Holding Inc.™️ have added a soundproofing feature, then supposed he’ll find out soon enough, at any rate this one is value all the way. He tightens the pack back up then calls to his menagerie. “Time to move out!” He knocks on Shelli’s shell and beckons her out. “Hey there girl, I need you to do me a solid. Can you carry out friend here?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He assumes whatever “Blaaaalkkkeee” means is some form of snail assent and begins to load Jaecob’s prone body onto the Flail Snail, hoping the shell is comfortable enough to ride but not enough to sleep.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter turns around and sees Flayco nibbling on Jaecob's head.</p>

<p>Dieter hears a disgusting <i>slurpp</i> as the baby dragon peels itself off of Jaecob.  It's beady eyes lock on to the sphere and he scrabbles after it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter shouts, “That’s my good boy!”, then turns to examine the fresh would on his incapacitated friend with the increasingly inconvenient illithid ingestion injury.</p>

<p>The hair on top of his head is now matted with blood.  There is a small tracing of marks around the crown of his head, but it looks like this was too big of a quarry for the little illithi-dragon.  Still, Muhlen is not looking great.  He is still stable, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ok kids, time to go!” He beckons Shelli, with the blighted man on her back, over to the door and searches around for the scrabbling Flayco, “Here boy! Time to go find some meat!” </p><p>He marches determinedly toward the stone door. </p><p>“<i>Sungovall</i>...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door starts opening again.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The motley crew shuffles, schlurps, and scampers through the door. Dieter eyes the scene cautiously and moves to the other magical door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just to clarify, you're heading through the already open door in the curved wall?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(was heading back out into the main chamber and taking a look at the South door.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're headed back to the chamber with the banners and columns?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(looking at the map i guess i was in the south room already? i wanted to go to the Svankigare door.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(maybe i got those words flipped at some point?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ah yes. i did.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(west door then.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yeah, no worries!  You guys were already in the S room, but when you said the other magical word, a door on the curved wall opened.  You wouldn't have to exit back to the main chamber to get to the W room/area.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ah ok. That changes things then. Let me retcon that for a second.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(so many doors!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter leads the menagerie to the curved wall, amazed at his dumb luck in the accidental linguistic limbo he’s be meandering through. He produces a flame to light the way, bracing for the impending psychic itch.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stone door opens inward on the group, they all wait with bated breath to see the room beyond.  <i>Scraaaaape</i> The stone leaves a groove on the dusty floor.  By the light of Dieter's flame, he can view a circular room, unlit but with ready torches ensconced in the walls.  A few tattered tents are set up, but the main feature is a circular pit in the center of the room.  Dark clouds rage and roll in a pit, shadow lightning arcs and crackles without sound or light.  Above this miasma, as if floating atop it, looks to be a clay disc of sorts.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the druid moves around the room, careful not to get too close to the pit, he can see more of their surroundings.  There are several tables set up as workbenches.  Various items are strewn about, most of them used in some form of herbalism or construction aspects.  There is a large stone structure on the W side of the wall.  In front of it is a strange cylinder, set on its side, with four vertical sections with strange glyphs on them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Kinda like this, but in four equal sections.  And slightly less metallic!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gonna afk with fam for a bit. will post here and there!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter sends his flame over to the nearest sconce and lights one of Jaecob’s torches from the resulting flame, moving around the room to light the rest. He snuffs out the torch he is holding and stows it back into Jaecob’s pack. He uses the resulting light to investigate all the markings in the room and to inspect the herbs for anything that might help his companion, as well as general healing and alchemical reagents.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The lights ignite in their sconces one by one as Dieter traverses the room.  The last one is lit and the group can see the details of the work spaces.  Various herbs and accoutrement are scattered hither and yon, nothing looks fresh or even edible at this point.  Sticks can be seen sticking out of what presumably was a shrub or tree, all of it desiccated now.  There is a thrum in the air, and Dieter notices it gets more intense as he gets nearer the clay disc in the center of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes similar precautions to the last room casting his spell of detection.</p>

<p>(For Shelli’s tentacles, should I just count the Long Rests as the reset/day or do you want to cue me for those when it’s appropriate since i can’t see the sun?)</p>

<p>(The long rests will set as our 'days', that sounds good.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are pings from the detect magic spell.  The cryptex in front of the stone structure gives off abjuration magic.  The disc is giving off the greatest magic signature he's ever experienced.  It threatens to overwhelm Dieter.  Abjuration plus another school he can't define are emanating from the disc.  The miasma is abjuration mixed with heavy evocation magics.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes time to inspect the glyphs on the cryptex with great care, hovering and tracing his fingers over the shapes about two inches away from the object.</p>

<p>Dieter opens the sack.  Inside he finds various gems worth 1,000 gp collectively.  He also finds a filigreed bowl with waves, aquatic life, and ocean scenes etched in silver.  Lastly, there is a black book that is bound with a leather thong, tied tightly in the front.</p>

<p>Flayco did not bring the sphere back.  (That doesn't mean he didn't find it, however...)</p><p>Dieter reads through the book, really taking his time to try and decipher the writing.  After a handful of pages, he can definitely tell this was Lord Muhlen's.  It looks like the wizard was trying to piece together the language of the illithids, known as Qualith.  The writing is more of a textural representation of emotions and larger concepts than actual words specifically.  Lord Muhlen notes that humanoids are not able to read Qualith, or else they could go mad.  Needless to say, the last few pages were his tests into deciphering the code to the cryptex.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Excerpt: *To open the vault in the west edifice, four vertical options must be chosen.  The goal is to open the vault, so the emotions and concepts must coincide with the ultimate goal.  There are six options on each vertical rotor.  The first should be the concept of earth or enclosed space.  The second should be a lock, or barrier.  The third should be freeing.  Last should be the emotion of fulfillment.  I was able to find the first, but the headaches came back with a vengeance and I was unable to complete anything more that day.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes the items in hand and looks over the cryptex once more, now taking in all the shapes. He retreats toward the door and attempts to close it with a word. He then beckons Flayco over and tries to get him to settle. He has a mind to sit down and meditate on these writings for awhile before he takes it a step further...</p>

<p>Dieter lays his hands on Jaecob.  A golden glow, tinged with a little aquamarine blue, surrounds the two.  The glow abates, and Jaecob slooowly opens his eyes.  He blinks;  Looks around.  Sees Flayco on the ground, trying to get up on Shelli.  The baby dragon sits back down and scratches the back of its head with a hind leg.  It then tries to hop back onto Shelli, still trying to get up.  Jaecob's eyes go <i>very</i> wide.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Jaecob! You’re awake! Fear not...this is <i>Flayco</i>. He’s one of us now. I’ll explain more later. Here, take this...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here, I saved the last for you.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He accepts the bottle but cannot take his eyes, his <i>wide</i> eyes, away from the monster on the ground.</p><p>"Fa... fa....  F....    Flayco, ye say?"  He paused a beat, taking it all in.  "Nice name, that."  He looks towards Dieter.  </p><p>"What in the fucking Nine Hells did I miss?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Well, you...kind of...blacked out. That chest in the last chamber was an ooze monster which we laid low, and the golden egg there, well...it turns out it was Flayco. </p><p></p><p>I’m sorry, this must all seem a bad dream, and believe me, I’m on the verge myself, but, I could not leave a whelp uncared for. What with the dread power hunger of your father, along with his spirit’s captivity at the hands of the illithids and your usurper brother, I feel we must do everything in our power to resist! </p><p></p><p>It would seem this poor creature was bred for one purpose. I plan to undo that. I will take what energies our foes have pooled and whirl them back one-hundred fold with the wrath of scorned, the enmity of the exiled! </p><p></p><p>Just think...you, me, poor Shelli, and indeed perhaps most of all wretched Flayco here are castaways. Bastards of circumstance.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Somewhere in the back of Dieter's mind, he feels the pull of his friend Maouelue.  He imagines his friend giving the same kind of speech, wherever he might be.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

Jaecob looks to Dieter. "We <i>have</i> to get out of this place, Dieter.  Besides my deranged brother's minions and the flayers, there are horrible abominations.  Like, from the Abysss abominations..."  He looks around, starting to get frantic.  His eyes alight on the illithi-dragon.  Softly, he whispers, "They could be anywhere."</p>

<p>Dieter holds out the large staff to Jaecob, and together they help span the deadly pit.  The miasma is almost completely gone now, the disc is hovering just a few inches off of the ground.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Flayco hops on and starts traversing.  Halfway over, he gets the disc in his tentacles and continues crossing towards Jaecob.  Dieter, however, looks down and sees red eyes looking back and him.  The staff wavers...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Careful there now lads!" The leverage of the wyrmling on the end of the staff tests the Druid's strength as his eyes peer downward.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter strokes the grotesque, yet oddly cuddly, crossbreed lovingly. "You did good there boy, reaaaal good!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The miasma evaporates as the disc moves from the top.  Jaecob peers into the darkness.  Many sets of red eyes stare back at him, from the deep recesses.  Could it be rats?  Fey creatures?  The abyssal monsters he fears most?</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He buckles down and fights his fear, but the roiling blackness shows him no more...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter closes his eyes, taps into his druidic roots, finds the flow.  The water in his mind washes over him, turns to dust and grit as a small child grabs him by the hand, leads him to an ancient pyramid somewhere amidst massive sand dunes.  They walk through the massive entry way, make their way deep, deeper into the darkening rooms.  Finally, the last room has a shaft of light illuminating a small disc on a plinth.  The disc that Dieter is holding now.  Instantly, as his mind-self reaches out and touches the object, both entities are flooded with ancient knowledge about the inescapably unique artifact...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(More in a few, afk for a bit.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
***Annulus:** This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the Annulus is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.

The Annulus is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As Dieter grasps the object a burst of low frequency energy seems to blast inward, momentarily silencing the ambience around him. He both feels and hears a static sizzle lingering in the air around him as he rebounds back into the full sonic plane. Immediately, he turns to Flayco and casts a careworn look in his direction, fearing the worst.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Annulus generates a continuous catapsi (nullified psionic field) effect within a 30-foot-radius of the wielder.</p><p>The wielder gains a +4 bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals psionic damage.</p><p>Once per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action.  (Redirects psionic damage back onto the attacker.)</p><p>As a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to dimensional anchor that affects all psionic-based creatures in a 50-foot radius.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yes. Please.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter, seeing that his pup is ok, examines the disc deeply. “Yes. Yeeeeeessssss.” He mutters under his breath.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What’s down there Jaecob?”, He sidles up to the edge.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You... ah..."  He looks gravely at you.  "You don't want to know."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Tremendous sucking sounds start up from the depths, as if some lumbering creature were slinking up the pit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(perception on dieter since he’s staring down there too now?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter looks deep into the pit.  With his newfound weapon, he is feeling confident.  Ready to tackle <i>anything</i> that might threaten his family.  Jaecob lights a torch quickly, needing to see better.  What they see is a black pile of ooze, covered in red eyes and viscous looking mouths, using it's black tentacles to reach and push itself up the sides of the pit.  It's slowly coming up, but it just might be gaining some momentum.  The mouths are all saying something, all at the same time.  Gibbering, shouting, cursing, whispering, all happening at the same time.  Some laugh, and high-pitched cackling echoes throughout the area.  Worse yet, the eyes seems to be locked onto the now lit torch.  A roar/hiss/groan/laugh screams out at the duo.</p>

<p>Taking it's extended dash action, it will move another 20 feet, just to the mouth of the pit.  Everyone can now see the disgusting sight of the creature.  It appears bodies of drow, illithid, and a myriad of other denizens of the underdark were boiled down and reassembled, poorly, into a mass of flesh, muscles, and viscous liquid.  The thing roils around, but seems to have appendages it can manifest at will.  Constant chattering and gibbering come from it, causing all of the party to get confused, the voices rattling around in your heads.  As it gets closer, you all can see the stone of the pit is quickly turning soft, mushy.  </p><p>(Mechanics - Wisdom save at the start of each turn, DC 10.  If you fail, roll a d8.  The floor around the creature in a 10ft radius is difficult terrain, which covers everybody at this time - with the exception of maybe Shelli.  To move, strength check, DC 10.  On a fail, movement is zero.  I'll update Roll20 asap.  Morning!!!  And welcome to HELL!!!! 😆)</p>

<p>(The way I'm reading it, any creature within the range has to make a wis save - maybe we skipped over that for the rest of the party, but a bunch of people standing around does not a combat make!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(interesting. I think it reads as two rounds because it is effectively two of shelli's turns, so that way it doesn't end before everyone has come around. It ends at after her next turn is how I read it)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It has the 2 rounds on there, and it couldn't take reactions or move or anything.  I think you might be correct, he shouldn't be able to do anything until the end of his turn because this is his second round with it on.  But the automation clearly said it's the start of the 2nd round.  Which doesn't make too much sense, honestly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Your interpretation would make the automation act correctly, so maybe that's the RAW?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(By the way, I love this!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So, I think the stun happens in round 1, round 1 ends, now we have 1 round of stun left. we go through everyone and after shelli's turn, the stun ends. Seems right.)</p>

<p>Flayco is having a jolly old romp of excitement between the two, making all sorts of squelching flapping noises. Shelli, hearing a thrum of revelry, takes a tentative peek out of her shell, which rapidly accelerates, well...as rapidly as a Flail Snail can....into a bobbing lurch that can only be interpreted as ecstasy.</p>

<p>(Classic!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Reeling in the crew, Dieter calls for calm, then directs everyone over to the pit. They all look down at the darkness. Dieter brings over what remains of the flaming sphere and lets it fall down the hole, watching as its light illuminates all it passes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shadows are cast as the sphere shrinks slightly, passes by the group, and heads down the hole in the middle of the room.  Immediately, the crew sees flotsam of the creature clinging to the sides all the way down.  The sphere travels thirty feet, forty feet, it still continues on.  The sides farther down seem less disgusting, and Dieter and Jaecob can almost make out flagstones.  The sphere continues down, down, it becomes a pinpoint of light no longer under the control of Dieter.  There is stays, but the group is unsure whether it is at the bottom, or just disconnected from the druid.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter can't quite make out the sequencing of the cryptex.  The book made it sound pretty simple, but looking at it now, it's anything but.  He can, however, touch the spinning columns and turn them without any of the adverse effects referenced by Lord Muhlen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Pinned a message.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I was thinking about how to do this mechanically.  How about, since you have the book, you have advantage on the rolls, but the DC gets higher to guess the right one.  Straight d20 rolls, column 1 DC 3, col 2 DC 8, column 3 DC 13, column 4 DC 17?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He deliberates over the spindles, examining each and every glyph upon them, searching for the resonances Muhlen referred to.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Could do that, or if you have pictures etc, I could try to guess. Fine with either)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I don't have any pics, but I could try to find some.  This is a from-the-hip idea.  The idea is Dieter would have really no idea about the written language, but the feeling was supposed to give him the clue.  He would have had to touch the glyphs, do a con save, and see how far he could go.  Jaecob can help, or run that process, but with the Annulus, Dieter can't get the vibe of the glyph meaning.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(gotcha. I guess, My approach would be mathematical if I were Dieter. Like 6<i>6</i>6</p><p></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It'll be a roll-off?  You're trying to get within 5 to get it, and you'll have 2 chances to get it?  Or would you prefer to hit a DC?  I'll have a better puzzle for you later, I promise!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The journal mentions that Muhlen found the first symbol. Can Dieter any indication of which it was? Is there any chance of gleaning more from these incoherent writings? There is an itching curiosity to find more clues. How did Muhlen</i> </p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just thinking this feels like something to figure out rather than leave up to chance)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sure, Jaecob could help/aid.  He could give you a + to the roll?  Or you're thinking he could study his father's writings and glean something?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(More along the lines of the latter, or checking to see whether his <i>gift</i> gives him any latent insight, perhaps that he has repressed out of trying to rid himself of the power. IDK. I know there were other side chambers I haven't gone into yet too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "Here, Jaecob, come stand inside the circle here." He holds up the Annulus. "This will keep you sane, I promise. Can you make anything out of your father's writings? Feel your inner Runemark, as you are the true bearer, more aware of the powers of temptation than your he who was overtaken by his lust. Please...search within...."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>"Ha! Safe!...Pardon my hearty guffaw there Jaecob, but when's the last time you felt <i>safe</i>... But I saw that blood in your eyes today. Aren't you <i>ready to know what your old man was after?</i> Wouldn't it be sweet to beat your brother to it? <i>If only to burn it all down...</i>"</p>

<p>Jaecob deftly rolls the columns, looking at the book for reference.  The first clicks into place, then the second and third.

<p>(I want to do this justice, and I'm completely beat sir, I'm sorry.  I'll leave it on a cliffhanger, but I'll bring it up first thing tomorrow, I'm working early so I'll be on around 8.  Have a great night, buddy!)</p>

<p>Stone grinds against stone, but no dust is made.  It seems this craftsmanship is very high end.  The smell is the first thing the group notices.  It is tangy, rotten, with notes of brine and the sea.  The irregularly shaped room is lined with tables and bookshelves.  A magical lamp crackles to life to illuminate a truly grizzly scene.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On the table is an illithid, dead, in mid-post mortem.  It's chest has an incision down to his waist, the skin is splayed open and tacked to the table, presenting the innards of the creature.  The table beyond the operating bench is filled with gadgets and tools, all caked in dried blood and gristle.  Several books are opened on the surrounding shelving, including one standing open on a high stand close to the operation.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Stifling a retch, the two humans cover their faces with whatever means they can as they enter. Dieter sets a flame outside the door to draw out and purify the sickly air. Immediately Dieter begins looking for an internal door mechanism.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On the left side of the interior wall of the chamber, Dieter sees clearly a stone button trying to blend into the stone.  Just underneath that is a wooden switch, prominently stationed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I know it’s not much, but it’s home for now. Let’s close this up and take a rest while we sort through these tomes.” Dieter makes to close the outer door to the pit chamber and to seal the cryptex door using the hidden stone button, once they’ve aired things out as best they can that is.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>He settles in for a long, restful read.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Seems like a good spot to ask - stay with Dieter, or catch up with Maouelue?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah i think flashing over is the idea here while they study.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Cool, let me check up and remind myself where we left off!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
*Summary: Maouelue and new-found friend Daran the ranger went to Oakhurst and joined up with friends there.  After seeing the devastation wrought on the town, Maouelue garnered the forces of the people left.  Some have decided to strike out for the Sunless Citadel, while others were headed to local towns to gather support for their battle against the Runemark.  The last we left our adventurers, they were in Bellatrix's home.  She had just answered the door on an old woman with bone white hair, clutching a carpet bag...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Sister?" Bellatrix says, incredulously.  "You're supposed to be at home.  In bed, resting!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"BAH," the crone spits.  "There's adventure afoot, and I mean to see to it that none of you break your gods-damned necks!"  She hobbles in on a gnarled cane/staff and immediately ventures towards the herbalism table.  Setting her things down hastily, she starts her brewing, getting items and preparing bottles and vials.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks dumbfounded at the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Welcome Sister, to our fellowship.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Is this the Ilmater crone from way back?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It is not, but you have met her before.  Never spoken to her, but seen her for sure.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The woman yells over her shoulder, "'Bout time I did something <i>useful</i>!  Been wastin' away all these years.  Feel like a new woman!  We gotta get going, though, if we're going to be gettin' anywhere useful.  Gods, woman," she says to Bellatrix, "Don't you have a cauldron of healing potion ready <i>at alll times</i>?  What have I always said!  Gods!!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “I’m afraid if our previous encounters have been anything to go by, we *will* need a vat of the old healing brew...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She <i>cackles</i> from the corner, good naturedly but with an edge to it, for sure.  "Never enough, that's what they say!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Small crackles and pops start emanating from the cauldron.  The woman says, "Don't mind me, get along with your business.  I'll be ready by the time you's are ready to get-along!  Aheh!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Daran, I would like to come back to the barrrow by an alternate route. Let us traverse what we may of the rift along the way. Is there aught we should know before heading into the forest?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't suggest going into the rift.  Or travelling along it, either.  Bound to be traversed by Runemark men.  Best way I can see is stealing through this forest.  It's not the safest route, but it might be the most direct.  You want to get back to near the place we met, yes?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye, you’re my guide from here to there as far as I’m concerned. I’ll follow your lead. Long have I wished to see the fabled woods of my kin.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Of course, there is...  one...  other way."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Especially if you want to see kin."  He gets a faraway look, as if he's a million miles away.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s eyes glisten with starlight as he stares in anticipation.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran comes back to himself, coughs, and grips the back of his neck with his hand.  "I.."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't like talking about it, much.  Reminds me of..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Better times.  But some time ago, I was a part of a group that was charged with protecting a mythallar.  I was given the powers of a walker.  Gods, I haven't used them in forever.  But I might be able to remember how.  Could take us to a separate plane, maybe even the feywild.  We could go to the barrow, then planeshift back.  Might even meet some eladrin in the process."   He looks extremely embarrassed to be speaking about any of this.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old woman has stopped her work and is gawking at the ranger.  So are the others, as if Daran is some deified being.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...the Eladarin...”, Maouelue mutters in a hushed whisper.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Just another option.  I'm fine with any way we go."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue thinks back to what drew him here in the first place. A view of his final encounter with Shi’Vandos begins to coalesce in his mind’s eye...</p><p></p><p><i>His old master, ever patient with the impetuousness of youth, yet ever watchful, glances over at his young charge, lost in his studies. As always Maouelue sits there hunched over his studies of ancient lore and language, his back to the window and the distracting echoes of his cohort frolicking out in the midsummer sun. He uses the latter instead to illuminate his texts late into the day.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Shi’Vandos knows that drive, that yearning for something greater than oneself, and nowhere could be more compelling than these old stories. Yet the stories themselves were all an illusion if one never got out of the tower. Yes, this land of Faerun is fabled beyond all, but as the hours in the tower grow long the flower of the power wanes.</i></p><p></p><p><i>“Maouleue,” the elder starts, “Come now, the time for reading today is done.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>The young elf looks up imploringly from his book, glancing back at the last unread page.</i></p><p></p><p><i>The master stifles a chuckle and nods. “Yes, you can finish it.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>Relieved, Maouleue buries himself back in and furiously scans over the final words, taking a long deep breath as he closes the tome’s back cover and holds it between his hands. He rises slowly and ritually restores the book to its place on the shelf.</i></p><p></p><p>“It is time we put all of this knowledge you are so keen to accumulate to use. Come, follow me to the observatory, I must show you something.”</p><p></p><p><i>“Of course, master.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>Shi’vandos leads him solemnly down a series of ornate corridors lined with oil paintings of old masters come and gone, old glorious deeds immortalized in radiant colors, the intricate white lattice work of the elves who built this wing of the academy lining the walls and letting a moiré of light shine in on the otherwise unlit space.</i></p><p></p><p><i>They take a right turn at the end of the long hall and Shi’vandos pulls a thin lever recessed into a nook.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A door to a long winding stair opens up and the Master defers to his pupil.</i></p><p></p><p><i>”Some things you must see first for yourself.”, he states stoically.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Maoulue looks deep into his eyes, questioning, yet obedient. He turns and walks apprehensively up and around and out of view.</i></p><p></p><p><i>“Yes, you must see for yourself what I cannot bear to tell you. Not until...you have had time to let the truth of what must be done arise from your own mind.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>He waits there, patient, knowing, for an hour, listening all the while. Then he hears it, the cry of shock and agony that he knows only too well himself. He lets out a breath that perhaps he had been holding the whole time, and follows his pupil’s ascent.</i></p><p></p><p>“<i>Yes, my shining star, you have a half brother...my...other son. It is time you met him...but I am...no longer able to go that way. It is time you seek him out, and bring to him these words I would have him hear, before it is too late...”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>”Master? I did not hear you come in...</i>”</p><p></p><p>Maoulue’s conscience begins to fade back into view, he pushes against the sensation of the dark hovel returning, desperate for answers to the questions he should have asked that day, and the important words he has now forgotten...</p>

<p>“Yes, I will follow you through the plane of the Feywild. If my studies be accurate and my intuition be true, there is someone there with whom I am most anxious to speak.”</p><p></p><p>“Vam, Heston, I fear my hours with you are always too short and filled with terrible tidings and tasks, yet your roles in this may now just prove the fate of these lands. Get ye hence to Longsaddle and raise what rabble you can, though if you can muster brick and crenelation, the all the better! We will need loyalty above all. Let us each swear now here upon the light of the lost that we shall prevail amidst the darkness and never despair. Let us meet on the field nigh the dark citadel ere the holy light wanes and stake our standards of truth deep in the soil, letting our banners fly to the wind off the Trackless Sea.”</p><p></p><p>With this, he traces a frozen sigil in the air, one of peace, resolution and above all, balance. He nods at the group and turns his gaze to the sisters of the craft. </p><p></p><p>“I would beg no further favor of you two, yet I welcome whatever aid our cause can afford.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The women wait patiently for the men to say goodbye to Maouelue and Dieter, then say goodbye themselves.  After Vam and Heston leave, the old lady turns back to her work, Bellatrix goes to help.  The old woman says to her sister (but loud enough for all to hear), "It's been a while since I've seen it, but I think we're in the presence of honest-to-gods <i>ta'veren</i>, Bella."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The two women gather all of their progress into a few side satchels, and hands one out to each member.  Bellatrix says, "Inside these are two potions of healing, one standard and one greater.  A potion of invisibility, a potion of water-breathing, and two potions of fire resistance.  I'm not sure what else we need, so I'm brining along all I can to help make more on our way."  As she hands a bag to Maouelue, she blushes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Thank you <i>dear Bellatrix</i>”, He bows deeply.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old woman cackles a bit, and shuffles off muttering to herself.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran is searching in his pack.  He brings out a strange metal symbol or device of some sort.  He arranges it in the center of the room, moves furniture and clears a space.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue focuses all his attentions on the object, on the precipice of the realm of which til now he had only read in old musty tomes alone in a tower leagues away, eras away. He waits with bated soul.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for bedtime. Right back!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I should tell you all, before we start on this path, the Feywild...  Well, time there is different.  It'll seem like time is passing normally.  But when we get back, it could be seconds, minutes, hours...  even years off.  I know I mentioned it as an option, and I don't have anything here worth living or dying for.  But you all might.  Just wanted to put everything on the table with what we're about to do."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I am ready.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Belltrix grabs Maouelue's hand.  "I am ready."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Giggling, the old woman grabs Bellatrix's hand.  "I'm ready, too!"  She holds out a hand for Daran.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“How about you, Daran?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shouldering his pack, he stands, grasps the other's hands.   He closes his eyes and the room starts spinning around them.  It blurs as the object in the middle of the group shines a bright yellow.  The floor falls away, the walls fall away, Daran opens his eyes.   Black pools look out from his sockets.  He raises his head, mouthing words unheard.  Winds still spin around the group.  Vaguely, colors come back to the void.  Beautiful pinks and purples mix with lush and vibrant greens and yellows.  Dark brown woods come into view.  Interspersed, violet flowers that look mixed with fireworks and glitter about in the forest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Birds tweet in the trees, random noises indicate small woodland creatures scurry underfoot and overhead.  It smells of fresh soil and a cool breeze plays throughout the group.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran takes a deep breath and smiles.  Bellatrix and the old woman do the same.  They all look around, taking in their new surroundings.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue fairly swoons as the pages of his devotion are spread out, in the flesh, all around him. The chroma of colors swirls into his eyes and stirs deep chords within this spirit. He stumbles slightly over to Daran and falls into a weighty hug that turns into spurts of sobbing. </p><p></p><p>“The beauty....it’s more than i ever imagined...listen to the song of the birds! I....I...”</p><p></p><p>Words fail the overwhelmed elf.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran pats Mao's back.  "I know.  I know."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(let’s call it there for today. feels like a great spot to pick up from.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sounds great, sir!  Welcome to the Feywild!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Woooohooo!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They de-embrace, still looking at their surroundings, taking it all in.  The sisters are doing the same.  Daran eventually picks up the object from the ground and, putting it in his pack, picks out something else and starts walking in a wide circle around the group, holding the item out before him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue’s academic mind kicks in. He studied Daran’s movements with a trained eye, determined to glean everything he can from this experience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Inv or perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran notices Maouelue intently watching him.  He says, not turning away from his circling, "The Feywild is one of two planes that directly overlap the material plane.  Natural landmarks mimic themselves across these veils, as do cities and even people, sometimes.  This compass is a way for me to get my bearings down.  If I'm to lead us to where we need to be, I need to be as close to where we first met in the material plane.  Then we can cross back.  If we do so before, who knows where we might end up."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and be wary of the foods here.  Might be best if I check them first."</p>

<p>(Perception for  the group, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Birds chirp, leaves scuttle.  The late-evening sun streams through the trees casting rays of light throughout.  It is utter bliss for Maouelue, who feels he has returned home.  Daran nods, looks off in a direction East/SE, scanning through the trees.  Moments later, satisfied with his assessment, he shoulders his pack and says, "Are we ready to go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes,” Maouelue says, bringing himself around. “It is time we were on our way.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Since Daran is leading the group and has pretty good survival skills, to make it interesting, we're going to do group survival checks.  The time of day when you left the material plane, I believe, was morning/mid-day.  The travel will more than likely take a full day, according to Daran.  If you don't get waylaid to badly, that is!  The approximate distance is 30 miles, which means six checks.  We'll do them one at a time.  Roll for Maouelue, and two more separate r20s for Bellatrix and the old woman.  I'll roll for Daran and we'll see where we are!)</p>

<p>Not but five steps into the long trek, four figures descend down from the high tree boughs.  Unheard, unseen until just now, these elves have pale white skin, almost like it is frosted over.  Their long hair is bluish white, tied back by intricate baubles that look to be glass or ice.   Their clothes are dark blues and whites, and with the surrounding woods, take on a greenish tint as well.  They all hold strong looking, but delicately beautiful bows.  Two of them, in the rear of the foursome, have lethal looking arrows nocked.  The other two stare daggers at Daran and Maouelue respectively.  In a deeply sonorous, mournful tone, an androgynous looking one closest to the party steps forward, bow at their side, and says, "You are trespassing in our home, the Glimmerwood.  As you do not seem to be from Faerie, you will have to explain yourselves.  It is unwise to be here without a winter eladrin scout."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue’s mind races back too all the books he ever read on the Eldarin, frantically trying to think of something that would save them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He searches Daran pleadingly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran holds his hands out. "Please accept our deepest apologies.  My name is Daran Edermath, son of Yanoros Edermath, of the Imperios Ralohorn bloodline.  I am a Horizon Walker, one of the called protectors of Myth Evereska.  These here are under my safeguard.  We are traversing the Feywild in hopes to defeat a newly arrived doom to Faerun.  There is much need for us to make haste through your realm, I apologize sincerely for the intrusion."</p><p>(Did Mao want to add anything?)</p>

<p>The elves look between each other, then size up the group again.  The lead elf raises his arm, moves it slightly behind him.  They say, "Cruiver, Otirnis, lower your bows."  Without any of them taking their eyes off you, their weapons are lowered.  </p><p>"Hear this, Master Protector of Myth Evereska, you are not welcome here.  This not your home.  Maybe the other one with you could stay if he truly wanted.  But know this - even though you have the capability of coming here, you have neither the authority or welcome to be in Faerie.  We will walk you to the closest crossing.  There you must leave our lands."  The lead two turn to move further into the forest, the other two are waiting for you to pass to take up the rear.  Daran looks sadly at Maouelue.  Softly, he says, "Sorry Maouelue.  Not the best reception for your first visit here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Errrm, ah well met ancient brethren. I pray not be too presumptuous and I fully understand your desire to defend your lands.

<p>The leader stops abruptly.  His companions do as well, the rear guard at attention.  The bows are drawn but not up.  The leader turns their head so that their voice can be heard behind them.  "I understand your need.  Both of our worlds have troubles, 'doom' to use a phrase.  It is not foreign to us.  I am sure you would have us lead you to your way point.  You may even want to petition one of our noble houses, or one of the Queens even.  However, any of these actions would be folly.  You are outsiders, as we would be in your world.  We know how outsiders are treated in your Faerun.  I believe we are treating you much to the positive by allowing you to return to your home.  Do you disagree, cousin elf?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tension is offset somewhat by the beautiful atmosphere.  Each of the pale elves, however, is a taut bundle of muscle and wariness.</p>

<p>Maouelue's impetuous outburst is quelled. He opens his mouth to speak in retort, but words and courage fail him in light of this rebuke. All he can muster is, "And so it goes." He cows his head and treads on in captivity, saddened slightly at the difference between fancy and reality.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old woman looks at the net oddly, then smiles wide.  She grabs it, tosses it around herself and Bellatrix, and the women disappear from sight.  Daran apprears taken aback for a moment, but then the thudding stops and he turns to see, 80 feet up the path...</p>

<p>Four massive, 15ft tall giants, grotesquely disfigured, emerge from the forest.  They see the scattered group and start chortling.  "Look, fellas," one says in a deep, lethargic drawl.  "We got ourselves some morsels."  The foursome start laughing and hoisting their clubs.  Slowly, they start advancing towards their prey.</p>

<p>Maouleue looks up at the unfolding scene, desperation seems to mount with each passing second, yet a stout defense they would make. For a moment the sight of the giants, drenched in snow, reminds him of the vault back in Muhlen Manor. The first revelation of the frosty avatar of giant magic, the icy ambitions of the Lord himself. Here he stands clad in these garments. He dons the helmet that he laid out at the manor, draws out his frozen sword and sends out any icy beam from the tip of the sword, straight at the hexed giant!</p>

<p>The blackness contorts and morphs, bubbling up into a massive undead dragon.  It towers over the dazed giant.  It opens it's mouth and lets out a scream that shakes the foundation of the Feywild.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The elf is still kneeling, looking abashed at Maouelue as he approaches.  "My sincerest apologies.  To you and your...  fellows,"  they breath heavily.  "I must say, your team fought extremely well against foes that have been known to ravage even the best of our fighters.  Even the half-elf fought valiantly."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Even?</i>,” Maouelue raises an eyebrow?</p>

<p>“Indeed, all fought well and were it not for all of you here, I’m sure my days would be passed. I am indebted to you all.”</p><p></p><p>As he says this, his eyes linger on Bellatrix’s.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix blushes and looks away. (Smiling?)  The old woman nods and stands up, admiring her work.   Then whips the net around her shoulders.  She does not go invisible.  </p><p></p><p>Daran is led over, helped by the woman eladrin, who is also nursing a broken right arm.  Bellatrix rushes to her, as does the old woman, and they both start healing the two warriors.  </p><p></p><p>The leader says, "My name is Erifias.  This is Otirnis.  We are Winter Eladrin, not born in  this section of the Glimmerwood, but stationed to protect it.  Our lands...  Well, as you can see, our lands are in constant peril.  Our people die daily from raids of the shadar-kai and other fell monstrosities that are crossing at will into Faerie.  It is everything we can do just to stem the tide.  Lately, though...  Something is different.  The veil.  It is thinning.  Not only here, but to your world as well."  They take a very deep breath and wince.  They're covered in bruises that are turning a beautiful dusky purple.  They would be beautiful, at least, if there wasn't so many of them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I...  am sorry for our treatment of you.  All of you."  They raise their eyes slightly towards Daran, who nods respectfully.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"And, although I hate to even ask as I know you have a mission of your own,  I would be delinquent in my duties if I didn't ask for your aid.  If you were to help us, I could take you directly to Titania, or any of the eladrin courts you would prefer to speak with.  You would have our loyalty.  As the worlds are today, that would be no small thing."  They smile at you all.  "As yours would be to us."</p>

Maouelue: "We appreciate this reconciliation greatly. Full well do we know the tribulations of politics and old resentments, yet we are just as familiar with the camaraderie begat of shared battles. If the veil is indeed thinning, it would serve us all to discover why. Though we come from different sides, I count you as my kin. Long have I wished to see the wonders of Faerie and now having set foot here, I feel that something latent in me, something only before shown to me in tomes and dreams, has awoken. 

To be sure, our quest is a grave one, and my companion, a Druid of the Sword Coast, has been taken. While I do not doubt his keen sense of survival, I worry more with each passing moment. Please let us hasten away to your council and we will speak more of the aid you require along the way.

Daran, I would also beg your council in this matter, for though old tensions be what they are, you are by birth a straddler of the veil and I would consider myself a fool to disregard your wisdom on the matter."

*Maouelue, back in his comfort zone of lofty speeches, takes care not to catch Bellatrix's eye, lest he be derailed from his thread of valor.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods at you and gets up, weakly.  He starts heading over as Erifias says, "Thank you for your kind words, cousin elf.  It does lift our spirits an elf-kin has come to see Faerie in...  well, in most of her glory, anyway.  Let us treat wounds and heal, then I will take you to our court and tell you of the land and our troubles."</p>

<p>Daran seems beat up, but generally fine.  Nothing a few healing potions won't cure.  And definitely nothing Maouelue hasn't experienced in the past.  Probably run-of-the-mill for the ranger.  As for Bellatrix, she's...  absolutely free and clear of any harm.  No bruises or cuts.  The only blood on her is smears of others' damages.  Which is...  strange.  Because Maouelue saw her get hit.  Several times.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage unstoppers one of the healing potions brewed by the Sister and offers it to Daran.</p><p></p><p>“You fought bravely Daran. I am in your debt yet again.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Thank you, Maouelue."  He takes the bottle and considers it before drinking half.  The mage watches as slices and punctures heal; Daran winces.  His posture straightens, then he gives the rest of the potion of healing to Otirnis, whose arm is in a makeshift cast.  A look passes between them, then Daran turns back to Maouelue.  "This was not what I expected.  Although, to be fair, I always expect a fight.  But this was nearly more than I was capable of.  Your company is much appreciated, in many ways."  The corner of his mouth twitches up.  And then Mao realizes, that is about as close to a smile that he's seen from the ranger.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue nods respectfully to Daran, giving him the grace of not prying any further.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He then turns to Bellatrix to examine her wounds, but upon looking, he is taken aback at the undamaged body before him. He marvels at the mysteries that seem to keep unfolding with this beguiling woman.</p><p></p><p>"My lady? You...that giant clubbed you beyond measure! How is it that you are unharmed?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles, again demurely, to all in attendance.  Then she grabs Maouelue's arm and pulls him aside, a distance from the group.  Her fingers dig into his arm, painfully, yet her face is placid calmness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Once a good 40 feet away, underneath the bough of a gorgeous willow tree, her countenance turns serious, worried.  Maouelue's elven attentions can see that she is nervous, her eyes occasionally dart around as if looking for something.  Or someone.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'm sorry for all of the cloak-and-dagger, but...  I might be in very big trouble.  That...  what happened...  at the end of the fight, with the dragon?  That..." she looks around, furtively.  "Mao, that wasn't me.  I didn't conjure that abomination."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue makes to shield their conversation from the main group by moving in front of Bellatrix with his back turned toward the rest.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't.....it wasn't you? What did you feel? What did it do to you? Your healing? Did it come from the drake?..."</p><p></p><p>He catches himself in his rush of questions, then pauses, and morphs his tone.</p><p></p><p>"You were unbelievable... I knew there was more to you than meets the eye, but....there was something else today. Something that I had not yet seen revealed. Breathtaking...."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She blushes, but still looks perturbed.  "You're pretty amazing yourself."  She moves a lock of jet black hair behind her ear.  "And yes, the healing, everything at the end...  It was like I was... inhabited."  She looks up at Maouelue, scared.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We must find some time to delve further into this mystery, yet I fear if we conspire here much longer, our hosts' newfound acceptance may once again turn to suspicion. Let us make our way with the group and find rest ere long. There is much I would discuss with you <i>in confidence</i>."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He fixes her with a soft yet penetrating gaze, then starts to offer his hands, but thinks twice and abashedly puts them away, turning back to the group.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The witch follows.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Pardon our withdrawal good fellows. There was something of a, err, private matter we needed to discuss. Pray, let us get back to the matters at hand. Is everyone quite well enough to carry on, or are any more in need of healing ministrations?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Otirnis answers, looking at Erifias, "As long as we move slowly, I am ready to leave this place.  Allow me to lead us, liege?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gonna pause there, sorry dude.  I know it's early, but I am dead at the wheel!!  I'll be on it first thing tomorrow.)</p>

That being said, I'd like to do a bit more fleshing out of the story of these guys before a big lore dump.  Feel free to post and direct some questions - fictional or otherwise!  I'll definitely respond.  But the walk to their court and the politics, the side quest, I want to develop it all a bit more so I'm not just winging the whole thing!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(For sure! I’ve definitely been feeling the split worlds phenomenon as well as I’ve been digging in to all of these campaigns. Always have to remind myself to at least leave one screw in the reality timeline 😁. It feels like a good spot to take a breath and consider the scope of this next section as both parties are in a bit of a reflective/transformational moment. Also, since you threw me the reigns on Bella for combat, maybe we should think about her past/motives a bit so I don’t completely change her character, as fun as the <i>strange tension</i> between Maouelue and her is. Hope all goes well for you today.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Thanks sir!  No worries about the combat, I wanted to make sure I'm not dominating the scene.  I do have a hazy background for her, motives, etc.  Hoping they would be threshed out in the rp and we'll have a lot more chance to do that with the travel and upcoming quests.  Absolutely loving all of this, not at all what I expected (<i>again!</i>) from the quick-start I gave you!!  Wonderful!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just a couple questions real quick since there will be a bit of time here. Do you mind if I go ahead and level up Maouelue at this point and reset or should I wait for a rest? Also, I'm looking at the 3rd level spells he can get and am thinking that a variation of Melf's Minute Meteors would be dope with the Platinum Triumvirate that he crafted. I think it would mostly work the same but he would be able to recover them afterwards. LMK what you think. Cause...I could always just take fireball too haha. I just love the idea of this metal mage with an atomic structure of frozen orbs floating around him and there don't seem to be any good icy damage spells at level 3.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm good with all of that!  I remember playing a video game as a kid with a player character with orbs floating around them...  damned if I can't think of the name though.  <i>Great</i> visual, by the way!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group at large takes time to regenerate and renew their energies.  Amazingly, the ealdrin, Maouelue, and even Daran seem to completely heal.  Had it only been an hour?  Time does work strangely in the Feywild, and this sobers all to that realization.  Meanwhile, Bellatrix and her sister scour the wilderness for ingredients. Finally, when all were rested and repaired, Erifias says, "Well, now, I believe we are all in better health.  Let us make our way.   We can discuss things as we move.   Is that acceptable?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Yes, I believe that is the best course of action. My ears are open fellows, let us listen deeply and understand much."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Very well." Everyone packs up and begins heading our, Otirnis leading the way silently.  Bellatrix and the old woman follow the female eladrin, while Maouelue and the eladrin leader speak behind them.  Taking up the rear is Daran, ever watchful.  As all eyes scan the forest for signs of movement, life, or danger.  (Imagine the story telling as a beautiful ballad, not the quick-and-dirty I'm going to drop here!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't know how much you know about the Feywild, so I'll start there.  It is our understanding that we are a part of your material plane, and yet not.  We are the closest cross-over, however we are also afloat in the astral sea.  Some say we are a part of Arvandor, which is why Elves find themselves renewed here above all else.  Some say we're a plane of Olympus of Celestia, where the great dragon dwells.  In truth, we are simply...  the Feywild.  And we do what we can to preserve the balance of good and evil while benefitting from this land's beauty.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Otirnis and I are the protectors of seelie fey.  Our court is led by the High Queen Titania, and her Lord Oberon.  They rule in the city in the clouds, Senaliesse.  All of the seelie archfey live there, which is nigh impenetrable from its place in the heavens.  For us and our part, we live in the city of Astrazalian, which is watched after by Queen Titania's sister, the good sister, Queen Tiandra.  The bad sister, The Queen of Air and Darkness," he shudders, "She lives in the Feydark and commands forces of those abominations you fought earlier. Fomorians, they're known as.  Diseased and deformed because of their love of deceit and trickery.  They would have us seelie fey grovel and serve them for eternity, which is why we fight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Queen of Air and Darkness has no love in her heart.  She was to be the one to look over Astrazalian, but a contingent of dwarves brought the woman a black crystal that turned her heart to stone and bent her will to evil.  She will stop at nothing to rid this great land of the seelie fey.  Her co-horts, they're considered the unseelie.  Problem is, you never can tell which you're speaking with until it's too late.  Part of our hesitation with you and your folk here, mage.  Again, I hope that you will forgive us our intensity.   But it is how we have to be with our borders under constant attack.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"And lately, not just our borders.  Astrazalian has been attacked thrice in the last season.  Once in ten years is even more than normal, so this...  I can tell you, both Queens Titania and Tiandra are concerned what this means for the future of the feywild at large.  Goblins are joining with the fomorians.  They're recruiting the Moon Court, as well.  Which means lycanthropes may be at our gates at night, and giants and goblins attack during the day.  No one can fight a battle on three sides.  And there might be an archwizard at play here, too.  From your world.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Needless to say, aside from all of our martial ability and arcane skill, we're at a deficit.  We'd like to get more outliers to band together, but it is political and difficult.  Our foursome are a scouting party for both new members, and for the movement of the opposing forces.   There have been rumors, however, that Queen Titania would like a rogue group to go behind enemy lines and strike at the heart of the insurgence."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It was being surrounded by trouble on all sides that led us to tread these lands just ere. Some dark secret has begun to stir in our realm. Lofty lords who dug too deep in search of ancestral powers have drawn fel beings to our realm. Serpent walks as man through the streets, dark underground shrines and altars of sacrifice lie underneath our very feet. Yes, foul magic indeed and perhaps and Archmage you say? I do not envy the position of my confidant Dieter, who was taken into the clutches of this very mystery. It is mine and our party's mission to divine his location and rescue his person. It could be that the Queen and our consort could come to a collective conclusion that carries our copacetic causes."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They nod, considering.  "Yes, yes.  I believe there are copacetic causes here.  Snakes as men, you say.  Curious.  There have been sightings here of the same.  Snakes are not native to the Feywild.  Very curious."  Erifias scratches his hairless chin.  "I wonder...  this archmage in your realm, could you recognize them on sight?  And these serpents, could you identify them if you saw them again?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The serpents yes, the archmage? I couldn’t say...We were following the traces left my the Lord Muhlen and his progeny deep into the earth. We found a deep ravine that seemed to stretch down into the abyss just outside our township of Oakhurst. There seemed to be competing causes in the caves, either one always a step ahead of us.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Erifias ponders deeply, furrowed brows giving him a strange, elderly look.  They shake their head, "The Queens will need to hear what you know.  And, if they do ask you for help with the attack, you'll have our help behind you."</p>

<p>As Erifias stops speaking, all of the elven ears hear a murmur in the distance.  A low buzzing sound that grows in intensity as the group pauses, listening.  Waiting.  The buzz turns into a horn sound, starting off very low in timbre and growing loud and rounded, sounding like horn mixed with the beat of a bass drum.  The welling surrounds the group, and, looking at the eladrin, Maouelue sees abject fear in their eyes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"RUN!" yells Erifias, and Otirnis grabs Bellatrix and the old woman and they vanish, disappearing out of sight.  "Do either of you have any transport spells?  I am unable to use mine at the moment."  Fear creases their face, their head is on a swivel trying to look at the entire forest while sprinting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Running away from the sound, the now trio fund themselves running straight at a patch of blackness on the ground.  It clashes right away with the surrounding woods.  Suddenly, Erifias stops cold in his tracks, grabs the backs of the garments of Maouelue and Daran as they just go past them.  Erifias looks to the left and the right.  The pair follow the eye movements and spy two moss-ridden obelisks jutting from the ground.  It looks as if the ground past the pillars starts to become sodden, muddy, bog-like.  After 50ft or so, the ground becomes like pitch or tar, bubbling in places.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<p>(might have to use those Metallicomets sooner than expected!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue gets a shiver up his spine.  He scans the bog, seeing the beautiful trees arch away from this place.  The ones that can't move themselves farther away turn diseased.  Their bark peels, the wood desiccated and rotten as it seeps into the mire.  Then Maouelue looks closer.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The eyes continue to blink.  The group continues to back away.  The beating of your hearts fades, but is replaced by the horn and bass drum from seconds earlier.  Panic starts to set in.  Erifias bolts to the right, yelling, "Follow me!  There has to be a way around!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The mechanics - you're being pursued by...   gods know what.  They're still a ways behind you according to the sounds of the horn and drums.  However, you also have a terrain that might be impossible to travel through.  Survival checks will determine how well the area is navigated and if you all are finding your way through.  Straight rolls, I'm going to do a group check too.  Against an increasing DC.  Starting at 10, going up by 2, we'll have to pass three to get to safety.  Missing 3 means...  something else.  And failing a group check by more than 6 will result in a random event.  Here we go!!)</p>

<p>The group sees the black sludge RISE UP out of the muck, into a humanoid-ish shape of eyes and goo.  It tries to smash down on the group...  but just misses!  The horn blares suddenly, off to the right of the group.  It pulls Erifias' head around just enough for them to lose balance.  Daran rescues him just as they're about to fall, and now both Daran and the eladrin are 15 feet behind Maouelue.</p>

<p>The edge of the bog appears ahead of the trio.  Just a few more feet and they'll be beyond the black sludge and be able to continue...   That's when the horn blares triumphant and the drums beat viciously.  Emerging from the forest, knocking trees over in the process, is a horde of goblins.  Some are atop wargs, some even ride an ogre or two.  But the main group ride a contraption that, in one, looks to be a wagon turned into a siege machine.  It towers over 20ft tall, and, strangely, doesn't seem to be pulled by anything.   Thick gouts of black smoke erupt from behind it as it's propelled forward...  right at the group!</p>

<p>(Wanted to run an idea for Frosty Ball that I'm not sure if we've discussed before. Can I consider it a light weapon, so I could throw two charged balls in a turn? Also, I have a thought about a sort of magnetic re-summoning of balls that have been flung. Like perhaps casting Maouelue's Metallicomets would do that automatically, or perhaps I could use a bonus action to re-attract them to me?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to make these a big part of his character fantasy without being too OP about it)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I think that'll work, as long as they're not doing d12 damage each!  I always thought it weird that a character can't make multiple ranged weapons shots without taking a feat or having it be a racial or class thing.  Go for it, though!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(BTW, the goblin wagon looks a little like this, with goblins hanging on it:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Since it's not a Loading weapon, it seems to make sense. Maybe down the road he can get a "feat" that allows him to pull thrown ones back that hit on the way for some damage. That would be dope. See Xayah Bladecaller for an idea of what i'm getting at.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Would it be the double hit, too?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just to note, I don't think I should get that until like level 10 or so, but it would just hit based on how many are out there and if they pass through creatures on the way, so it would depend on the state of the battlefield.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Almost like a rune trap or something, sure!  Once they pass, you pull the string.  Sounds like a plan to me!)</p>

<p>The two watch as the crazy wagon weapon sinks into the mire.  It's about half in now, but Maouelue sees a couple packs on the back of the machine.  The smoke has stopped now, and a couple good dex or acrobatic checks could get you there and back with the packs.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is a bit too heavy.  When he tries to jump, he lands a few feet from it, square in the black sludge.  (Con save and then dex save, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran gets a rope out of his pack and quickly tosses it to the mage.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue grabs the rope and is whisked back to safety.  The wagon drops a few more feet.  Luckily, there were not ill effects from the sludge...  for the moment.  Daran holds up a finger, then gets ready to jump.</p>

<p>The ranger hops deftly over the bog in one go, grabs the two satchels.  But just as he's jumping back over, the goblin weapon lurches and throws of Daran's balance by just enough.  He lands just a couple feet shy of the edge of the bog.  Quickly, he standing-jumps out, but falls to his knees, clasping his head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shakes his head, stands, and hands the bags to Maouelue.  "If there's anything edible in there, I'd appreciate a bite and a rest."  He smiles at Maouelue.</p>

<p>The first bag is muddy and ill-kept.  It has pouches on the sides, but they are empty on inspection.  A thin flap of material covers the opening of the bag.  As Maouelue opens it, he finds some bits of hard tack and jerky.  Both smell a little stale, but edible.  At the bottom of the bag are a very nice set of bone dice.  Lastly, a platinum amulet with a strange symbol weighs the satchel down.</p>

<p>"I think I might be too old for this..." says Daran as another moss-and-mud-streaked obelisk emerges from the forest floor 20ft from their location.  Immediately behind the two heroes, the black ooze starts moving their direction while the trees between them and the sludge start deteriorating fast.</p><p>"I fucking hate this place."</p>

<p>The <i>thing</i>  wobbles, quakes... then speaks.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a voice that can only be described as gelatinous material being pushed through a sieve, the words roil out, attacking the heroes' senses.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You are quick.  We were hoping for a snack.  The goblins and their mounts will have to do.  When you see Titania, give her a message from us.  We are here.  And we are coming.  First her lands. Then her people.  Then," it makes a disgusting <i>slurrrping</i> sound.  "Then we come for her."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stares in horror at the bog beast, shocked into stillness for a moment, then righting himself and calling back, "We'll see about that you disgusting slime. A new light shines on these lands that you cannot hope to drench in your foul darkness. Go back to the brimstone quagmire whence you came!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Big words for one so young.  And small.  Deliver my message or no.  It matters not.  All come to me in the end."  And it melts back into the bog.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seconds later, a flash of blue light appears a distance away, in the direction of the forever setting sun.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue lets out a deep breath with eyes closed as the fiend leaves, then looks up at the horizon, letting the light sear into his eyes and warm his plate. The flash pours in through his eyes to his soul, scouring the remnants of fear and disgust that sought to take root there from this latest encounter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us away, pray that the eladrin find us."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can I do a perception on which way I heard Elfias leave?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>As the duo shield their eyes to look into the sunset, they see forty or so winter eladrin running through the forest clearing towards them, Otirnis in the lead.  Bellatrix can also be seen, just behind the lady eladrin.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Noticing the ranks and...Bellatrix...rushing in, Maouleue dusts himself up and stands tall, propping Daran up into a casually relaxed posture as he does. </p><p></p><p><i>Yes, that will have the desired effect.</i></p>

<p>The light beams and shatters prismatically across the cool blue-white plate, three frosted platinum spheres still tracing around the mage atomically.</p>

<p>(oh dear)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The army approaches you both <i>extremely</i> cautiously.  Even Bellatrix, noting the gruesome nature of the arrow-and-frost ridden goblins, worgs, and ogres, gives the both of you a wider berth.  "Ahoy, there," an eladrin yells.  "Are you Maouelue the Mage and Daran the ranger, come from the material plane?  Answer true, or there will be violence in the name of Queen Titania!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue let’s his orbs come to a rest, arranging them as verticies in an equilateral triangle surrounding his feet. As he does this, the other six coalesce into a surrounding hexagon, giving the effect of a metallic mandala with the Dragon Mage at its center. ￼</p><p></p><p>“I am one and the same. My companion and I have needed life-saving measures, both from each other and in service of your kin, having done the same for them amidst similar suspicion. It would seem your lands are overrun with darkness from beneath. It is that which both pushes and draws my company higher. Pray, I seek now violence with the Queen nor any of her <i>servants</i>. Mine and our aim together would be to shine mine and thine divine light on the roots of this evil. Would you not agree?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They look at each other, searchingly.  Otirnis strides forward and, placatingly, tries to ease this strange tension.  "It is well that we found you here.  After the report from Erifias, we though you would be perished.  They send their apologies for the abrupt exit.  We are only able to use our fey transportation once in a full-day's time.  Since they used it to bring our original foursome scouting party to this woods, Erifias was unable to use it again so quickly.  Only after an intense meditation were they able to use it.  They are aware you saved their life.  Erifias was heart-broken that their plan did not work."  She crosses her left hand over her right shoulder and bows deeply to the duo.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran goes up to her and lifts her shoulders so that they are face to face.  Her breath catches as they look at each other.  With weariness exuding from him, he returns the salute.  The rest of the soldiers do the same.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix scans over the scene, and catches Maouelue's eye.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He catches her eyes and holding them in his gaze, he salutes her in the same fashion, but slowly, intentionally.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She goes to Maouelue, raises him up, and embraces him.  "I thought I lost you."  The wizard hears soft sobbing in his shoulder.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Stunned, not least by her her show of strength to lift him fully clad, Maouelue lets out a great gasp that turns into a laugh before fading to him softly saying, “No, no, no...I’m still here. And I’m glad you’re here with me Bella.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles, looks down at the ground sheepishly, and says, "I.. I raised a circle of hell when they teleported us and wouldn't bring me back right away."  She looks around, "Seems you did fine by yourselves, though, aye?"  A little brogue comes out, which hadn't been there before.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Not completely certain she didn’t raise an <i>actual</i> circle of hell, he replies, “Your wonders never cease milady...” A pregnant pause and then he adds quietly, “I look forward to our private conversation.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"As do I."  </p><p>Otirnis comes over with a medicine kit, checking over Daran and Mao.  Several others are scouring the forest for remnants and spoils of the battle.   Finally, when all is done, Otirinis says, "It is time to go.  Are you all ready?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue starts at the sound of Otirnis’ voice and moves back into a less familiar position with Bellatrix. “Yes, ah...indeed. Indeed we are Ortinis.” He flashes one more glance back at Bella, not quite able to comply contain his broadening smile.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sets off with the others, not entirely sure if it’s his new boots or something else making him feel like he could jump three times his usual height. </p><p></p><p><i>I’ll have to test that out soon...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The soldiers and the material plane group stand in a circle, on Oritnis's orders.  Everyone touches the other's shoulder, and Otirnis says to Maouelue and Daran, "We'll be transporting to the edge of the city.  From there we'll take you to see Queen Titania.  There's been a ban on teleporting within the city.  Got to be that every a'one that could teleport did for the most mundane reasons.  Became a bit of a problem.  Stay close and hold on to your neighbor.  Here we go."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A blue light surrounds the soldier next to Otirnis.  The glow spreads out from person to person to person, until the little clearing was awash in blue flame.  The forest blurs, the light becomes unbearably bright.  Then, in a <i>pop</i>, the entire group flashes, and everyone disappears.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Quicker than a blink of an eye, the group now stands next to a cobblestoned road that looks gilt in platinum.  It shines, but not harmfully so.  Hands leave shoulders, pats and back-slaps go around the group.   A few nod respectfully towards the two newcomers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue bends down on two knees in reverence, then takes his palms together, leaning forward onto the platinum stone road. Leaning forward, he touches his helmet to the surface and prays. “Lord of life I am humbled in your deliverance.  My light follows only thine own.”</p><p>He stays kneeling for three long breaths, three seconds, six seconds, nine seconds...Then raises himself back up to the group, collected in spirit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All start walking the platinum road, which actually seems to change colors as they walk.  A rainbow patina effect greets Maouelue and Daran as they travel.  Daran smiles, in spite of himself.  After a half mile,  the trees on either side of the road come to an end and the view of the City of Starlight, Astrazalian, emerges.  The tall wall sparkles as a sky at night.  Beyond the gates, the Starlight Castle careens toward the sky.  Spires and turrets abound.  Color and majesty astound the new arrivals.  Some of the soldiers laugh at the mouths agape.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Astrazalian, The City of Starlight</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue feels the celestial beauty of the city like a blast in the chest, riveting and warm, like home...something he had not felt since back in the tower with Shi’Vandos. Something in the sky</p><p>catches his eye....is it a cloud? Was he seeing things or was his lord presenting himself in the silvery mists above the Starlight Castle? He shakes himself out of it, keen on staying aware of the cohort in which his companions now find themselves. It <i>feels</i> like home, but he knows it’s not. Not <i>yet</i> anyway...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Otirnis comes up beside Maouelue's group.  "We'll be heading straight for the keep.  Queen Titania and King Oberon are waiting there with The Seneschal, Queen Tiandra.  There, we will debrief them on all that has happened.  You can bring them up to speed on what we missed and your business in the Feywild.  Then, we can show you to accommodations.  We'll also be available if you need anything, or need to know where to find something in the city.  Follow me.  Oh, and welcome to Astrazalian!"  She smiles and nods.  Then jogs up a few paces to join in with two other winter eladrin.  Together, they lead you down the road to the crystalline city gates.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wonders about as the group enters the city and make their way to the castle.  Every color of Elf stand in the street to see the procession pass.  There are cheers and applause.  Children run into the street to touch the soldiers armor.  Some come up to Maouelue , Daran, and Bellatrix.  Reverence beams on their faces and in their eyes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The city center is awash with Elves awaiting the processional, too.  When they arrive, it's akin to the biggest celebration day any of the material planes people have ever seen.  Hands are wrung, backs are thumped.  Smiles are shared all around.  Finally, the last climb to the castle is begun, and the shouts of the crowds die away.  The doors of the keep are opened, the group pours in.  Once in, the soldiers split into their different avenues, Otirnis and her group motion the others to follow her.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Up the crystal staircase, through the beatific front halls, the trio is led into a massive throne room.  Atop the central dais, an inescapably beautiful summer elf, golden skin and hair wafting in unseen wind, sits upon the main throne.  Her king to her right, also golden from head to toe, sits smiling.  Lastly, a woman on the Queen's left and closer to the front of the dais seems to be made completely of silver.  All three sit up in interest at the soldiers and outsiders stride to them.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Queen Titania and King Oberon, I present Maouelue the Mage, Daran the Ranger, and Bellatrix the Wizardess, three being from the material plane, come to honor your highnesses."  She bows as before in the forest.  Daran and Bellatrix follow suit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue joins in the protocol gratefully, but skips a beat as he realizes for the first time that he doesn’t see the Sister. <i>Where has she gone?</i> He wonders. His attentions returning, he follows Otirnis’ lead.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen atop the dais nods to King Oberon, and he starts in giving a grand welcome.  In Maouelue's mind, however, he hears a light, flowery female voice.  "Do not be afraid, dear cousin.  Bella's sister is safe and well in her rooms here in Castle Starlight."  A smiling Queen Titania looks at Maouelue from her throne.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for bedtime.  Be back soon!)</p>

<p>(Thought there was some precedent for it 😉)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh indeed there was haha)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches out with his feelings, trying to test the limits of this connection, maintaining eye contact with Titania throughout. </p><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>”Thank you for the hospitality and for assuaging my fears. I have read tome after long tome about the majesties of the star children. To be here in this moment is my greatest honor. May I be worthy of these hallowed halls in the end.”</span></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods, smiling.  King Oberon continues, and ends with a flourish.  There is polite clapping, he sits down, pride exuding from him.  The Queen gives him a wry smile.  She stands to address the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue casts a sideways glance at Bellatrix to see, among other things, whether she had a similar experience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You all are most welcome here in the shining halls of our Castle Starlight.  We greatly appreciate your aid to our lands, and we sincerely hope there is more aid to offer, from both sides.  I look forward to hearing more of who our heroes are and what we can do to aid you in your fight.  Let us remove to our planning room.  I would hear more from each of you, if you please."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She was walking down the dais, and, in making the last statement, hits the main floor.  She waves the group over to a side room, and leads them to a beautifully decorated, catered room.  Food lines the wall and are piled on the table.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue gives Bella a look, she looks back questioningly at him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Seeing her lack of understanding at his look, he quickly pivots to gesture to the grandeur of the Castle in all its glory, and that food...it is now that Maouelue realized he hasn’t <i>properly</i> eaten in weeks, if he could trust time anymore...the delicate spread takes over his conscience as they are led to the  reception.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry dude, got sidetracked tonight.  Did you want a list of the food, by chance?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(all good. we’re doing a date night in here anyway. Iffn ya want to go ahead and list the food. I’m interested in the elven diet 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sure thing!  Have a great night, brother!  I'll get that cuisine to you tomorrow!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool cool!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The full opaque crystal doors are drawn wide, showing an expansive room.  Not quite as large as the throne room, it's centerpiece is a massive transparent table, ovoid with many embellished chairs in the elven design.  On the table are varied stands of dried and fresh fruits, nuts, and light breads.  Large platinum ewers decorate the table with what looks to be wine.  Tables are set up along the sides of the main meeting space.  These are piles high with dishes both exotic and breathtaking.  Platinum bowls and serving plates hold tremendous amounts of delicacies.  There is a roasted bird about the size of two turkeys at the center, flanked by pink fish with a fiery sauce, greens and exotic-colored vegetables, stuffed pastries, and odd round objects covered in white shavings.  Flowers abound, mixing with the spicy and sweet aromas of the food.  The Queen says, "Eat, drink, be merry.  We will talk while we enjoy our heroes feast!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Servants stand at attention for anyone who needs assistance.  Several cellerars are standing in wait with drinks, if the table wine is not wanted.  The Queens and King stride through, picking at the table foods and finding their seats at the table's head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Moments later, the old woman is brought down and she and Bellatrix have a happy reunion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue assembles a plate with perhaps a bit less decorum than he might have wished, were he not <i>quite</i> so hungry. He is still agog with the wonder of this realm, regardless of the troubles it had already caused his party. He sits down on the left side of the King and Queen, offering Bellatrix a seat next to him at the table and calling for wine.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wine is poured by a lithe and sensual female summer eladrin that gives Maouelue a secret wink.  The smells of the food almost overwhelm him.  The wine is ruby hued, with flecks of gold fluttering within.  The food not only lifts the mages spirit, it gives him an undeniable feeling of hope and resurgence.  Akin to the feeling he had when first he came to the Feywild.  Daran and the others are similarly taken with the meal and the ambience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>After a few moments of pure revelry in the tastes and smells, Queen Titania breaks the silence by saying, "I apologize for mixing business and pleasure.  I encourage you all to help yourselves to anything here, our table is yours.  However, we must speak on the events of the past day and look to the future.  Erifias and Otrinis have filled me in on the general events, to the best of their abilities.  Erifias is sleeping well, now.  Our best clerics administered them a great amount of healing.  They were nearly inconsolable, they thought their plan had doomed the two of you.  When Erifias awakes, it would do them well for you to be there, if you wish.  That being said, we must speak on our individual needs.  If it please you, I shall go first and let you continue to enjoy your repast?"  She blinks her large lavender eyes in Maouelue's direction, waiting for his permission.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks up with a leg of foul in his mouth, trying to nonchalantly out it back down on his plate and swallow quickly before he answers, “Of course, your Majesty.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm reminded of Bobby commenting on Fishman doing the same thing in Bittersweet Motel!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The King chuckles and pops a quith-pa (the orb-like food) into his mouth.  The Queen smiles and continues, "We have been at war with the unseelie for quite some time.  My sister, who now calls herself the Queen of Air and Darkness, has been corrupted by a dark crystal.  In truth, if we could destroy the crystal, that would right everything, but I fear that is too lofty a goal for now.  She has raised an army, which has been attacking and killing our peoples all around the lands of the Feywild.  With her dire generals, she has made several strongholds, however most of them are in the Feydark.  I would not ask you to go into that abyss, for that would be requesting much more than any of us has to give.  However, there is one thing I believe you might be well suited for.  You have all proven yourselves tremendous fighters.  I believe if we were to eliminate a top ranking official of her command, we could stem the tide of the war, or shift it to our side.  I've been in talks with other realms regarding the creation of a force that might quell this uprising long-term.  Now, however, we need to strike deeply into her structure and make her realize we are not easy prey.  For this, along with our undying friendship, we offer you a boon.  Either of your request or of our choosing."  Her lavender eyes and golden skin ripple from the crystal reflection off of the table and plate-ware.  Her hair still wafts in the unseen breeze.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue, now recovering his somber and moderately zealous vigor, takes in the state of affairs and the interesting proposition before him and his followers. He looks around to Daran, Bella and her sister. He thinks of Vam and Heston, the wreckage of Oakhurst. He remembers poor Douglas, fallen to the vile Muhlen brood, and Culver whatever became of him. Most of all, he thinks of Dieter... Where in the depths of that foul Citadel could he be? What would he do in this situation? Surely the resourceful Druid was putting his cunning to great use, but how much time did he really have?</p><p></p><p>"My Queen, if I may call you thus, I feel a deep kinship to you and your people, <i>our people</i> and I would see this land restored to peace and glory. I will aid in its deliverance will all that I have to spare. My companions here, I leave to make their own choices, for they have risked much on my behalf already.</p><p></p><p>As are undoubtedly aware, we also face a grave uprising in our realm of Faerun. Dread Neogi walk in the daylight in forms both human and serpentine. Power mongers and arcane excavators have delved too deep into the secrets of our own underworld. As my companion Dieter the Deleter and I followed these dark trails, we followed a series of ancient tombs, each decorated with disturbing imagery of these serpents in their rituals of sacrifice and uprising.</p><p></p><p>It is true that I understand but little of the scope of this war, if that should be how we name it. I fear it is a war that has raged longer than even your sister's corruption. Yes, I will aid you in this cause, for it is far from impossible that these dark threads are bound in some way together, yet, my companion Dieter and I are also honorbound to each other and I will not leave him to fate at the hands of those who would seek to befoul our lands.</p><p></p><p>You speak of a boon and I would receive it gratefully, though I would also seek council and aid in our own fight. As I say, they may indeed be one and the same after all is laid bare."</p>

<p>Maouelue sees the Queen cock her head to the side, thinking, reflecting on the possibility the core of the problem is somehow linked between planes.  "You speak well, mage.  And you reason even better.  My sight does not cross to the material plane as well as it does others, but you have touched on a subject - reached it's core in truth -  that many of our archfey and protectors of other planes have worried over for some time.  There is a darkness that stirs.  It is gathering momentum, gathering strength in the form of powerful beings with long reaches.  I am afraid my sister is one.  You world may have one or many, as well.  This is truly a sobering thought."  She takes a deep breath.  "However, we cannot sit idly by and watch as our worlds are thrown into chaos.  It pleases the court that you would agree to this course of action.  Are you all in agreement, then?  Or do you wish for privacy, or more time to deliberate?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I consent on my own behalf. I invite the others to make their own assertions. I understand the need for haste, but I would ask of your hospitality a moment of repose for my party to tend our injuries and to convene amongst ourselves. I fear we are all still in a state of shock whose depths may yet be untapped. Would you grant us a reprieve of four hours to collect ourselves? After that, I would desire to meet in your war council chambers, if such a think ere had need of existence in these halls, and plan our strategies accordingly."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group looks appreciatively at Maouelue.  The Queen says, "We shall meet in our battle council chambers, but you may take as much time as you need.  Please venture anywhere in our castle or city.  If there is anything you need, we will send you with a attendant."  She looks to her head servant.  There is a short whispered conversation, and she returns to Maouelue to say, "Everything is arranged.  When you are ready to discuss the details, please let your valet know and we will meet here again."  She stands, as do the others right after her.  "It pleases me greatly that you are here, Maouelue the Mage.  It is indeed serendipitous.  You are most welcome here.  Well met."  She bows to you, in their fashion, as do all eladrin in the room.</p>

<p>(oops i was typing fast on a different device. let me revise that for clarity.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue stands and bows in return, thanking the Lord and Lady profusely for their hospitality before turning to the valet and asking where they might find their chambers to let down.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Court retires to a room beyond the feast hall, the valet ushers you all into separate rooms not far from the throne room, all on the main level.  The rooms are spacious, airy, and decorated simply but elegantly.  A warm breeze plays at the curtains, where beyond is a balcony overlooking the city center.  A soldier comes in, introduces himself, and resumes a station outside your door.  There is  full washroom, a sitting room, and a sleeping chamber.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As Maouelue walks into the room he cannot help but think to himself, “<i>I could get used to this...I musn’t...but I could.</i>” He begins to doff his armor, rubbing his shoulders as he does. There are some aches that even the elven food won’t cure, and it certainly does not quell the smell of his under armor sweat. He strips down bare leaving the armor and garments in a corner of the room before moving into the washroom and drawing a hot bath for a long-overdue soak. </p><p></p><p>Though he is by rights a frost mage, Maouleue does not shy away from bringing the water to a heat just shy of scalding. A pure heat from within, as Shi’Vandos used to say, stays an frozen heart when the ice starts to flow. </p><p></p><p>As he sets himself in and lets the hot water scour his skin and spirit, the rare combination of warmth, silence, and safety cast him into a misty reverie.</p><p></p><p>The rising steam in his eyes turns to swirling clouds, spinning upwards to a vision of the tower where his master...his father...<i>it still hadn’t quite set in after all this time...</i> had led him to the discovery of his secret heritage. The memories, always a distorted mixture of emotions in his mind, seem to resolve more clearly in this palace of starlight....</p><p></p><p><i>“My son....”</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shi'Vandos smiles kindly down at the boy, but the smile doesn't completely reach his eyes.  He looks sorrowful and frustrated.  "It is...  not a story I like to tell.  I would rather you remember me, know me for my triumphs.  Not my failures.  Mortals have the potential for great works and deeds.  Yet, when posed with the possibility of... gratification..."  He shrugs.   "We are mortal.  My choices have erred on the side of pleasure, as time is so short.  Even for us elves."  He calmly moves to sit at a nearby chair.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue does not speak fir fear of faltering. He listens patiently, trying in vain to still the icy tempest forming in his heart and soul.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The elder elf sees the torment on his pupil's face, and the look of sorrow deepens.  Not only for what has been done, but what needs to be done as well. </p><p></p><p>"I shall try to explain.  Some time ago, I was fortunate enough to live in and study the magics of the Feywild, a section of Arborea or Celestia, another plane altogether.  It is where a selection of elves, some would say the <i>prime</i> selection of elves, segregated themselves.  It is a land rife with danger, beset on all sides by evil that would tear the elves asunder if they let their guards down for an instant.  Not exactly Arvandor, but, then again, what can be.  I was born there, grew there, learned the secrets of magic there...  and was exiled from that wondrous land because of my...  nature.  A woman was my downfall."  He hangs his head, but there is a smile on his face, in remembrance.  "Noble families can be particular about who they allow into their... erm...  bloodline.  My family... <i>our</i> family is not noble born.  We are not eladrin.  But we are still elf, and that should garner some respect, from all corners of Toril."  He shakes his head.  "Anyway, I was exiled and sent through a crossroad to the material plane.  Alone.  To make my way in the great world.  And I did so.  Sometimes alone.  Sometimes, no so much so.  There was a woman.  A druid.  In the wilds of the Neverwinter Wood.  I was near death.  She took me in.  I owe her my life."  He stares into the distance, lost to his thoughts for a moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"When she told me she was with child...  I don't know.  I wasn't ready for that.  I was not ready for a life like that.  Nor was I able to give her or the child what they needed, and I knew that.  Yet there was no convincing her of that fact."  Shi'Vandros's long, sorrowful face looks into Lemaoue's soft, tear-filled eyes.  "Your mother and I parted ways that day, not destined to see each other ever again."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He tears his eyes away from you, a tear streaking down his cheek.  "It was several years later that I had the opportunity to try again.  This time with a woman from a small coastal town on the Sword Coast.  A cleric of Lathander, she was, and we had to keep our love a secret.  It was a thrill for me, and when she became... in the family way, I strove to do better.  I told her we could have the child in secret, take a long trip and, when she returned, she could take up the vocation again without anyone being wiser.  So, that's what we did.  She had a friend in the town, we arranged it so that the child would grow up as hers, in her family.  And we would all be able to be happy, at least somewhat.  Both families were so wonderful with the child.  It soon became..."  His voice breaks, a sob pulled from him like a reverse bellows.  Like a dragon breathing fire, the pain of the past came belching from the elder's chest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It became clear I was unneeded and unwanted.  I left on the morrow.  Again, never to look back.  Some years later, after I took a position as a teacher here, I looked in on you.  As I've said before, I always knew you had an aptitude for the arcane.  Know you know why I was so adamant."  He smiles at Lamaoue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A few years after your lessons began in earnest, I received this letter."  He reaches into a fold of his robes and hands a very crumpled piece of parchment over to the apprentice.  Shi'Vandos then bends at the waist and covers his face with his hands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The letter reads: 
*Dear Father, Shi'Vandos of the Feywild ~ You knew me as a child.  My mother was Siercha Brightshine of Leilon, she told me of you.  I am truly sorry we never had the chance to be more acquainted.  My stand-in father, Merrygold, has nothing but positive things to say about you.  Mother is quite mum on the whole topic.  Truthfully, she told me to never try to find you.  It was her dying wish, actually.  So, I am writing you to tell you that I am not coming to try and find you.  I am, however, going to trace our lineage.  I've already done some studies, and have been to visit the Feywild two times already.  Did you know we have a family vault?  Regretfully, since I am a bastard and you an exile for life, neither of us are allowed what's rightfully ours.  I'm writing you now to tell you this - I will get what is owed to me.  There is a right of passage in the Feywild.  If an elf can prove they are part of a living line and pass the trials, they are able to be looked upon as a full member of the family.  With all of the perks associated therein.  You will meet me in the Feywild, and you will help me in this.  You know where I will be.  I will be waiting, father.  Shi'veilan Brightshine*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Awesome.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks up now at Shi’vandos with red, running eyes and reaches out a shaking hand to take the letter, reading it over and over. </p><p></p><p>“...And so it comes to this...you would shed your kindred responsibility once more and leave the cleanup to those in your wake? You would have me go in your stead to find this....Shi’vailen, my....my <i>half-brother</i>....Do I indeed divine your intent...<i>father</i>...</p><p></p><p>He now holds the letter with two quaking hands, sadness mixed with rage and thoughts of betrayal, of love....of loss. </p><p></p><p>“Why...why father? I still...I still...” Lumao fully breaks down now, dropping the letter to the ground and sinking his head fully into his quivering palms.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shi'Vandos slowly unfurls himself and rises until he is looking his newly named son face-to-face.  He is no longer sad.  He is furious.  </p><p>"I would have you learn that which you seek, youngling.  I would have you take what is yours by birthright.  Not your upstart brother, who knows NOTHING of me.  Of my struggles.  Of his lineage.  He seeks the trials, but at the end, there will be nothing but tribulation on him.  He will continue to be shunned and will be exiled from the Feywild, as I was.  Because he is not eligible for the blessing.  You want to know of the 'circled key'?  You want to know of the deep ice in the mountain?  You want to master the element, master <i>youself</i>?  Then claim your birthright.  Not for me, not for <i>my</i> redemption.  That is impossible now."  His eyes burn a blue flame.  "If <i>you</i> request the trials and live to finish, when you are presented with the crest, <i>only you</i> will be able to take on the symbol.  Only you.  It is up to you.  Take what is yours.  Or carve your own path."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Had he been thinking clearly, Lumao might have expected something like this. It was not often that he let his tempers get the better of him, and now that his impertinence has drawn forth this furious retort, his shame and guilt grow red on his face. A new flood of tears begin to flow now, tears of embarrassment and remorse for his lack of faith in Shi'Vandos. Never before had his master...father...given him reason to provoke, to lash out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Father...I beg your forgiveness. I should not lose my temper nor doubt you. You have been ever attentive to me and I must admit, I've always felt your teachings and presence as fatherly, and now in the moment of truth that that is indeed the case...I have failed you at the first step. It is not my place to doubt you. It is not my wish to scorn. I must ask your forgiveness, for I should not presume to know your thoughts, I should not presume to lecture on that which I do not know. My penance now, must be to follow through on this revelation of knowledge. </p><p></p><p>You are dear to me above all and I am ashamed to have chided you. I will carry out this quest of heritage that you have entrusted to me. I will find answers...May I earn my absolution through this journey.</p><p></p><p>I will not fail you."</p><p></p><p>Lumao lowers himself in a submissive deference to the majestic and larger-than-life Shi'Vandos, his eyes remaining downcast as he waits for the response.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Raise your eyes, youngling," the elder elf says softly.  "There is no reason to beg forgiveness; no need for your penance or absolution.  Nor is there reason to mistrust your feelings on this matter.  I <i>am</i> to blame for all of this;  for you being put in this position, for Shi'veilan feeling as he does.  However, knowing what we know of the arcane, of the weave that blends and balances, the weft and warp correcting flaws and strengthening bonds...  We know all things have their place.  Even feelings.  Go forward with your passion.  Go forward with your fire.  You could never displease me...  son.  You are strong."  He stands in front of his student, hands inside the opposite sleeves, eyes wet with emotion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your wayward brother will be at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  He will be expecting me.  Give him this note.  Then, no doubt, you will begin the trials.  They are a series of tests, but not like what your brother is expecting, I imagine.  They are tests of character, not of skill or strength.  Not even of magic, although the result will get you that which you have been studying and searching for.  Take what you need for a long journey.  You can find a crossover to Faerie in several areas, but the strongest and possibly the most direct might be near Mount Hotenow, or one of it's cave systems.  I seem to remember one leading me right into the heart of the Neverwinter Wood."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks wistful, staring out one of the stain-glassed windows.  "Who knows," he says into the distance, "you might even find someone to share the road with you."  He blinks, seems to come back to himself, and smiles at Lumaoue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The apprentice, now collecting himself, lifts his head now and as he sees the smiling face of his father, he swells and straightens upright, now once again holding himself with the dignity that is his due. He hoped he would never forget this moment. Though his quest was daunting, finally, he would lay down the lore and become the stuff of stories. How he had always dreamed of Faerie and all its mysteries. Ancient starlight...</p><p></p><p>“I will leave at dawn.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Shi'Vandros, eyes shining, closes them and bows in the ways of his forefathers to young Lumaoue.  He straightens and, with a smile, leaves his apprentice to get ready.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The scene becomes misty as he hears a sweet music drifting into his consciousness. A montage of  his fledgling journey begins to fly through his minds eye; the descent from the tower and through the main academy grounds, carrying only what he absolutely needed, a spartan beginning for an aspiring hero. Soon the carefully engineered wooden walkways of the campus grounds give way to the deeper, wilder woods beyond. As the trees approach they begin to domineer over him, and a cold wind blows through, it seems to root him, he tries to put a foot forward into the trees but his body won’t obey. Something has him rooted. As he struggles against the sensation, slowly fear and breathlessness overtake his view into darkness...</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage comes up spluttering, coughing out spurts of the lush foamy water. His reverie had taken him deep, perhaps a bit too deep. Wiping the foam and water from his face he rises out of the tub, a sight to behold, wavering but collecting in the steamy washroom air. He dries himself and puts on a robe before sidling over to the day bed and beginning a prayer to his patron asking for guidance. In answer, he simply hears, “Stay Vigilant.” The Dragon Mage picks up his armaments and gets to his exercises, exorcising the foul blockages of his psyche with each thrust and shadow parry. Back to work.</p>

<p>There's a knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Enter.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let me accompany you to the market. I need to have a look around myself. What of the lady Bellatrix and her sister?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Haven't checked in yet."  They were shown to their room next to yours.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Good. We should head out the two of us at once. Let us not disturb the others.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran nods, turns and makes a motion to the guard at the door.  The ranger has a guard in tow as well, so the four set off into the city proper.</p><p></p><p>The open market is the first thing the group comes to after exiting the palace.  Fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meats, spices all on display.  Various artisans pose their wares, a few of them creating new pieces on the spot.  Music fills the air from several minstrels both passing and stationed in their own artisanal areas.  Beyond are the shop fronts, advertising everything from weaponry and armor to magic elixirs and salves.  A few are fairly unique shops, specializing in curiosities.  The entire city is bathed in an autumnal light from the still setting sun.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Along the way, Maouleue doesn’t speak much. He seems business-like and intent on carrying out a few long overdue bits of trade and to seek out some of the new wares he might find in such a place. He stops first by the weapon and armory to peruse the wares and offer up for sale some of the goods overflowing from his Bag of Holding ™️.</p>

<p>(I apparently have two level 1 spell scrolls that have been idling here. I want to try and roll those. They don’t have spell names on them, so lmk how you think we should handle it.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p><p></p><p>If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 11. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p><p></p><p>This scroll contains a 1st level spell. The spell's saving throw DC is 13 and attack bonus is +5.</p><p></p><p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 11. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.)</p>

<p>Daran nods again, then points to a large shop.  A picture of an anvil with a sword and a bow crossed behind it dominates the entryway.  Wares are put out for display, and it looks like this place is a one-stop-shop for armory and weapons.  A blacksmith's, fletcher's, and weaponsmith's shops are all all rolled into one, and there are several armor stands decked out in front of the place with impressive specimens of the workmanship.  On the decorated anvil sign, Maouelue can read <i>The Unbreakable Anvil</i>.  Loud clanging can be heard from within and near the rear, while a few customers mingle throughout.  There is an elf at the center of the store weaving a leather handle-grip  onto a short sword.</p>

<p>In the back of the store, a semi-open-air forge is set up.  It's a beautiful design only the elves could come up with.  The smoke seems to be siphoned off by some trellis engineering in the domed ceiling of the forge.  The elf that works the anvil is large by elven standards, brawny, but not egregiously so.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks up when Maouelue comes in but doesn't say anything.  Just nods, and goes back to his hammering.  The hammer is a golden piece, beautifully wrought and etched with elven words and decoration throughout.  It rings with a pure, high note every time it hits the silvery sheen-ed metal being worked.  On  the anvil is an interesting attachment for, what Maouelue can surmise, is a halberd or spear of some kind.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He approaches and admires the work. "Good morn good smithy. Tell me do you take commissions here for your work?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a heavy brogue-ish drawl you're not quite sure the origin of, he says, "Aye, I do.  Whatareye lookin' ta fashin?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We'll to be frank, I've been looking to cover up this spot tween my boots and plate. I have a particular proclivity for platinum, a penchant if you will. I am also keen to know whether you work with any enchanters in this city. I have heard of the wonders of Faerie and have some coin."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"OOh, aye.  We can do all o'that for ye, no worries friend.  Ye need some platinum greaves....  I'm almost done with this 'ere."   He starts rummaging around in his bins and crates of materials.  Finding three full platinum bars, he brings them over and says, "This whatcha lookin' for?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well," he lowers his voice a bit, "Between you and me I need summat that will help me keep my head when my lust gets up in battle. I'm afraid this gap in my coverings begins to crave more than that of the wind....But I. Must. Remain. Vigilant. Yes, something to keep both my strength and my head in order." Maouelue looks around for a moment. "Might could you fashion a dragonscale pattern with this here platinum? Know you of any who might bestow them with this balance of power and intelligent restraint?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He scratches his bare chin and ponders.  Snaps and burbles come from the forge as smoke rises and plays at the ceiling tiling.  "Okay, here's wha ye do.  Yer gonna make yer way to the south part of the island, ya?  Once you get outta the city proper, you'll see Lanrion's Tower.  Somma th'shops here'll sell ya potions or whatnot.  Lanrion's the one to go to if'n ye wanna go big, aye?  Did ye want the armor 'fore ye go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes, perfect. Thank you for the guidance. What need you for the work? I’ve got a bit of coins and trade as you see.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye, so ye 'ave!  Great to see!  These big boy's are 50 gold each, base price.  The work'll be another 100 gold.  I can get these done in two days for 250 gold.  If'n tha works for you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Fairest deal this side of the veil.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He reaches out his hand to shake on it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They shake, the blacksmith says, "Name's Tovakis, by the way.  Lemme know if 'ere's anything else we can do for ye."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Maouleue. Pleasure to meet you. Only other thing is to point me to the wizardry around here. I am curious about the local lores and magic of this place and would be keen to see any arcane tomes and scrolls that might be on offer.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Scrolls and tomes yer gonna want either the palace library or Mezomes Tomes, just a few doors down 'ere," and he points you down the street.  "Sfar as wizards are concerned, best places fer that'd be Spellbound, The Elder Marker, or The Lonely Elf.  All of them are in the East part of the city.  The first two are on the main road, the last is right near the city gates.  Can't miss 'em."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Many thanks friend. I’ll be back around in two days to take a look at things. Fare ye well.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue accepts the previous offer on his goods and then proceeds to Mezomes Tomes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran is sitting outside the tri-shop, looking over his new group of arrows.  He looks up, ready to get going.  Maouelue moves down the road to a smaller shop, tucked away in a cul-de-sac of walkways.  It is demure, simple, un-decorated.  Shelves of parchment and leather-bound books abound.  A booking elf with a pair of spectacles perched on the end of her long, slender nose looks up as the pair come in.  In a soft, feathery voice, she says, "Hello?!  How can I help you today?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh hello madam! I am a scholar of the arcane arts. I’m looking for a few spell scrolls to bolster my collection! And I wouldn’t say no to a tome of local lore!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks surprised, then it turns to elation as she scurried out from behind the back of her counter to meet with you.  You can see now that her hair, normally well kept for most eladrin, is a bit scraggly. The spectacles make her amber eyes look three times as big as they should.  She's wearing very plain clothing, but strangely has a traveler's leather vest with many pockets on the front.  She fairly skips over to the duo, making little squeaking noises.  The five cats in the shop look up in curiosity.   A black cat comes over and weaves through Maouelue's legs.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The lore of the Fey lands?  Really?!  Oh, I'm so excited, that's what I am <i>most</i> passionate about here.  Is there an area of expertise you're focused on, or the city itself?"  She looks very expectantly at both men.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“As a matter of fact, I have a few interests. I would know more about the veil that connects the realms, how it weaves the planes together. I would learn of the Fortess of Frozen Tears, for I have heard a small bit that has peaked my interest. Last, I would learn of the trials and rights of lineage of the peoples here. I am a sort of anthropologist that comes from Faerun. I am curious to compare the Sylvan traditions with those of the Feywild...</p><p></p><p>...oh, and yes, whatever spell scrolls you might have about. I would peruse them if they be available.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh.. Oh, my, yes!"  Her hands patter while she looks around the shop.  She tries to steady herself and centers back on Maouelue.  "I can get you the appropriate texts you would need about the Fortress of Frozen tears and the Trials of the Eldar.  OH!  And I have <i>many</i> texts and scrolls on the planes and travel between them.  You come from Faerun, you say!  Oh my, that's <i>lovely</i>!  Tell you what, I'll get some items together, and you and your friend can peruse the spell scrolls at the rear of the store.  They're arranged alphabetically and by level.  I'll meet you back there soon?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Fantastic! The name’s Maouelue, though I used to go by Lumao. You may use either. What is your name mistress?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks shyly at the mage, curtsies, and says, "Nuala Beilyn, m'lord.  Please, take your time to look through my family's store.  I'll gather your texts!"</p>

<p>The woman comes back with a pile of books.  She places them down next to Maouelue and asks, "Did you find the scrolls you were looking for?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“A far few indeed! And see what it is you’ve got there! Oh I do love a good lore dump.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Don't meant to be too brash, but what might we be looking at for this lot?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, my!  Let's take a look."  She peruses the lot.  "All of those, that will be 550 gold pieces.  You might not want all the ones I've found, but all together," Maouelue looks and there's seven books the woman found, "with the scrolls and the books, 800 gold pieces."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue holds out 800 of the gold coin from the armory and accepts the goods. “Thank you for ever so much. Your work will be put to very good ends. I’m sure I’ll be in again sometime. Adieu madam.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Nuala takes the money, and says, "Thank you, m'lord.   Here is a satchel, for you to take everything!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sweeeet! I’m gonna pause there for tonight. Fun shopping spree!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sounds good, brother!  I'll get that lore set for you soon!  Have a good one!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
In the vast pile of books,  there is one about the Vale of Long Night.  Folded in the back is a very nice, although not totally complete, map of the Feywild:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Feywild</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The story sort of reads like a fairy tale (which makes complete sense!) about the son of Queen Titania.  He held court and was attended by three Daughters of Delight.  He was in love with one of them, Sharaea, in fact they were betrothed.  Something changed, however, and she absconded to the mortal plane where she fell in love with an adventurer and devoted her life to fighting evil.  The Sun Prince grew jealous and hunted the pair down relentlessly.  Eventually, he caught up to the two and imprisoned them both.  With her mortal love destined for death, Sharaea made a pact with the Raven Queen to save them both.  The archfey cast the two souls ahead in time, hoping to slake the temper of the Sun Prince.  This act, however, broke the Prince, and he left the city of Astrazalian, never to return.  He made his new home in the Vale of Long Night, and built a tower there, naming it the Fortress of Frozen Tears.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A lot of legends swirl around the Pale Prince and his lands.  There is one that mentions his defeat bringing back summer to the Vale, however it incurs the wrath of Queen Titania, so the truth is murky.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are three smaller books that explain the Rites of Trial for commoners to become lords, lords to become nobles, and nobles to sit on the Court.  There are rituals and rites for having mortals (primarily elves, but the text is hazy) become permanent citizens of the Feywild.  In an obscure text, it tells of the Trials of the Eldar.  The Eldar were a group of the eldest nobles in five families.  Upon one occasion, it was necessary to choose an heir between several of a noble line.  The Five created the trials to help in this process, and it has been a hidden rite of passage for nobles wanting to contest their stations, or to claim a birthright.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only thing about the actual trials themselves is that they are a secretive selection of scenarios that test a person beyond their imagining.  And that the end boon is typically one of the family's choosing, not necessarily a Feywild-specific or Court related prize.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lastly, there are three thick books on the subject of travel through the planes.  A particularly deep on is all about the creation of portals and crossovers.  Another is a philosophical discussion on the formation and design of the planes.  To better know the structure, it posits, one would better know the transportation options available.  Lastly, the third book is an old tome, cracked leather exposing fragile pages seemingly made of woven fibers.  The text in this is foreign to Maouelue and Daran, consisting of mainly pictures.  Notes in another strange language line the pages throughout, and even are interspersed within the pictures.  It is a cacophony of information, none of which makes much sense to the two adventurers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Pinned a message.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us find carriage to the South. I would see of this Lanrion's Tower in order to best make our plans henceforth. I could use the time to review a few of these materials as we pass."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>On of the guards pipes up and says, "We would be happy to procure that for you.  The Queen said if you require transport, we were to set it up under her personal envoy.  If you would excuse me, I will make preparations for a transport to pick you up here.  Unless you would like to meet them elsewhere?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a look around the streets, ah, we could perhaps do our waiting somewhere with a bit of vittles if that would suit. I'm quite keen to try the local fare. I've heard rumour of some new bread and cheese dish with tomatoes or something to that effect, I wonder if you could point us to your favorite haunts? Might there be anything like that around here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The guard gives you a curious look.  "I am... unaware of any new dishes.  Of course, pardon my saying so, you are from the material plane."   He pauses to think.  "Just down the Sun Walk you'll find my favorite place for fare and drink.  The Queen's Smile is just north of here.  It's no tavern or inn, either, they just specialize in..  ah, vittles, I believe you mentioned?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ha! My mistake good elf! It would seem I am not <i>quite</i> adjusted to life on this side of the veil just yet! Yes yes, The Queen's Smile has the ring of goodness about it. What say you meet us there and we'll have your favorite ordered and ready for your return?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He jumps as if pinched, and says, with a widening smile, "For true?!  Well...  that would be wondrous indeed.  And I thank you, kind sirs," he stammers.  "I'll go now.  My favorite dish is the baked Chaos Sunfish.  Make sure you try the goldflower buns, too.  They're fantastic!"  With a big smile on his face, he makes his way back to the castle.  Daran chuckles as he goes.  "Think you made that one's month, aye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Heh, well we'll see how my wallet fares...I don't know what this might run me yet...But yes, he did seem quite keen."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"We could always say we're the land's newest saviors, eh?  Might be a discount in that?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well...someday we may need to lean into that persona a bit, but for now let us keep a modest profile. It would not do the swagger just yet."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran shrugs, smiling.  Waving to the woman shop-keep, the group leaves to make their way to the Queen's Smile.  Along the way, they pass through the market again, basking in the glory that is elven art.  Farther north, where the rainbow-hued road branches in a few dozen directions around a circle, the road north is a golden hue, with the sign posted <i>Sun Walk</i> in beautiful etching.  Daran trudges along the golden road, taking in the sights and sounds.  Eventually the group comes to a finely decorated two-story building.  Trees and gardens surround the entire building, mixing with the aromas carried on the soft breeze.   The first floor, around the entrance, has elegant outdoor dining areas, and the second floor has a balcony where customers are already laughing and chattering gaily.  A great sense of peace and calm exudes from the place, making Maouelue wonder if the whole building isn't magically charmed some way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue smiles and leads on to the restaurant's entrance, indicating they would like a table for four outdoors. Their friends would arrive after awhile.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A spry young elf lad hop-skips through the indoor seating to get the group a nice table outside.  As the sunshine warms faces, Maouelue is able to rest for the first time in what seems like a very, <i>very</i> long time.  Breads and some spreads come out, and the spry elf gives both men magically laminated parchment menus.  The waiter says, "Welcome to the Queen's Smile.  We have the menu options as well as a curated, four-course meal, if you would prefer.  Please let me know I there's anything I can do for your.  Would you like to start off with something to drink?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"As it is my first time here, I would defer to the chef's discretion. Such is my custom. However, we were directed to order the Baked Chaos Sunfish and the Goldflower Buns, so let us put in two orders of those to come out after awhile. My friends will return with carriage and an appetite! As for beverage, what nectar of the local flower do you have on offer?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The waiter bows low and says, "Welcome to our humble restaurant, then, travelers.  The Elverquisst is a must, if you haven't had it before.  And I guarantee, even if you've had it elsewhere, even on another plane, it is much different here."  He smiles.  "A bottle for the table, yes?"  Maouelue sees the Elverquisst is 40 gold.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us have at! Treats all round!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The waiter bows low again, then hastens away to the kitchens.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are a lot of conversations going on around the group.  Between the crowd in the streets and the patronage of the food-house, Maouelue's senses are hard-pressed to find a line of conversation that sticks out.  There is one table that is a few over from the party that is talking in animated, hushed tones.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue leans in to Daran slightly and whisper under his breath, "Can you catch what they're saying over there?"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran closes his eyes and looks to be in meditation.  The cacophony swells.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His eyes open wide, and his mouth gapes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Cautious not to overreact, Maouelue raises and eyebrow questioningly at Daran.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well.  They're very interested in us.  But it seems that there is another new arrival to the city.  Or maybe not so new..." Daran frowns, trying to piece it all together.  "They are workers near the docks.  They said there is a ship that's supposedly been asea for over 90 years that's just put into port.  Most of them are scoffing, but there's one that recognizes the name.  And confirms it's over 100 years old.  Odd that, right?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"To be fair it is hard to know what is novel in this land, especially after your note about the passage of time here. Could it be that the ship also had some extra-planar experience?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Could be, true.  Haven't heard about any crossovers in the waters, but it would beg to reason there should be, aye."   He trails off, thinking.</p><p></p><p>The waiter comes back with two bottles and a sliced loaf of bread on a cutting board.  "Here we are, the goldflower bread, freshly baked.  It pairs excellently with our pixie spreads.  The chaos sauce is particularly nasty, so I brought a sample of it here, just in case either of you would like to try it before the main course comes."  He gives a sly chuckle.  "I have here the Elverquisst, aged and bottled right here in Faerie.  And this is a bottle of Feywild wine.  A standard here, but since you are from beyond, please accept the chef's gift to you, our travelling guests!"  He makes a show of presenting the bottle to Maouelue, then, with many flourishes, draws and pours the Elverquisst.  The ramekin of chaos sauce is sending up little sparks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue nods respectfully to the server, waits for his retreat, then begins to sample a bit of everything.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Con saves for the chaos sauce and the Elverquisst, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bread is fluffy and light, and soaks up anything put on it or dipped in.  Maouelue and Daran try the chaos sauce together.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And they are both very pleased with it!  Daran's not overly fond of high spice, and it is rare to find many elves that are, but the taste and the heat pair well together.  The two settle in to the wine as well.  The first sip goes to Maouelue's head, but he's able to shake away the centered effect.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran, on the other hand, pauses for a few moments, drink halfway to set on the table.  A good 30 seconds later, Daran closes his eyes and shakes his head.  Then looks at Maouelue and laughs!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Some vintage!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(afk dinner etc.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Quite pleasant indeed!” Maouelue states cooly. </p><p>“I wonder when that carriage will arrive. It sounds like we’ll be riding in style eh there Daran?” He slaps him on the back with a air of friendly banter.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry brother, another crazy night!  I'll pick up again tomorrow morning.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran smiles and he tucks into more food.  The waiter arrives again, bringing a frilly plate of appetizers piled high.  "Enjoy!" he says with a flourish and bow, and promptly exits.  Murmurs from around the assembled patrons catch the pairs attention, and they look down the street to see a large, golden carriage pulled by four stark white draft horses.  If it were full sunlight, the scene would be blinding.  But in the seemingly forever late evening sunlight, it is resplendent in a golden aura, an orange-hued halo surrounding everything.  Some of the elves in attendance stand and clap, believing a member of the Court to be inside.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What did I tell you! Riding in style.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks in slack-jawed horror between the people clapping, the carriage, the opulent scene unfolding before him.  The guard that suggested the restaurant hops is marching at the front of the procession.  He sees the group, waves, and makes his way over, the horses being driven around to a more sequestered location.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The waiter comes out again, this time with the fish, and the guard lets out a little yelp.  He thanks the waiter, sits down to tuck in, and says, "Thank you gentlemen most kindly.  This is truly a treat."  To the other guard, he says, "Did I miss anything?"  The other shakes their head and stands at attention off to the side, taking his job extremely seriously.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Well, this just keeps getting better and better,</i> he smiles to himself.</p>

<p>A twinkle of the crows foot, a cool gesture with an outstretched palm.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix grasps the hand as she passes by, into the main part of the restaurant.  Daran arches an eyebrow and smiles, shaking his head.  The guard is making loud slurping sounds, making some around them turn to look.</p>

<p>The waiter comes out with two large plates, on which roasted half birds sit, surrounded by flowers and vegetables.  "Enjoy," he says again, bowing and flourishing.</p>

<p>Maouleue stands up and begins to toast his company a bit ostentatiously, eyeing fleetingly the various groups around the room as he does so, monitoring their responses in a bit of a baiting manner. They are making a scene here and he wants the onlookers to know also that they are seen. </p><p></p><p>“My friends! Thank you for gathering here with me on this fine day. The best bottles and bottles to each of you, oh companions of renown. Though the eyes of our foes be many, the resolve of our hearts be true! Long live Queen Titania and Lord Oberon, and may our friendship and kinship be renewed and strengthened as we fight for the heart of this city!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let us raise our glasses to, those who have fallen,  those  who are falling, and those who teeter on the precipice.” At this last, he lets his eyes linger on the hushed group he and Daran had been monitoring, nearly imperceptibly nodding his head in their direction before returning his gaze to Bellatrix and the others.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Applause bursts out from the surrounding tables, cackling from the sister, and general merriment at the boisterous words.  Bellatrix gives Maouelue a wry smile and a tilt of the head, as if in wonder of what his plans hold next.  Several waiters come out to fill empty and empty-ing goblets and glasses.  Even the crowd outside of the restaurant gets in on the positive attitude, some even entering the establishment because of it.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<p>The table Daran overheard is eyeing all of your group <i>hard</i>.  Not in an overly menacing way at all, just extremely curious and being very obvious about it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are five people in all, four men and a woman.  All look to be either spring eladrin or run-of-the-mill elves.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue leans over to one of his handlers and mentions as much, asking whether these folks are known to the palace guard.</p>

<p>The one eating checks what Maouelue says, but is very careful not to give away too much.  With a boisterous yell and a flamboyant show, he pours more wine for everyone, getting up and offering his seat to the older sister.  Who sits in it with a giggle/cackle.  A gackle, if you will.  As the guard moves around the table, filling drinks, his eyes move deftly over the group.  He pulls a chair out at a nearby empty table for Bellatrix, then sits himself opposite, directly behind Maouelue.  Without a beat, the wizard hears behind him in a low whisper, "The woman is Tinebrae, works at a seedier tavern by the docks.  The husky one is Maradeim, the blonde one is Tannivh.  Both work in warehouses by the docks.  The other two I don't know.  Do you require something from them, lord wizard?"</p>

<p>The men are pretty inebriated already, but the woman eyes Maouelue cautiously.  She turns to her group, says something, and the rest of them scoff, raising their glasses high and enjoying the present.  The woman, frustrated, folds her arms and stews.  She continues to look back and forth, secretively, between the two tables.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The magnanimous metal mage meanders over to the meddling meetup he's monitoring.</p><p>"Fine day my fellow! Enjoy the wine, I did not want our revelry to encroach upon your table's experience negatively." At these last words he looks hard at the frowning woman.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The men speak up at once, jumping up and patting Maouelue on the back, offering him a seat.  </p><p>"Hey now, lad!"</p><p>"Thank you for the vintage!"</p><p>"For the heart of the city!" </p><p>"To the Queen and King!"</p><p>"Long live the Court!"</p><p>Their exuberance is caught by other tables, and the revelry heightens. </p><p>The dour woman gives Maouelue a half-smile.</p>

<p>The fresh elf finishes his song to a smattering of applause.  A super fan yells behind him somewhere, and he bows off, blushing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Another bard comes up, this one an autumn eladrin, bronze skin shining in the evening light.  She has a beautifully crafted lute, and she hums up to the edge of the restaurant's outdoor seating to a smattering of claps.  </p><p>In a heavy brogue, the eladrin bard says in a loud voice, "Did I hear someone want to know the tale of the Black Ship of the Shee Alus, eh?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Applause from most of the tables.  Every one except Maouelue's new friends.  Silence comes from them.  A few of them even look... scared.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Play on mistress!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bard gets a glint in her eye.  She bows to Maouelue, then picks up a sea shanty rhythm and tempo.  The crowd starts stomping along, clapping in time with the beat as the woman gets into a groove...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>An amazing thing happens as she starts to sing.  Maouelue sees the reality of what's happening, but another layer, like a film across his eyes, show him the happenings of her words.</p><p></p><p>She tells of a group of elves, power hungry and hell-bent on ruling the waters of the Feywild.  These peoples made their slaves create a mighty ship, black as obsidian with black sails to match.  It looked like a thunderhead as it rode the waves, and in a storm, is was completely hidden.  It manned many wizards who controlled the weather, to make it storm around their black ship at all times.  And with that dire boat, they ruled the oceans of the Fey.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Until one day, they met with a more powerful fiend.  From the depths it rose, chasing, then catching the mariners and their formidable craft.  In an instant, they were cast asunder, forever lost to the sea.  They only reason people knew of this tale is because the black ship was never seen on the waves again.  Peace came to the harbors and islands.  Life was sweet.  But every once in a while, people say they can hear the music of the boat, drifting in from the deep waters.  Singing of doom from the pirates below the sea.  And their new god.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a minor chord and a final bow, the woman closes her song to silence.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue slowly stands and begins to applaud. “Enchanting...madam.” He flips her a gold coin.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rest of the group starts to clap until a full rousing chorus of applause comes into bloom.  Coins start cascading at her feet, and she bows again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, Tinebrae jumps up from the table and runs into the main restaurant, nearly knocking over a couple waiters bringing more food out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Follow her.” Maouleue whispers to the slick handler. Don’t worry, we’ll get you a box.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The elf nods, wipes his mouth, excuses himself to Bellatrix, and hastens away.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the bard retires from the spotlight, the street calms down to a relative normal.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue and the group continue with their meal, the mage keeping an ear on the other group all the time now, as he makes pleasantries with the rest. After a while he calls for the tab and says they must be on their way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tab is produced, putting the mage out 200 gold.  (Daran helps out, too!)  They all start to disperse, running into the guard on their way out of The Queen's Smile.  Approaching Maouelue, he says, "She went into the kitchens, they won't let me in there.  I did look in, though, and she's sitting on a crate by the back door.  Might be able to go around, if you wish to speak with her, lord wizard."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Perhaps I will. Yes, perhaps I will. Pray take the others to the carriage. I will be along shortly.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short salute and he leads them away, promising the carriage will be waiting on the street for the wizard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The wizard treks around to the back, taking down his ostentatious manner...as much as possible. There’s something about this situation that intrigues him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help but note your interest in our party. Why do you flee?”</p>

Pardon my bluntness, but in my line of work, it's best to be open about what's at stake.  If you catch my meaning."  She looks down at her scuffed boots, shyly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed. Go on.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The boat, the black ship the bard sang of?  It is docked at the wharf <i>right now</i>.  I've seen it.  It came in last night, late.  A few folk went to investigate, on a dare for the love of the gods...  but they never came back.  Some say the entire thing is empty, but it's huge.  Not a person has disembarked, either.  There's a legend that says 'first the ship comes back, then the god follows'.  And, frankly...  I'm scared to see what happens next."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dark tidings abound of late. Thank you for your words of caution. I may have cause to investigate ere long. Would it be forward of me to call on you at your establishment? Could you keep an eye on the activity around that ship?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She seems surprised.  This woman is unused to someone looking out for the greater good, so she's cautious.  At the same time, she nods and says, "Yes.  I'll keep an eye.  And you can call on me at the Oaken Grove.  I'm usually there in the evenings."  She steps closer.  "Thank you, stranger."  She smiles, then runs off down the alley to the street.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He watches her on down the alley, considering her words, then turns and slowly starts off to rejoin with the others.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The carriage awaits at the end of the street, ready to ride.  Daran sits on the sidebar, smoking a pipe.  He waves when he sees you.  "Anything interesting?"</p>

<p>“In a minute...” He looks around a moment, then ushers into the carriage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran hastily spills out his bowl and stows the pipe, hopping into the cab.  A snap and the horses move off.  Bellatrix smiles at Maouelue, then looks worried at his countenance.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As soon as the clatter from the ride creates ample noise, he starts in with the others about the black ship and his encounter with Tinebrae.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old woman's eyes get large and she starts giggling, then cackling, then fully laughing outright, unnerving the others in the cart.  Bellatrix reaches out for her sister, "Honestly, Benna!  What's gotten into you?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The carriage driver salutes behind to Maouelue, cracks the whip, and the horses jaunt off at a high trot.  Bellatrix still gives you an odd, worried look, but then gets interested in the books offered.  Daran and Benna also sift through them, checking out what they are all about.  The trip to the south of the city, to Lanrion's Tower, starts in earnest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The countryside is steeped in autumnal colors.  Just south of the city proper, a vista opens up in front of the group and all can see a wide expanse of land, dotted with copses of trees and lovely elven buildings rising into the air.  And beyond...  the sea.  An amazing, glistening stretch of water opens up before the party's eyes.  Farther, across the sea, Maouelue can see a white area off to the SE, marking the borders of the Pale Prince's domain.  And immediately south, a scruffy forest of evergreen and deciduous trees marking the famed wilderness of the Feywild.  On the edge of the island, in the direction they're headed, stands a spire that cuts the skyline like a razor.  It shimmers between the sunlight bouncing off the water and the setting sun beams from the west.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Approximately four hours later, as Maouelue finishes his first transcription, the horses whinny to a stop and the carriage doors open to let the party exit.  Once outside their ride, they see the razor tower in all it's glory.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<p>The foodie guard comes up behind Maouelue and says, "Tales tell of an old wizard that lives in the tower.  He likes his solitude too much, so his tower is nigh impenetrable.  Do either of you have any knowledge of the arcane about you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The metal mage casts a withering eye at the guard. “<i>Aye</i>.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He chuckles and realizes what he just said.  "Aye, yes.  True.  That's my fault, apologies lord wizard.  Ah...  My understanding is that Old Lanrion recognizes arcane arts.

<p>Maouelue, looking through the hawk's eyes, sees a doorway into the tower, but there is a shimmer to it.  Casting his gaze through the door, pushing his will to look through the haze, the wizard can tell it needs more magic.  (Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can pierce the veil a bit, seeing through the shimmery gauze in the doorway.  It looks to be a large library, rows and rows of books line the walls.  Nothing living can be seen beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue calls the hawk back to keep an eye on him while he begins inscribing the Jump spell in his book, practicing his leaps with the help of his new boots as well. Overall feeling pretty good about the process and meanwhile completely oblivious to his party’s going’s on.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He grabs a few jumping bugs from around the edge of the water and pulls their legs to use as reagents for his tests. </p><p><i>Hip...</i></p><p><i>Hop...</i></p><p><i>Hibbie...</i></p>

With a running start & Jump spell + boots:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a running jump and lands on the balcony, swinging his legs over smoothly.  He can hear clapping below.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He swells with a bit of misplaced bravado and turns and waves back over the balcony, lapping up the applause  and gleaming in his metal suit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Quickly turning, he heads back now to the veil, patting himself on the back and chucking his spell.</p><p><i>Be your own guide, metal mage! Heh heh...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage turns back to the doorway, determined.  He's getting a much better look now, and can clearly see that there is a magical essence to the barrier.  The hawk screeches below, Daran yells something Maouelue can't quite make out.  He reaches out a hand to the veil.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just as his hand is about to touch the haze, the shimmering lifts, dissipates, disappears.   Behind it is a dark room.  Gone are the books, the library.  A spiral staircase can be seen with a little landing just beyond the doorway.  Standing on the landing is an old elven man.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Doctor Lanrion, I presume?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Long white hair pours from his head and face, making him look ancient for an elf.  His skin has a dusky pallor, a few liver spots dotting his face.  His back is slightly hunched. He's grasping a clear crystal staff tightly with both hands.  His mouth chews on something.  He looks frustrated, but curious too.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a voice like the opening of a dusty, ancient tome, he says, "I have never been called Doctor before, lad.  A moniker I quite enjoy, actually.  Quite a feat of athleticism, getting up on my balcony.  Why didn't you just knock?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“‘‘Tis for the thrush to knock upon the door. That of the Metal Mage marks many mirrored masks.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old wizened wizard contemplates for a moment.  He smiles, and says, "We can always learn a thing or two from nature.  Even thrushes.  Come.  The tea is getting cold."  And he walks down the circular stairs, inside the his tower.</p><p></p><p>(Gonna pause it there for tonight, my good sir.  I'm loving where this is going, by the way.  I know it's a bit slower than the fight scenes, but it's so much fun to rp with all of these folks!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old elven man makes his way slowly down the spiral stairs.  At the bottom, a small table is set with seven seats and a pot of steaming tea.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard reaches the bottom of the tower, the staircase rising seemingly to infinity above the two of you, he approaches the side wall and places a gnarled hand on it.  A doorway appears and opens outward, admitting the rest of the group.  They start cautiously coming in as Lanrion starts pouring tea for everyone.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue smiles kindly at their bewildered faces. “Come friends, let us take our tea with the host of this tower. Master Lanrion, though, <i>Doctor Lanrion</i> is fast catching on.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard chuckles as he pours more cups.  "<i>I</i> would like it, yes.  But patrons might not when they realize I cannot help them with their common colds, or various afflictions.  That is, I cannot help them... without magic."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He finishes, offers the seats with a wave, and places the pot in the air behind him.  It vanishes as he sits and says, "So, what brings your fine company to an old man's door today?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Well good wizard, there are long and short answers to that question. I’ll begin with the latter. I was told that your enchanting services are unparalleled and if I wanted to ‘go big’ as it were, that this was the place to come. As you no doubt have noticed, I am a bit more metallic than other arcanists you may have come across. However, I lack a bit of...covering in a key area. I’ve commissioned a set of platinum greaves, in reverence of my patron...I seek to have them imbued with a balance of strength and intelligence, for that lust which drives one in battle must be tempered by a cool head.” He cannot help but flick his eyes over to Bellatrix during this last. “The long answer, perhaps my company here can help to elaborate, but let us say, that if you were to render these services, your help would be felt a great deal beyond just those you see here today, for there are powers afoot that all who claim to be agents of good would do well to refute.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Random slurping and sipping sounds greet the silence after Maouelue's statement.  Lanrion nods contemplatively.  The witch's eye flit between all members of the party, trying to take everything in.  The guards, who did not sit, stand in awkward quiet behind the troupe.  Daran looks out of place and a bit nervous, while Benna...  is trying to hold in laughter.  Or gas.</p><p></p><p>Lanrion sweeps his gaze around to all, landing last on Maouelue.  "Thank you for your candor, Metal Mage."  He smiles.  "I have had success in enchanting.  And other arcane arts, in truth.  I'm a big fan of history, too.  Did you know, the very place we're sitting used to be the site of a major event in Feywild history?  It's true," he looks seriously around the group.  "It is right here that the Pale Prince tore out his heart.  Some say that, when his love sailed across the sea, with the Queen of Ravens, he clutched his own chest, ripped the heart out of his very body, and buried it in the ground.  Isn't that interesting?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Interesting is quite a word; says everything while fully saying nothing. We keep hearing tell of this Pale Prince as it would so happen. Have a few tomes along with us, matter of fact. Strange we would be led right to the, forgive the punnery, <i>heart</i> of it all so directly.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Tell me, is there any part of the story that involves a black ship?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“And mind, all of you, pipe in if you wish.” He surveys Benna as he says this.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna is sitting on her hands, rocking back and forth, looking utterly crazy and very much at home.  The rest are in rapt fascination between the two of you.</p>

<p>"Black ship, black heart...  One in the same, yes?  And the pun is forgiven, goodsir.  I wouldn't hold a pun against even my worst enemy.  Now, you were saying about the enchanting.  You need your armor strengthened against...  battle rage?  Or would you just need them to give you a boost to your will?"  (Insight check, if you want!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ahem, well, I had imagined this conversation would be a bit less well-attended, but I'll try to be frank. When the...head gets a rush of blood in the heat of battle, the brain would do well to remain sane. Something to bolster the blood supply...perhaps a boon of intelligence to keep my wits."</p><p></p><p>The mage awkwardly tries to explain himself in front of his company.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The story is a strange one," the wizard fairly wheezes out.  Benna giggles, softly.  "The Pale Prince used to be the Sun Prince, once upon the day.  His love of a follower of his was his undoing.  She eventually turned to love another.  Maybe it was something the Prince did.  Who is to say.  All I know is that outside my balcony, to the southeast, I am privy to his pain.  Every day."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He pardons himself, gets up, and conjures a wizard's laboratory against the wall.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tell me, kind woman, what do you know of enchantments?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks at the newly conjured workstation...  and it off-put by it.  Not sure why, though.  Something is hitting him as odd.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix looks back and forth between her party-mates, but Benna gets up and goes to Lanrion's side.  "Oh, my, a bit here, a bit there!  Lessee what ya got, sonny!!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard laughs at that and the two set to going through beakers and vials, random bit and bobs from his table.  All with their backs turned.  Bellatrix stares at Maouelue, giving him a look that says, <i>What in the Nine Hells is happening right now?!</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leans in and whispers a reply. “Apologies dear Bellatrix, i had not sought to tie everyone up with this endeavor, but I felt the need to gather resources before heading out again. Pray, let us watch what your sister and Lanrion concoct here!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles and says in a whisper, "I'm not worried at all, I can't remember the last time I've seen Benna have so much fun!  He does switch topics quite frequently, though!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Wizards...” He replies with a wink.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Tittering comes from the workbench, and the wizard starts mixing things in vials.   Puffs of smoke erupt, and more laughter ensues.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lanrion turns in a flourish, and says, "Dear boy, have you any item - jewelry or the like - very near and dear to your heart?  Not bound to your armor or any weaponry?"</p><p>Benna comes back to the table with a brewed concoction, giggling and staring between Maouelue and Lanrion.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“There was, at the start of our journey, a young Halfling called Briffo Lightfoot...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All lean forward, in expectation.  The wizard nods, almost imperceptibly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...when hope was high, our search beginning. There was no ransom to be paid. But, the heists they came at night, as we delved the Muhlen Manor; as we tore the place apart, as they turned our greed to shame. </p><p></p><p>We laid him down by riverside. With words we teared admist our blunders. <i>They took our Brightfoot in his striiiiiide!!!</i> So to the vault, we took our shame.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But still...I dream he’ll always see, the ways his sacrifice was tendered. He drifts beyond the endless sea...</p><p></p><p>...his life has filled the dreams I dream.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>With this, Maouleue pulls forth the Ring of Aid, his final material remains from Briffo’s fleeting existence in his world. The thought floods over him, as he pursues so called forces of justice, what is he leaving in the wake? How many lost? Too many...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>...Dieter...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Be strong.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The last he says aloud, an icy tear crystallizing into the crows feet developing at the corner of his eye through years of scrutiny and intense attention to detail, and well, a bit of light-hearted reverie along the way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>But the costs had never been so high as now. Thus his mission here. He must retain focus at all costs. The mission here with his half brother would have to wait. For now. It was time to fulfill their contract and the sooner he could get this bit of whimsy sorted, the better. His fingers fiddle idly with the Expeditious Retreat scroll he had been looking forward to studying.</p><p></p><p>He turns back expectantly to Lanrion and Benna.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard's eyes take on a softer, knowing cast.  Lanrion nods his head again as he picks up the ring.  "Yes.  Yes, this will do well."  He's looking at Maouelue when he says this, then sits down next to him at the tea table.  </p><p>"The thing about sacrifice is that, for it to be truly understood, truly <i>sacrificial</i>, no one can know of it.  It can't be broadcast to the heavens.  There shouldn't be grand gestures.  It often times is just people.  Going about their business, making the difficult choices.  Doing what they can as they must.  And when posed with a difficult task or decision, always choosing the harder road.  Not because it is hard, but because it is right.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The interesting thing about you and your friends is that, although you might not know it yet, your choices and actions will effect the world for years and years to come.  There are some things coming you cannot and will not change.  But, for your part, there are important, world changing things you can affect.  Just by choosing right.  For example, the reason you wear that armor.  Had you not chosen the Platinum Protector, there might be a real chance a choice in your future could be swayed another way.  I say this not to worry your, or question your allegiances.  Simply to inform you of the importance of perseverance.  And of hope.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Without the belief that what you do <i>means</i> something, even to just one person, your choices are then random, as is your effect on the warp and weft of the world.  But you, sir...  your actions mean something.  Sometimes, yes, to just one person.  And other times to people you will never get the chance to meet."  He looks sorrowfully down at the ring in his hands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
"Know this:  boons will help you; better gear and bigger, stronger spells will help you.  But the only thing that is and will ever be truly important are the choices you make and why you make them."  With that, he hands you the ring.  Benna downs the concoction in one gulp, then burps, loudly.

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue nods stoically, taking in this wisdom.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(If you take the ring and/or put it on, perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes the ring and puts it round his index finger on his right hand.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As soon as Maouelue touches the ring, he feels different.  He can't pinpoint it, but does feel different that he had before.  </p><p></p><p>"Two more things.  One, strength and intelligence will get you far.  But, for the long road, you might find that your greatest need is a strong spine and a deeper understanding of things.</p><p></p><p>(The ring gives you +4 Wis, +2 Int, and +4 Con)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Lastly, I believe your biggest fear can be allayed with this...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lanrion waves his hand at the wall and a picture comes, crystal clear, upon it.  It is a moving picture, complete with sound.  It is of a young bearded man, of whom Maouelue is familiar with.  A gigantic snail comes up from behind him, but it looks friendly to the man.  Another man comes into the picture, dressed in common clothes.  In his hands, a specially made sword-staff.  He is looking intently at a tapestry that Maouelue can see bears a skull in a triangle setting, all on a black background.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dieter...</p><p></p><p>Can it be? </p><p></p><p>And with Frumious to boot! Looks like our dear Druid is not without hope after all!</p><p></p><p>And what of this symbol....the trinity of death...</p><p></p><p>But fear not, says the wise wizard before me. I am aided and abetted, now I see that I had better be off and offer my aid!</p><p></p><p>Something is odd though...Frumious..., why would he rejoin? Hadn't he stolen off with quite a bit if Platinum hence. What circumstances could put the two back together within the Citadel, if that is where they truly  sit now.</p><p></p><p>The pair look amicable enough...ah, but I ramble...</p><p></p><p>How is it that you can show me this? How is it that you know?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lanrion pats the younger wizard on the shoulder.  "Perhaps, when all of this is over, you can join me over another cup of tea.  There is much more I would share with you."  He smiles, then conjures the teapot again to freshen cups.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue seaches the wizard's face. For a moment, he is reminded of Shi'Vandos, far away, through the veil, back in his academy tower, listening to an adage about the difference between tales and trails. It is a well-timed reminder to keep his head. Something about the Feywild...</p><p></p><p><i>His eyes drift over to Bellatrix as he contemplates.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She's still watching the moving picture on the wall.  Benna hiccups and giggle.  Daran has gotten up to speak with the guards.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The young wizard walks over to her, clearing his throat gently as he approaches. </p><p></p><p>"What do you make of it Bella?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She cocks her head to the side, still watching the wall.  "It's old magic.  He seems to know what he's talking about, too.  Do you think we could convince him to join us?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks to Mao with smirk.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Something tells me this old elf goes when and where he pleases."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She laughs.  Daran comes back behind the chairs of the two and says, "Sounds like we should be going.  Queen wants to talk to us soon, brief us on the raid.  We good here, Maouelue?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Yes indeed. I am sorry for my indulgence. Let’s us away.”</p><p></p><p>“Lanrion, thank you for your wisdom. I will meet you in the future for that follow-up tea.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The old wizard gets up, escorting everyone to his door.  "The pleasure would be all mine.  And when you do meet back up with your friend, don't make a big deal of his new pet."  He pats Maouelue on the shoulder.  "Please feel free to come back, any time."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue wonders at the meaning of the former, but keeps it to himself. “We’ll see you again. Goodbye.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads them back over to the coach and this time stays intent on his companions rather than himself, laughing about their sojourn. It has been a nice change of pace, though their next moves were bound to be fraught with danger.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Everyone packs up and loads out, the old wizard stands waiving while the coach pulls away.  Maouelue is able to get one more spell in his book before the carriage arrives back at Starlight Castle.  They're ushered out and guards guide them to another room just off of the throne room.  As the group enters, a large map is unfurled on the table, magic is giving it a three-dimensional view.  The southern forests and their large bushy trees blend into the massive maze in the West.  The sea glistens in the North, just beyond the City of Starlight.  The Queen and King are huddled over the map, pointing at several areas, while another lithe summer eladrin in battle armor, helm off, stands next to them, taking in their direction.  They all notice the group coming in.  The Queen's servants usher everyone to seats, deliver drinks, and the meeting starts in earnest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen begins, "Thank you all for joining us, I know it's late.  After a much needed rest, we are planning for the full raid.  There has been a slight change of plans.  After speaking with our head of the military, Jelentrianna, we have decided a direct strike to a major base would be the best route.  If we can take out a major general and raze one of their dominant bases, it would go a long way to turn the tide.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I'll let Jelentrianna explain more."  She steps back to let the armored eladrin address the group.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"According to our most recently acquired information from the front, the main insurrection base is Mag Tureah, which is directly south of here, and close to the Plains of Echoing Thunder.  We have reason to believe that across from the seelie city of Cendriane, SE of the city to be specific, and S of the Stream, is a new underground base.  It is starting to grow considerably because the unseelie are planning on taking the eastern side of the Feywild.  Our capital, Senaliesse, the City of Stars, would be in a direct line of danger if this were to happen.  If we quell the burgeoning base now, we could potentially save two seelie cities in one go."  She looks expectantly around.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“And here we have it, the raid of a lifetime. I am ready for this challenge as I am ready to take to the battlefield again with you lot. Let a hammerstroke fall upon the unseelie and send a rebuffing wave back across the sound. </p><p></p><p>What do we know of its defenses?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The bad guys are the unseelie 😉)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(lol. fixed)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(that would have been unseemly of me to say.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The captain nods vigorously, "Great point, glad we're thinking in the same vein.  According to our intel, there are barracks there, plus gods know what kinds of monsters.  We have narrowed the number of actual eladrin down to 60.  And that's so far.  Haven't been able to get anyone inside yet, might not be able to.  They're locking things down pretty hard.  But I would guess, from what I've been told about your previous bout, a lot of the same.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There is going to be three teams, twenty soldiers each.  We're examining the entry points, but three are confirmed.  This is going to be a smash-and-go, get in and get out, do as much damage as possible and raze the place to the ground when we're done.  We need to send a big message, and a massacre will do just that."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Pausing it there for tonight, sir.  Gotta get a map going for Roll20 for us, too!)</p>

<p>(I think there probably should be!  He and Daran took on a pretty big party of goblins and such, right after those fomorians.  Tales will probably be told throughout Astrazalian of that for a long time!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Receiving encouragement all around, bolstering her resolve, Jelentrainna continues.  "There are two north passages.  The NE passage we'll openly attack, sending shock troops in a hopefully drawing the better part of the fighting.  Then we'll send two more groups in, stealthily, one through the NW passage, and another through the SE, which has some water hazards.  Don't know if you all want to stay together or lead your own battalions, but there are options for either.  I would not put any of you in the first group, everyone here would be better utilized as a merc.  Any questions so far?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns to Daran, "You will lead a troop through the Southeast passage. Bellatrix, we shall take the Northwest passage. Lady Brenna, would you go or  stay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not much use in a fight, nowadays.  But I'll be sure to get you all set up before you go," Benna says, regretfully.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran gives a quick head nod.  Bellatrix seems...  (Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks like she's keeping her emotions in check, trying not to let anything show on her face.  Her eyes, however, belie the fact that she's extremely scared.  Maouelue can't quite tell what she's terrified of.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Noting this, he addresses them all, "If there are objections or alternatives, I will of course, hear them out."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran shifts, looks like he's debating with himself.  Then, after a deep breath, he says, "I'm no captain or leader like that.  I appreciate your vote of confidence, and I'd be happy to check in at the other post, Maouelue.  But I think I would be happier as a soldier than a commander.  If that's okay?"</p><p></p><p>Bellatrix tries to catch Maouelue's eye, but doesn't speak up.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Understood Daran, you are of course welcome to join our company. Bellatrix if there is aught you have to say, I would hear of it..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Startled, she looks around nervously at all of the faces.  (Persuasion check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He puts his right hand to his forehead and mutters something under his breath...</p>

<p>She... flips... out.  Screaming and running from the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>( XD )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna is the first to react, running after her sister.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rest of the dignitaries look between themselves.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ahhhm, was is something I said?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen says, "Um...  I'm sorry if i was something <i>we</i> posited, too."  She calls a staff member to have them check on Bellatrix.  She then turns back to the group.  "There is one more piece of happy news, but we can wait while we attend to other matters, yes?   We will take a brief recess, would that be okay, Maouelue?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"No, please. Give me the happy news. Maybe it will prove of use..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen smiles, bows her head, and says, "Maybe it would be best coming from the source."  She turns to beckon from the other room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The quartet of Erifias, Otirnis, Cierean, and Cruiver come out and stand at attention next to their captain, Jelentrianna.  All of them wear wide smiles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>At this Maouleue's curiosity is peaked and his confusion at Bella's reaction is temporarily swept aside.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The captain begins, "The recoveries of Erifias and Cruiver have been top notch.  They specifically requested to be on the next mission with you.  I have assigned them to your detail, lord wizard.  If that is amenable to ye?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Have they indeed! That is most welcome news. I would be honored to fight beside them once more."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"And what of you Otirnis and Cierean? What are your intentions?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Erifias steps forward and says, "My whole team is ready to fight, lord wizard.  They are all in agreement."  Four faces beam at the group around the table.  Maouelue gets the feeling that the highest of the guard is being picked for this mission, and this team very much wants to be considered in that rank.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He reaches out his hands to the center of the group. "Take my hands all of you. May the light and life of the lord guide us."</p><p></p><p>He lowers his head and begins to channel his spirit of guidance through the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us all now make our final preparations ere we head out to the front!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Everyone is slightly taken aback, but very enthusiastic as they all grasp hands, then glow with the light of Maouelue's magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>At this Maouelue turns and walks tentatively toward the direction of Bellatrix's flight."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Several of the members of the Queen's guard and the captain continue strategizing, bent over the map as you met them.  The members of the Court gracefully make their way out, as well.  Daran stays behind to look over the battle plans.</p><p></p><p>Just outside the throne room, on the steps leading to upper chambers of the castle, Benna and Bellatrix sit, Bella's head in her sister's lap.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He stops on the spot, unsure whether he should continue; whether he should be so forward as to interrupt this private moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix is weeping softly, but she's not hysterical anymore.  Benna is just lightly combing her hands through her sister's hair.  Her eyes are closed.   Mao is not quite sure this is a private moment, but it is a quiet one.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage stands there a moment longer before saying, "Forgive my intrusion, but I wanted to check on you Bella. I apologize if my actions were improper in any way. I did not intend to offend."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Her eyes stay closed, but she speaks in a soft, quivering voice.  "No, you did nothing wrong.  But, I couldn't...  I can't tell everyone in there..."  Her hand shoots out to hold Maouelue's.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue is surprised at this, but stands firm and grips her hand in return.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It is such a long story, how I came to be...  like I am.  But after feeling the surge of evil before, at the battle with the giants...  I... I..."  She chokes up, and sputters, trying to get words out.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I will be as death to you if I go on this mission."  She looks Mao straight in the eyes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks back deeply, searching the pupils of her eyes, perhaps for the darkness deep within that she mentions.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check?  Unless there's something else you wanted to glean from the look?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Almost like I'm looking for the dark dragon in the abyss of her eye)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can't quite see into the depths, but there is darkness there.  And a faint light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I see. Then it shall be so. Please, take rest here in the care of the eladrin. Perhaps you will find more out more than we, if you find yourself up to the task. Keep your eyes and ears open and read deeply. Your knowledge and Benna’s wisdom may be more important than all the braun that has been put forward here. <i>I believe in you.</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Persuasion with advantage, good sir!!  That was nice!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The witch looks into the wizards eyes as well, both coming to some decision of their own.  Finally, she smiles and squeezes Mao's hand again, then lets go.  "We will learn as much as we can while we are here, right Benna?"  She turns to her sister, then back to Maouelue.  "Please be safe.  And come back to us.  To me."  She looks down for a moment, then shyly back up.  Her smile wavers.  Then, with arms linked, the sisters retreat up the stairs.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue watches their retreat back up the stairs until they are out of sight. He lingers a moment on the spot, Bella’s final words ringing in his head...</p><p></p><p><i>To me.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He swells a bit at this, then heads back to the war table to rejoin the discussion.</p>

<p>(teaching today so will be light until about 2.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue makes his way, heart oddly heavy and light at the same time, he meets Daran and the rest of the military group leaving the ready room.  "Hoy there, Maouelue.  We're headed off to the armory, see what we can check out there and what the deployments will need.  I could use a better bow, although this has been with me for many a year."  He smiles wistfully at the old wooden bow in his hands.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He nods stoically and joins the ranks, curious after all to see the royal armory.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Several turns and twists later, the group comes within sight of a large golden door decorated with flourishes of weaponry.  Daran gets a goofy smile on his face as the doors glide open without a sound.  Inside, all manner of cabinetry and shelving holds golden weapons of war.  Brightly polished swords stand at attention, metal and wood bows cover a section of the wall.   All types of ammunition are in racks in the center of the room.  On a far was, more eccentric items are available.  Some eladrin are already here, outfitting themselves.  As the new group enters, an air of frivolity, and almost fraternity nature, comes out in the warrior.  All gear up for the coming battle.  (If you want, I can set up a list of what's available.  There are all basic weapons and ammunition as listed in the Player's Handbook.  For Fey-specific weaponry, we'll have to roll on a table.)</p>

<p>On a small table, there are a few items of interest Maouelue hasn't seen before.  A small wooden box labeled “Ekkio’s Bestiary”, a set of bracers with an etching depicting a centaur, a quartz crystal wound around with a single thread of starlight, and lastly, a gray velvet purse.  And up on the wall, in a place of honor, are two swords, crossed on an ornamental background.  One sword burns a red-orange-yellow shimmer, the other a blue-purple-white one.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Midsummer/Midwinter
These two weapons are estocs (using rapier statistics) that represent the Throne of Summer and the Throne of Winter. They are meant to fight one another twice a year, at the equinoxes, in the hands of champions chosen by the Queens. It is not uncommon for one Queen to choose someone willing to fight for her Court, and the other to choose someone sympathetic to their nature but not affiliated with the Court, such as a mortal.

Rapier, legendary (requires attunement)

Both of these magic weapons grant a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. As a reaction when you are hit with an attack, you may apply your Charisma modifier as a bonus to your AC against that attack.

Midsummer deals an additional 1d8 fire damage on a hit. When you take the Dodge action while wielding Midsummer, you immediately end one condition on you for which you would receive a saving throw at the end of the round. You may not use this power more than once in any round, or in consecutive rounds.

Midwinter deals an additional 1d8 cold damage on a hit. When you hit with an attack, you may choose to lose hit points equal to your level, or twice your Challenge Rating if you do not have a level. If you do so, your target must succeed a Charisma saving throw against DC 15 or gain one condition that is currently affecting you. For as long as that condition affects your target, and your target is alive and conscious, you ignore the effects of that condition.

||Secret: When Midsummer and Midwinter are wielded against one another, in a duel or in battle, the victor’s maximum hit points increase by 10 as long as they remain attuned to the weapon, until the next equinox. If the loser survives or is resurrected, their maximum hit points decrease by 10 until the next equinox. If there is no clear victor, the Queens intervene and force a battle to some conclusion.||

<p>(Umm do i get to take all that?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen walks in, and all of the soldiers take a knee.  Including Daran.  She walks through to the section with the swords.  "These were forged long ago, back when my sister was simply the Winter Queen.  She was kind, sweet.  Not the cold-hearted person she is now.  These were never meant to fight against each other, they are best used together.  They can only be imparted to the champion of the Summer Queen.  Who shall rise to that title?  Present yourself before me, and I will see your destiny."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue kneels, "I am your champion, Queen Titania. It is my company's piercing of the veil that pushes these causes to the brink. In solemn service to the causes of justice I shall straddle the divide between worlds, between houses divided, between Summer and Winter, between Life and Death."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bids the wizard to approach and kneel at her feet.  (Does Maouelue comply?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He respectfully genuflects, down on one knee.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles, shakes her arms out of her voluminous, sheer sleeves, and places her palms on Maouelue's temples.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A feeling like plunging in ice-water, naked, consumes the mage.  A feeling like all of his nerves have gone full tilt, and visions run through his head like stampeding animals running from a ravenous monster...</p><p><i>A tower, books, learning.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As if pulled through an ice sheet, Maouelue opens his eyes and is back in the armory.  The Summer Queen rips her hands away and catches herself from falling on the table with the feywild oddities, knocking a few things on the floor.  Her face is contorted in a mixture of emotions.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"My Queen?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks confused, angry yet elated, and horror-stricken, all at the same time.  Maouelue's comany (and all of the other soldiers, for that matter) have never seen her anything more or less than placid.  This is an extreme reaction, and she's not really trying to hold anything back, either.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She's breathing heavy and says, "You?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks up into her eyes, not knowing, but intuiting the depths at which his presence, his heritage, the timing of his coming, could upset the balance here of all places. His curiosity forms as careworn crow's feet in the corners of his eyes, his spritely vigor letting down its illusion to show the meticulous, resourceful, yet confused child-grown. The thirst for the answer to all the riddles of his lineage now written in the lines on his face, begging for the answer.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Shi'Vandos is my father. I...did not know it until late; not long ago as a matter of fact did I learn of my history. I aim not to bring this old rift to your doorstep, and thus have focused on the matters at hand...but now, I see there is no avoiding it. Please...I am at your service...but I need to know...who I truly am."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She straightens, shakily.  One of her aides brings her a chair, just in time as she collapses as soon as she gets fully upright.  All manner of people are both around her for support, and avoiding the kneeling man on the floor, as if he were diseased and highly contagious.  The Queen whispers something to a soldier to her left, and he bolts away, without a second look back.  The atmosphere is tense... strange.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She takes another deep breath.  From a conflicted countenance, she begins.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There once was a noble family, they were not a part of the Court but they yearned to be.  There are both times and methods we have in place to admit such families into our fold.  Of which, this family took part and was eventually accepted as a full noble blood member of the Summer Court.  They hid, however, a dark secret, one which destroyed not only their standing within our hallowed halls, but created a rift so large they were all banished to other realms for eternity, never again being allowed to set foot in the Feywild.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yet, my husband, a kind and generous man, did not guarantee their banishment by completing the ritual that would keep them out.  He, in kindness, though that future generations might be able to make amends.  He banished only the culprits, but not the kin.  There is a saying that the children pay for the sins of their fathers.  In this case...  well... that may as yet be seen.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Have you heard tell of the dragonmarks?  Or the prophecy of the Dragon, Maouelue?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I have seen and read many things relating to the dragons, but this point eludes me. Please, enlighten me." </p><p></p><p>He continues to kneel, head lowered in deference.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"And what do you know of other realms, planes?  Eberron?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Is this, truly, the only other plane you've visited besides your own?"  An anger starts rising in the Queen.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Only whispers, allusions, references..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Answer me true, Maouelue the Dragon Mage, what do you intend to do after the victorious raid?  Take my throne?  Steal the Court?  Destroy the Feywild?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I ask for your trust, for demand it I cannot. As a royal, I know not whether you can understand the pain of being a pawn in your own life, though forgive my presumptuousness. My past, as my future, continue to reveal themselves to me in tandem...a dual helix of timelines traveling in reverse. The great circle traversed in both directions."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I seek above all to serve the causes of life."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He draws a sigil of Bahamut in the air, his triple-triumvirate now spinning around the platinum-blue ice trails hovering within.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I am called The Dragon Mage, though perhaps I do not know why. My kinship with the Lord of Dragons was at first a bit of fancy, a delusion of grandeur perhaps. Yet, he opened himself willingly to me and has been my guide ever since. </p><p></p><p>I pretend not to know of the depths of your ancient rifts and strife. I only know that my cause is just and I seek not to usurp, but to unify! Let no soul who would aid the causes of righteousness be turned away for ancient prejudice! Let us rally as one nation united across the realms to beat back the forces of Death and Darkness! Let the full spectrum of light, the infinite chroma, shine throughout all lands!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stands up slowly, looking down on the mage.  Not in anger now, but fear.  "Answer me this last question.  What is your surname?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I..."</p><p>"I know not."</p><p></p><p>Saying these words out loud trigger a desperate search in Maouelue's....Lumao's mind. His amnesia coming in fits and spurts...lost words...lost memories...he clings on to his old name in his mind, trying to piece it together....</p><p></p><p>...for naught.</p><p></p><p>The answer is not forthcoming....</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He now rises up, turns around and begins rummaging through his things, digging relentlessly for something.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Tucked deep within the pages of his torn diary, he finds what he is looking for. An old note. An undelivered message. Unread out of honor and duty, but now...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>It would seem the truth would finally have to be out, though he is reluctant to reveal these personal tidings to all, there really is nothing left for it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He proffers Shi'Vandos' mesage for Shi'Veilan to the Queen.</p><p></p><p>"These are the words of my Father, intended for his...other son. <i>Brightshine</i>... Of mine own name, I remain yet ignorant....uninformed...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It begins with Lumao...or at least that's what I can remember. Perhaps, Majesty, you might do me the honor of filling in the rest...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He genuflects again.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The soldier comes in with a book, and the Queen takes it from him, sets it on the table.  She puts a hand out in front of the kneeling man, says elven works.  A warmth spreads over the mage, quite the opposite feeling of her previous magics.  After a few moments, she lifts the mage up to standing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>To the room at large, she says, "Continue to prepare.  I will be back shortly." </p><p>Then she says to Maouelue, "Follow me.  There is something you need to know, friend of elves and dragons."  She is smiling now, quietly, softly.  She walks to a side room where a table and several bookshelves line the wall.  She's brought the book the soldier gave her, and she sits at the table, offering Maouelue the other lone chair.</p>

<p>"Your surname is Albrek.  Shi'Vandos was a high mage that came to the Feywild well after his family was banished, one of the high hopes of Oberon."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"These dragonmarks...  they are aberrations in the fabric of reality, Maouelue.  Some say they are a birthright, given at specific times after specific deeds are done.  Other say they spontaneously occur, being as brands on the skin.  I will ask you, although you can decline showing me...  Is this mark anywhere on your body currently?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Astonishingly, the mage realizes he cannot answer this question in full knowledge of the truth. Something about her way and line of questioning seems to drive right at the heart of his uncertainties, almost in a knowing, motherly sort of way.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If it would not offend the Queen..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He makes to disrobe.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us find out together."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She nods.</p>

<p>(Insight check, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He begins to doff his armor, laying the pieces out ritually as he does, akin to back in Oakhurst. As the metal peels away, he feels the warm sweaty undergarments articulated by the open air, chilling slightly. Piece after piece he bares himself fully to Titania.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he is taking his clothing off, just before he gets to the...  erm...  personal bits, he remembers something in speaking with his father.  Something of the trials.  Something about a birthright...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...<i>the circled key</i>...”</p><p></p><p>The words leave his mouth as if spoken by another, his form entranced in this astounding, yet serene, scene.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Queen pulls back a bit, visibly.  "So, you're aware of this?  It does not look like it's on you at this moment..."  She leaves the silence to speak the rest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...the ice in the mountain...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...the Frozen Tears...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...the Prince...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao Albrek rises and turns now to face his Queen, the last remnants of his coverings both outer and now inner have been removed. </p><p></p><p>“I stand before you in the naked truth of the ancient starlight. I have nothing left to hide, and though there is much to be feared, I put my faith in that light.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“My Queen, I Lumao Albrek do formally request that I may undertake the Trials of the Eldar, to prove my honor and claim my birthright!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks completely taken aback by the statement.  "You...  you know what that means, yes?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I must admit, much as everything in my life, I seem to know but only enough to be pushed unrelenting to my fate. My ears are open, as are my heart and soul. Whatever the risks, they are mine alone to bear. For now I listen.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at Maouelue, earnestly.  "This book has in it a dire warning of those marks.  I would hinder you not from going on your quest, taking the trials.  But Maouelue, please know what you are asking both of me and of this kingdom.  Anyone who bears that mark is not allowed in the Feywild upon punishment of death.  The great laws demand it so.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It goes back to the last statement of your ancestor, as they were banished from this land.  A destiny was put upon any with the mark.  They are to be the ruin of the eladrin. </p><p> They are to be the bringer of balefire down upon the planes.  They will be as a plague upon the free peoples of the world.  And they are to search out and find the core of the Dragon Prophecy and begin the calamity.  If you continue on your path, this <i>will be</i> your destiny.  I fear not only for your life, Wizard.  I fear for your soul."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The ancestor of Albrek does not move, does not make a sound. He stoops still, stoically staring into not the space in front of him. In and out of focus, time turns elastic. He feels a deep roar swelling from his core, like a supernova of emotion teeming to the brink, then finally eventing, piercing the precipice of pressure, the crest of the wave, the horn of the dragon sounding out its woe of tidings. The ferocious din gathering inside wells up through his voice and now the Dragon Mage rises up off the ground, raising his taut face to the sky, baring his chest upwards, then...</p><p></p><p>"rrrrrRRRrRrRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAAAaaAAAaAaAaAggGGHGG!!!!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>In a flash, all of the pent up emotion, the years of towing the line, treading the path cut before him with lies, deceit, and ulterior motive, lashes out in a zealous fury! As Bahamut spares not the life before him that is without redemption, so forth does this uproarious ebullition, woefully warbled by the weary and worn wizard, spare not the sanctity and serenity of this place. It bears no heed for the Queen's prophetic words. Pure release, that born of the same energies that push all causes forth, those that continue to push boundaries of polarity only to be resisted inevitably by the grand wheel, the great equal, the inevitable return. From here and always, the recapitulation is always nigh.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow.  Quick question - was that outburst an attack, by chance?  Or did it expel energy at all?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Not an attack, perhaps a slight wave of force would have burst from him though, sonically. I imagine a sort of dip in the actual soundfield as if the supernova in his soul temporarily created a vacuum as the "gravitational force" reversed. Like a big noise gate on the whole hall, but then bursting out, articulating the whole of the space around them.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(If this next part is not cohesive to what you want, let me know.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I'm not in control 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the roar issues forth from the mage, the centerpiece of a cosmic game of tug-of-war, a wild surge of magic issues forth.  Soldiers come in, Daran as well, and see chaos.  Maouelue is floating in the middle of the room, cloaked in a sphere of silvery, wispy light.  Queen Titania, and all of the other objects in the room, are tossed about, then are reatracted to the ceiling in a sudden reversal of gravity.  Everything lands with a <i>thump</i>, and even a couple soldiers, the first ones to the Queen's aid, go shooting  upwards.  Daran tries to yell out for Maouelue's attention...</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He dare not enter the room, but he yells from the doorway, keeping everyone out at same time.  "Maouelue!  What are you doing?!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A glowing eye turns to Daran, but there is little recognition there, this is something from deep within the mage that seems to have overridden his conscience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A mage from the other room tries to think quickly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>!spell dispell magic</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sec)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The spell pulses through the floating mage, dimming, but not extinguishing the burst of light. Lumao falls to the floor, slamming down hard, unconscious.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(1d24 to see how long you're out, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
@Russell  :game_die:
**Result**: 1d24 (**24**)
**Total**: 24

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(critical. lol. perfect)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Whoa.  This took a turn, eh?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(indeed! not planned, just kind of organically happened based on the circumstances.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Blackness overtakes Maouelue.  Dread dreams of darkness, where dragons dwell.  The snatches of images are brief, but what Maouelue will remember is the fear and uncertainty all around him.</p><p></p><p>He wakes in a comfortable bed, the setting sunlight streaming through the open windows.  It's a simple room, simple wooden bed.  The room is small and quaintly adorned.  Bellatrix sits next to the wizard, ringing out a cloth and is about to put it to his head when she notices he's awake.  She freezes, watching with wide eyes.  Waiting.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He blinks a few times, then raises his arm to shield the piercing sunlight. His vision begins to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"...Bella?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What...what happened?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She stammers, mouth opening and closing.  Then she closes her mouth and throws herself at Maouelue, hugging him and crying softly.  "Oh, Mao.  I'm so sorry.  You must have been so scared.  It's...  It's...  Oh Mao, it's all my fault."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He is slow to react at first, surprised at her thrown embrace, then he wraps his arms around her, holding her close. Closing his eyes again, he says, "How? How could this be <i>your</i> fault? What happened?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I let the darkness out.  It is my fault.  You...  you and the Queen, you went to a side room.  The others said she did some sort of reading and that you and she had severe words.  She was concerned about your heritage and whether you had designs on her kingdom.  Madness, all of it.  And all of it laid at my feet.  You both had recessed in the side room, and then an explosion happened.  We heard it from the second floor, across the castle.  Daran said he saw you hovering off the ground and that gravity reversed itself.  The Queen was unconscious and the room was in turmoil.   Naturally, Daran tried to help.  He said you would never, but some guards and soldiers carried Titania away, and the rest escorted us out of the castle.  </p><p></p><p>"We're at an inn at the outskirts of the city.  Just outside of the Eastern docks.  They said we can have passage away from Astrazalian.  They said we can travel in the other lands, but are long longer welcomed by the Court.  Oh, I'm so sorry, Maouelue."  She cowers again against the wizard's chest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The gravity of these words falls over the elf like an icy sheet. He shudders for a moment, but otherwise remains motionless, thinking. <i>Surely this can't have been all Bella's doing.</i> His zeal had gotten the better of him yet again, but it would not end here. No way. There were still too many questions left unanswered. <i>The Queen...</i> Once again, memory is a fit of haze. <i>What happened?!?</i> He would have to set this right. Soon. Now. There would be no future chance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There's a soft knock on the closed door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We leave for Mag Tureah tonight."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He pulls himself from Bella's embrace and goes to answer the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Otirnis, lord wizard.  Bearing a parting gift from the Queen and Court."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao opens the door, a tear frozen in the corner of his eye. "Otirnis, it is good of you to come. You are welcome here."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bows, hand to shoulder.  Then straightens and presents the book from the side room to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Queen sends her regrets that she is not able to deliver this in person.  She wishes you and your party well.   And she said to tell you, if you decide the opposite road of that which you have discussed before, she would be open to speaking again."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Am I to understand that she means either choosing the way of the dragon or the way of my people?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(By taking the trials and getting the dragonmark, you'll be fulfilling a prophecy that ends with the ending of the eladrin and the Feywild, according to her knowledge.  By renouncing the trials, or at least bypassing it for the time being, she would be willing to keep you and the crew on for the raid.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Otirnis," he places his hand on his heart. "I will speak with the Queen."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin nods, salutes again, and says, "Very well.  Follow me."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm actually going to pause it there tonight, brother.   I'm exhausted!!  I'll email you what I have for the backstory as of now.  I plan on adding a bit more here and there, but that'll make up for my peace-ing out early!  See you tomorrow for the jam!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Good stuff dude. Pretty wild day indeed. Never any rush. Jaammmmmmzzzz)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks back at Bella, “Let us ready ourselves for the journey ahead. We will meet again with the Queen.” He turns back to Otirnis, “If it please her majesty, I would have us <i>all</i> attend.” He glances meaningfully at Bella, then assembled his things and begins to don his armor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Otirnis adds, "I will wait by the front doors.  At your leisure, lord wizard."  Carrying her things already, Bellatrix helps Maouelue with his armor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>After a customary final sweep of the premises, the two leave through the front door to join their eldarin guard. “I am sorry to bring such trouble to your realm, Otirnis. Would that we could have met under different circumstances.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Otirnis gives Maouelue a long glance, not showing any inner thought or prejudice.  Just a review of the man she sees before her.  "You are special, Maouelue.  You and your group.  Far be it for me to hold your presence or circumstances against you.  In fact, the way I see it, if you hadn't appeared when you did, we might not have made it back to Aztrazalian at all.  There were too many to face for our group, between the fomorians and the goblin horde.  There is no need for sorrow or grief towards me or my unit, lord wizard.  We stand behind you.  And will continue to fight by your side, should you still find it fitting."  She hops on a horse tethered to the post outside the inn, offers the other four to the party and says, "Follow me, please."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She then heels her horse W towards the center of the island.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group moves quickly through the somewhat empty streets.  Giving a wide berth to the horse riders, the elves and eladrin gawk at the procession.  Through the town, through the crystal gates, then into the courtyard proper, everyone is relieved of their mounts and walked into the palace.  Maouelue notices there are several guards escorting them now, where as before it was quite a bit lighter coverage.  Bellatrix stands besides the wizard, offering her support in proximity.  Daran and the old woman take up  the rear, Benna now quiet with no hint at mirth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The escort brings them to the throne room where, as before, the three chairs are filled by their liege lords.  The Queen looks outwardly calm, but sits straighter in her chair as she sees the procession brought forward.  King Oberon looks concerned, while Queen Tiandra has a look of puzzlement on her face.  She says, "What are they doing back here, guards?  I thought the Court made it clear that they were no longer welcome here."</p><p></p><p>"Be at peace, sister.  The guards were instructed to bring them if there was a parlay to be had.  I assume that is why you are here again, goodsir Mage?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I must admit, I was surprised to be offered a second chance after my previous...outburst. I know not what overcame me, but i ask not for forgiveness, only the opportunity to repent. For this chance, I am most grateful. There is much confusion in my heart, but my mind is set firmly on aiding your cause and rescuing my friend. </p><p></p><p>These past days I have let my ego grow wild to the detriment of others. No longer shall this be the case. I take the knee once more.”</p><p></p><p>Lumao genuflects again, this time with no sense of grandeur.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The others follow suit, mimicking their leader.  </p><p>"Please, rise, sir Mage.  What is done is done, and what was said," she gives Maouelue a knowing stare, "was said.  Take to heart what you can accept, leave the rest as you will.  It is my understanding, since you are here, that you all still wish to still take part in ridding our lands of the scourge of the Queen of Air and Darkness's forces of evil?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It is thus, Majesty.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at all of the group in turn.  (Insight check, with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Getting back to <i>rollin'</i>!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She's holding something back, but what it is, you're not sure.  Maybe her next statement...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She seems to come to a decision.  "There has been a new development.  There is a need for a small, rogue group to infiltrate the my dark sister's lair itself."  The King and Queen turn to look at her, confused.  "The dark crystal that has tormented her thus would be the objective.  She carries it with her at all times.  And she is surrounded by guards and all other manner of unseelie fiends.  This is not something I ask lightly, obviously.  However, it would mean the end to whatever has a hold on her.  It would also go a long way to proving your worth to the Court.  If this does not sound amenable to you our your party, the raid is still an option."  She sits placidly while waiting for a response.  As for the other seelie in the room, every mouth is agape.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It shall be done.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
<p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 3 iterations, DC 20...</p><p>1d20 (14) + 2 = </p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (7) + 2 = </p><p>0 successes, 28 total.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna starts giggling under her breath again.  Daran sighs.  Bellatrix takes a sharp intake of breath.  But no one says anything.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Very well.  You will meet with Captain Jelentrianna in the armory in four hours time.  She will go over the objectives.  Bring me back the black crystal and my sister, both preferably unharmed.  Anything else is ancillary and up to your discretion.  If you wish, we can give you an out if you are caught and do not wish to be tortured.  The Captain will see to your needs and the plans.  Good luck and may the gods bless you all, warriors of Astrazalian."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao bows silently and follows to the armory.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage and company follow a guard escort to the armory, where the doors are opened and are ushered inside.  There is a side table with four chairs, and Daran immediately draws one out and sits.  When the guards leave the room to take their posts outside the door, the ranger says, "Whats the play here, Maouelue?  We really going to do this?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I go to do this thing. None that would turn aside need follow me. You have all taken on more have your fair share thus far. I go to free these lands once and for all, so that we may have the realm at our back when we go to the citadel. None will be able to deny me should I do this thing.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage moves through picking up the trinkets from his last venture here. He gazes at the two swords, then turns to the guards. “If it would please the Queen, I shall take Midsummer and Midwinter to fulfill this deed.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The guards turn and say, "Nay, we cannot allow you to take up those, they have to be given by the Queen herself.  If you would like, we can send an envoy to ask the Queen for you?"</p><p></p><p>Daran shakes his head, and gets up to lean in to whisper in Maouelue's ear.  "This is a suicide mission.  I am not sure what was said, what was done, there are insane rumors going around.  It doesn't matter, though.  All of us could go with you - the entire gods-damned army could attack, and it would still be the same.  This is madness, Maouelue.  The Queen could even deny you aid after you come back successful...  and that is a big if.  Are you sure this is the best course of action?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How can man or elf be sure of anything in this w- <i>these</i> worlds Daran? What <i>isn't</i> madness?</p><p></p><p>Here, for the first time in ages have I felt rest; it was but false. The <i>best course</i>, you say? No friend, it is not. But, it will keep us in the Queen's good graces and out of the realm's wroth for now. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is well. I have seen him through Lanrion. He is well attended, and I have no fear we shall meet again. Something here is a part of this and whilst we are here, it is our duty to attend to it.  </p><p></p><p>I do not ask any of you to follow me blindly into death. But I do ask you hinder me not."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks at Maouelue.  He lower's his head in thought.  Bellatrix comes over to give Maouelue her unspoken support.  </p><p>"I will not hinder you.  I will be behind you.  I brought you here, what happens to you all is partly my doing."  He lifts his head, saying, "Faen nha."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao takes up the guard’s offer to inquire after the swords, then goes back into his stoic posture.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix pats the wizards back.  Daran sits back in his chair.  Benna wanders through the armory quietly.  Time passes.  Eventually, Daran stands and starts going through his gear and adding armor and weaponry.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sorry for Maouleue’a epic mood swings lately!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, I think it makes a lot of sense.  He's in a strange place, where he thought one thing was going to happen. I threw a huge curve ball at you/him, and things happened as they did.  I hope you're not too pissed about coming out of left field with a new mission!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’m gonna zip through this part a bit though i think.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao secures the trinkets he had previously spied in the armory and sets about looking for a good eladrin longbow and quiver of arrows.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We can fast forward through the armaments.  Just put in what you want in your DND Beyond, and make sure to !update.)</p>

<p>Lumao offers around a few trinkets to the group, having reoutfitted himself. His Amulet of Health he offers to Bellatrix, the Mace of Reduction he passes to Daran.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A splint mail he proffers to any who would take it</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A ring of fire resistance he hands to Benna</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The time passes slowly, especially in the silence.  Soon, boots are heard outside the hall.  Jelentrianna and two more plate-garbed summer eladrin sway in.  She marches over to a main table in the room, sets out a few scroll cases, then turns to face the group.  "Please continue to arm yourselves.  When you all are ready, we'll go over the plans for the raid on the opposition's main keep."</p><p>(Daran's got some good armor, he picked up a couple things, too.  Bellatrix and Benna aren't proficient with that armor.  Or any, for that matter!  Witches!)</p>

<p>(Word! I'll keep the armor, they can take the trinkets/mace...or not!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran takes the mace, and clips it on his belt.  Maouelue sees two gleaming scimitars replace his others.  He also has a newer longbow with golden-fletched arrows.  He was eyeing a cloak as well.  Bellatrix and Benna both take the items, Bellatrix gives a small smile in return.</p>

<p>"Aye.  The Queen tells me you are to make a direct incursion on the Queen of Darkness's keep itself.  The goal is to relieve her of the black crystal and bring it, and her, back to Astrazalian.  This," she takes a deep breath, "is a difficult task.  Some may even say it is impossible.  Militarily, I would say it so with all of our army at the front door.  That being said, a small number would be best to infiltrate and take down the enemy from within.  Not to mention, regardless of whether you succeed or not, your names are already written into legend.  No one has even dared attempt what you four are about to.  Stories go, Queen Titania herself approached the front gates once.  She was able to spirit away after the ground was scorched where she had stood.  So...  know that you have the entire seelie people behind you.  What you do..."  She bows her head for a moment.  She then raises her eyes to Maouelue, who can see the emotion in them.  "We are very appreciative.  I'm good at being a solider.  But it would be good to just be an eladrin again.  Thank you, lord wizard."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles and nods.  "This...  would definitely cement that, I should say!"  She laughs, and her honor guard chuckle as well.   The tension felt only moments before seems to drift away, as steam on a cool breeze.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>"So, the best we can tell, the enemy keep is...  interred.  Like Mag Tureah, which is the fomorian stronghold, the Queen's keep is well underground in the Feydark.  Since we've never had people go into or come out of the place, we're planning blind here.  The only solid piece of information we have is that there are portals into the keep from a few specific areas around the Feywild.  First, there is said to be a portal at the center of the Maze of Fathaghn.  The dryad Fathaghn is said to have gone into the ground, that she hasn't been seen for some time.  More than likely, no one's been stupid enough to go looking for her.  The second place is the tallest spire in the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  You would have to face the Pale Prince along with extreme cold to best this test.  Lastly, Shinaelestra, or the Fading City, was once to be the Queen of Air and Darkness's birthright.  As a former Spring Eladrin, she was to rule there and bring a new era of peace and prosperity.  It is now a desolate, abandoned ruin.  With it being so close to both the Wild North and Vor Thomil, who knows what has run of the place now.  I can say, with a fair bit of certainty, that the keep can be found through the portals at any of these locations."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"We'd like to provide ground support, but the best I can give you right now, with the other raid happening, is a squadron of five long-range bowmen.  Depending on where you go, they could give you ground cover in the case of something large right away.   Where would your group like to go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We go to the Fortress of Frozen Tears."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks around with an icy stare that almost begs someone to challenge this assertion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They all look strangely at the stare from Maouelue.  The Captain breaks the awkward silence.  "Ah...  very well, lord wizard.  You should look through our cold-weather gear, then.  Right this way."  She leads the group to a small alcove with cabinetry with eladrin made cold clothing.  As you all start parsing through, Daran leans in closer to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bellatrix and I should be fine, but...  what if I sent Benna back home, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Do as you see fit brother."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods, hesitantly.  Then goes over to whisper with Benna.</p>

<p>Benna laughs at him and goes back to clothes shopping.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When the team is set, their packs readied, Captain Jelentrianna ushers Maouelue back to the scrolls.  She unfurls one, giving him the coordinates for the Fortress.  The next she unfurls, it has a general layout of the tower.  Lastly, the third has a writ of passage from the Queen, so transportation should not be an issue.  After all is packaged back up, the eladrin and her honor guard salute Maouelue's team, bowing at the waist.  "Go with courage and honor, lord wizard.  We look forward to seeing you all back when the job is finished."  With that, she turns on her heels and marches out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(work and stuff happened)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, brother!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I look forward to this meeting as well. We will see you on the other side of the battle."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>With that, the troupe picks up and begins to head out to their destiny, for better or worse.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The guards throughout the palace are at attention, saluting the team as the they exit the crystalline Castle of Starlight.  As the constant autumnal sun shines on the courtyard, a garrison of troops are waiting in salute there as well.  Four horses are waiting to take the group to the Eastern Docks.  Once there, they board a small ship that will take them down a tributary and into the Vale of Long Night.  From there, as the ship deposits the team in the freezing cold, the group looks over the barren wasteland of snow and ice.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Distance, like time in the Feywild, is amorphous.  Malleable.  From the map, looks like the destination is over a mountain range.  Maouelue sees a range to the north and one to the south.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage surveys the frozen lands, the iciness fields matching that of his heart. There is comfort in this, frost, the one thing he could always count on. He surveys the lands looking for a low point in the ranges ahead of their destination in readiness to push off.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's going to be some mechanics here for the trudge and travel.  I've got dinner for the kids, though, so I'll be afk but we can get this ramped up asap!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cool cool!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Travel through snow, ice, blizzards, avalanches, and over mountainous terrain is all really rough.  Going with a smaller group is good, but it's still treacherous.  Plus, there are a ton of animals the group has never seen before.  You all have a bunch of items that are useful, but the biggest thing through here is going to be the survival trait.  Bellatrix and Benna are no good here, but Daran is an expert.  You can choose whether to aid him - to have him roll advantage - or the two of you take singular rolls.  Sometimes it'll be a group survival or stealth or perception check.  Other times, it'll be the leader/s.  First, give me a d20 roll.  1=d100+25; 2-5=d100+20; 6-10=d75+15; 11-15=d50+10; 16-19=d25+5; 20=d20)</p>

<p>Daran is worried, preoccupied by making sure the group members are okay.  Bellatrix sees them first, and tugs at Maouelue's arm.  There are huge, black creatures wandering over the snowy plain, near the mountain pass.  She tells the wizard that they are enormous, it's not just a perspective.  They are gaunt, maybe around 30 feet tall.  Wisps of black smoke are whipping off of the creatures.</p>

<p>Benna sits shivering in the snow-packed trail.  The rest spy a cave a little further on.  Daran, sizing up the group's situation, says to Maouelue, "Might be best to take a breather.  There's a cave up ahead there.  You and I can check it out, maybe make camp there for a longer rest?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks over at the sisters, who are looking rough and bitterly cold. </p><p></p><p>“To the cave!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But for the sake of the gods, keep a lookout for anything that moves!”</p>

<p>Daran covers Maouelue's flank, the women huddle against the mount wall, trying to escape the bitter wind.  Maouelue does not see anything at this point, the cave looks to be deep, more than 20ft deep at least.  There are no animals visible. </p><p></p><p>As the pair continue to make their way to the mouth of the cave, nothing else presents itself, but the inside is more visible now.   Darkness shadows the back of the hole in the mountain.  The ceilings are covered in sharp icicles, which start ten feet overhead.  The snow goes in a few feet, but the eddies of wind keep the rest of the cave snow free.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a good look, and with Maouelue's dark vision, he can see pretty far into the cave.  It goes on a distance, the space opening up well past the limit of his vision.  Bones litter the floor.  Small bones, none look to be bigger than a human hand bone.  At least of what he can see.  (What would you like to do?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do we happen to have a map for this greater area on R20?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, but I could get one up!  I hear you, but no worries sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao asks the group to stand back by the entrance for a moment. He raises his hands toward the icicles hanging from the ceiling. He speaks a word of warmth...</p><p></p><p>"Let the fires of our hearts heat the hearth in this humble home."</p><p></p><p>As he says this, a blast of flames flows outward toward the ceiling, melting the ice into falling drops of water. Then, as the water falls and pools, he speaks a word of shaping and cooling, sending two large planes of water to either side of the group. He holds the makeshift walls of water in place, then concentrates on freezing them in place, leaving just enough of a gap at the top of each for airflow.</p><p></p><p>With this complete, he magically sops up the remainder of the water from the ground and patches up the edges, securing them in place. He then invites the group to circle round and huddle in.</p>

(Just an fyi, I'm working with these rules for a 'focused attack' like this.  Basically, the base attack has to be +6 or better, and you would have to give up both attacks to get a benefit to your critical hit range.  So, basically, I'll crit 16-20.  If I crit, and if I put him under 0 points, I'll get to 'call my shot'.  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/3rd-party-feats/rogue-genius-games/combat-feats/focused-attack-combat/)

<p>(ok and you said at disadvantage? Just for attack rolls or anything else?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I'm going to have them all ready their actions until they see what's coming? Like Bella and Mao will hold spells at the ready and Daran can hold an attack or whatever he wants. Essentially, I want Mao out ahead holding Burning Hands, and I want Bella holding scorching Ray. If I can do that as the surprise round then be in normal init, then cool, otherwise I'll maybe send a few cursory blasts into the dark.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'll say if Mao goes forward with burning hands, he's going to see what's coming at him and the surprise round ends.  Daran was going to wing a shot in the dark to see if he can hit something.)</p>

<p>The carnage culminates with the last wall falling outwards toward the cave mouth opening, with a large <i>crash</i>.  Daran starts slicing up some of the yetis and flying beasts.  (Nature check for what they are and for any salvageable bits.  Perception or investigation if you want to check out the cave more.)</p>

<p>The group gathers to look through the cave properly.  Maouelue, being very curious, finds that the cave rounds at the middle, where the bulk of the fighting took place, and tapers at the entrance and farther in.  There is a crevice at the very end of the cave, cracked through the rock.  It is...</p>

<p>(For elves, at least!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok need to do a general time of day/weather status update. We may take to the cave fully and am wondering about maybe piling up some snow boulders in front of the entrance to obfuscate it. Also, directionally, if we were to head straight through the back of the cave, is that the direction of the fortress?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's the Feywild, so it's always that middle-to-end of the day, sunset, etc.  Never changes.  There is a little light coming in from the mouth of the cave, but it doesn't reach as far as the back of the cave.  It's considered in darkness for mechanics.  There is a bunch of snow outside.  If you all take a few hours to gather it, you could pile up enough to semi-close the gap.  We could do group or aided survival checks for both the direction of the cave and the success of finding a way through, if it even goes through to the other side, etc.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool cool. gonna be in and out here now for awhile.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Coo.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think we want to camp out here for a while and get our bearings in the relative safety. Perhaps we cool up some yeti meat to get proper fed before moving on. Mao will switch to the bat and they will all do a short rest/eat. They’ll spend some time stacking up the “door/barricade” and Daran will scout the outside of the cave a bit to see what else is around and what direction he can tell from outside. Mao will be using the bat to inspect in the outcropping a bit and checking for hidden passages, knocking on the walls to hear echoes etc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group sets to work on the yetis and their flying companions.  After a time, and after setting up a nice big fire, they're able to set a few pelts together, curing in the heat.  Plus, several steaks are on a spit, fat dripping and sizzling on the cookfire.</p><p></p><p>Daran sets out to check the walls, then the outside, then scouts up ahead for other animals and the general lay of the land.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He gets a pretty good sense on the direction.  If they were to continue in the direction of the gash, they would be going toward the Fortress.  Generally, and that's if the cavern moves straight.  Once down there, it would be hard to tell the direction.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hawk-turned-bat squeeks then hops/flies down the small shaft.  Almost 80 ft further in, the crack opens up into a fairly large cavern.  The bat can only see midway through, mostly inky blackness and stalactites greet him.  However, he is able to glimpse, just as he gets to the edge of the telepathic connection, a floor several dozen feet below, with scattered pools of water around.  He detected no movement or life in the pass or the cavern.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"This would be the time to have a Druid around...", Maouelue says, reminiscing about the <i>many</i> times Dieter would transform randomly into a spider or aught else and bugger off into a cavern. He allows himself a small chuckle that, surprisingly, offers a glimpse of an inner heat that more than matches that of the fire. The investigator notes this curiously and files it away as he considers how best to approach the situation without a shapeshifter in company.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Armor and tight spaces aren't made for each other.  Thirty feet in, there is an odd outcropping, and with Maouelue's bulk, he just isn't able to squeeze past it.  His bat can see a bit more of the area - and it shows more of the same.  Bigger cavern, stalactites and stalagmites.  Smaller pools here and there formed from water dripping down from above.  Nothing moving or shaking.  The pass is at least structurally sound, there doesn't seem to be any rock debris falling, or scree anywhere.</p>

<p>When the group looks around the cavern, they hear water dripping, can actually hear water moving somewhere in the distance.  The light doesn't shine into the edges, but as the four carefully traverse the ground, they can map out an irregular circular, nearly spherical, cave.  Almost directly opposite from the cracked pass, there is another crevasse, this one is big enough to fit two people side-by-side.  It is also hewn from the rock by water; a small stream meanders through the middle of this passage, downward, farther into the solid rock.  Just in front of this cavern, Maouelue sees something glinting in the gem-light.  A couple things, actually.</p>

<p>Everyone's head is on a swivel as the progress into the passage.  Daran is in the rear, checking for flankers.  And mudrats.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The metal mage finds that, the further he goes into the tunnel, the hotter it is getting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Soon, there is a branch that backtracks and adds another stream going downward.  There are sections that have a few feet drops, there are areas that meander, seemingly cutting back.  The whole time, though, the group has been walking with the stream, always downhill.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, the passage opens up wider to a 20x20 tunnel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hundred feet further down the path, the crew hears sound of rushing water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Some caves these!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Fammy flies ahead to check it out.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The end of the tunnel looks out over an irregularly shaped cavern, this time with a much larger drop.  Several openings throughout the area have water pouring into a massive pool on the bottom of the cave.  Fammy senses a few things in the water, but can't make out what they are.  Plus, there is steam rising up from the water below.  Which is different, because the water you've been travelling with has been cold.  Stalactites and stalagmites abound in the system, and just before the telepathy gives out, Fammy can see the cave actually dog-legs into a completely new section further on.  It could go on for quite a bit further in that direction, and the rushing water seems to get louder in that direction, too.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gonna hit pause there tonight, sir.  Fun stuff!  Hope you like the easter eggs!  Might have an ask for you for the Monday sesh, but I'll email you, just in case.  Have a good one, brother!)</p>

<p>Maouleue looks at the group, offering his hand and focusing on Bella.</p><p></p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at Maouelue.  "What, do you have a magic carpet?"</p><p>(Roll20 is up!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes her hand and shouts to the others, “Jump!!!”, then leaping off and pulling Bella with him!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You all are 75 feet up from the water.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna cackles all the way down, Bellatrix is laughing, completely trusting and at ease with Maouelue's leadership.  Daran... is along for the ride.  A small <i>splash</i> happens as the four enter the water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(How deep and how warm where we are standing?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue begins to manipulate the water, pushing and pulling it up and around, dissing out the depth and assessing the footing underneath. He begins to make a large icy path over to the closest “island” rock in the center, aiming to connect as many as he can to traverse the area.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(or maybe better yet, we make an ice boat)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ice boat would work!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Each member of the quartet try and reach the bottom, but cannot and have to tread water.  Daran takes a chance and tries to swim down, but he stops fairly quickly as the heat gets uncomfortable almost right away.</p>

<p>There are small fish in the water, here and there.  Nothing dangerous, though.  There are also a couple spaces to the east and north where the water is being churned up.  It doesn't look the fish are the reason being the tumult.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The fey bat flies directly overhead the churning spots in the water, trying to make out shapes below, floating across in multiple passes at varying heights.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Can't have an ice boat without ice oars!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Fammy senses something coming to the surface, or trying to, but can't see anything specific.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Fammy also sees four different sections that branch off from the main section.  The dog-leg to the right has some small rapids.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to cast find familiar again to change the form of Fammy. Might have to ritual it and burn some stuff? Can I get a ruling?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>“Keep an eye out while I take care of something here.” Maouelue takes to his ritual preparation changing Fammy into a large toad that plops down into the water as soon as this is complete.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Assuming that goes smoothly, the toad will swim around and look directly at the forms under water.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(Meanwhile... 😀)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the ice boat floats to the next nearest opening, N, the group sees that stirring of water get bigger and bigger, almost becoming a whirlpool right in front of them.  Just as the churning waves turn the route in front of the pack into very choppy rapids, a being rears out from the depths!</p>

<p>!monimage water elemental</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Towering almost to the top of the cavern, dozens of feet in the air, an elemental made of water towers above the party.  (Initiative?  Or did someone want to parlay?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Now here is a beautiful being! Oho there! I am one with the water and integrated with the ice, I call on comets and merge with mist! I am the one who speaks with ice in his veins, who moves like water, who sings like steam! Come speak to me of the magic of this place, great spirit of water!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sisters are in awe.  Daran, ever stoic, raised just one eyebrow.  But the creature only has eyes (?) for the wizard.  (Persuasion check, please, with advantage!)</p>

<p>The ice boat is rotating fast.  As it's sucked towards the rapids and a decently steep first drop, the boat is either going to go down sideways, or right itself to going forward or backwards.  (The line-up is Maouelue, Bellatrix, Benna, and Daran, from front to back?)</p>

<p>Rushing water sprays up as the first rapid is met.  All of the sudden, the speed picks up as if the boat is pushed by a giant hand.  The drop is precipitous, and rocks jut out at all angles.  The light-orb hovers just in front of Maouelue, giving him a spine-chilling view of the tunnel they're about to traverse.  It is ever descending.  Untold numbers of rock spikes poke out from the walls and the water itself, almost as if the tunnel has teeth.  Benna starts giggling.</p>

Wonder where it's coming from?"</p><p></p><p>Benna is shifting through her vests and comes out with three small spines.  "Here," she says to the others.  "Eat this," and she passes out a spine to each of the group.  (Do you partake?)</p>

<p>Rushing water continues to bring the four companions through the insides of the mountain.  They look all around, and it hits them suddenly and at the same time - there is no sound.  It continues eerily like this for a few minutes until, very faintly, the elves start to hear a small sound.  At this point it is just white noise.  The boat continues on.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This is awesome...  😃)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sound is still hazy, but it sounds like rushing water.  Only this is much larger, a lot of water...  And, simultaneously, Maouelue feels the pace quicken, and begin to move downhill.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Up ahead, at the edge of his view, there is a dropoff - all he can see is the top of the tunnel angle down.  Just off to the left, right before the drop, is a small alcove.  If he's deft enough, he could nose the boat in and stop the momentum.  Or, they could go right for the fall.  What does Maouelue want to do?</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bottoms up!”, He charges the boat right for the falls.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I imagine this next part as a cut scene; a mix of insane roller-coaster meets water-park ride, all in the semi-dark!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran's face tightens and the sisters hold hands as Maouelue steers the ice boat into the course where he hears rushing water.  The tunnel does in fact fall away, into a 45 degree drop, and the water, already quick, picks up a fever pace.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Centuries of water making it's way though these tunnels has carved out an interesting tunnel.  Although straight in certain areas, where it does turn, it is often violent and jarring to the boat riders.  The first few are gentle enough, if surprising in the dark.  The next few, however, make it hard for Maouelue to keep the boat straight.  It knocks into the edges and threatens to tip!  (Dex save!)</p>

<p>The boat lists right, then left.  A massive drop and turn to the right, spiraling down, catches the sisters off guard.  Daran secures Benna, Maouelue and Bellatrix hunker down for the swirling fall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tunnel spirals for another hundred feet down, then levels off again, but the pace is still intense.  Their ball of light is trying to keep up with them, to illuminate the group's way.  But it might not be needed much longer.   At the end of this very long tunnel is now an opening.  The outline of which looks lit with red flame.  There are no off-shoots, no branches.  A few rock spires stick out treacherously.  The sound of the rushing water is all-encompassing now.  The group can see the twenty foot wide exit to whatever waits below only a hundred feet in front of them...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rushing water careens the boat towards the opening...  (Anything you want to do before you go over the edge?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(just white knuckling it all the way down and in.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Whoo!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the boat crests the edge, Maouelue gets a view of a massive cavern, strewn with rock crevasses, lava flows, and a huge waterway interconnecting everything.  A variety of beasts can be heard growling throughout, and, just as he's about to plummet over the lip, he sees an <i>enormous</i> being in the center, carrying a greatclub over a shoulder.  Then, they plummet...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ice boat descends into the cavern, a multitude of other waterfalls mix and add to the chaos.  Judging the distance down at near 200 feet, Maouelue and his crew brace for impact into the fluid below.  Fluid, not water.  He sees, as it comes up quickly, that it's a brownish, greenish soup.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's difficult to breathe now as the air in this portion of the mountain is steeped in lava ash and soot.  The boat melts on the way down.  The four are plunged into the depths of the fluid and find that they cannot see right in front of them.  It's a struggle to get back to the surface as the liquid is very thick, viscous.  (Dex saves, please!)</p>

<p>Maouelue breaks the water, followed closely by Bellatrix and Benna.  Immediately, they're all caught in a current that pulls them farther down.  Daran is able to land clear of the current, and he breaks the surface... without the others.  He tries to check on the others, but he can't see more than a couple inches in front of him.</p>

There is an eerie purple and yellow glow coming from the tunnel.  As the group moves closer, they can see it is coming from a bulbous mushroom standing just over three feet tall, and almost five feet wide from the cap.  There are a few yellow fungi in the S side of the room, emitting a fainter glow.  Every now and again, the yellow mushrooms tuck down close to the ground then <i>puff</i> up, releasing spores into the air.</p>

<p>They look but come up confused.  "These...  are not known to us.  They must be only found in the Feywild.  Did you want us to investigate them further?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Yes, let's do. I will inspect it for magical properties."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sets about exploring the mushroom in more detail, trying to sense what magic might be emanating from it. He takes a few  spore samples as he does and stows them for later investigation as well.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>For the purple one...</i>  (Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue can't really tell what it is, or what it does, but he gets a sense that it might be hostile if he tries to harm it in any way.  (Con save to get near the yellow ones, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard can get closer enough to a group of yellow fungi without harmful effects of the airborne spores.  That being said, they're still pretty strange looking.  Maouelue doesn't get the sense that they're magical, though.  They might have some interesting properties, but further examination would need to be done.  (An alchemist would have proficiency on investigation checks for this, fyi.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue gets closer into the area, he sees that getting past these mushrooms without touching them might be a tricky business.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"On second thought...let me take a slightly different vantage on these...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves back and directs his familiar to harvest some of the species and return them to a  piece of parchment he lays out for the purpose.</p>

<p>The wizard familiar is able to get a good quantity of yellow mushroom.  And, for good measure, was able to take a chunk out of the purple one, too.  Just as it flew in and out for the last time, a spore cloud caught it and he flew straight through.  (Con save, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
He's alright, just flustered a bit.  Now that the bits are set aside, Benna pulls out some equipment from her vest pockets and studies the mushrooms.  The yellow one is: Dwarven Fart. This mushroom is the size of a fist and packed full of spores. Crushing it or throwing it will cause it to release a cloud of spores in an area the size of a 5ft radius sphere. Each creature inside must pass a DC 15 check or be poisoned by an hour.  The purple one is: Gripa. Sometimes known as the sign of tragedy, or the plant of deaths. Rumor has it gripa grows where tragedies have taken place, as a memory of the fallen and their miseries. This purple vine grows as a product of the decomposition of a humanoid. It is often used by hags, which makes them really prone to build settlements around areas rich in gripa. It is rare to find, and with a large enough amount, it can be used as a daily treatment to reduce aging and it’s symptoms. It can also be used for purple coloring.

<p>“Ok, well...now I’ve got these mushrooms...  Now...Where the <i>hell</i> are we?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just past the mushroom cavern, the group sees carved stone walls with a hall moving off to the left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“In for another shroom, in for another room I always say... Let’s head on!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They move to the hall....on the left.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the quartet moves through the mushroom minefield, they enter the carved room structure, looking as if it were either constructed by someone or something, or possibly transposed into this mountain somehow.  The hall, beautifully carved stone throughout, carries on for about 25 feet then opens into another small room.  Halfway down the hall is another offshoot to the right (leading W).</p><p>(Roll20 is updated, btw.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group makes it's way farther down the passages, farther seemingly <i>into</i> a complex of sorts.  The walls are contoured and sculpted, with patterns and pictures scattered throughout.  As the foursome enter into the passage, a rancid stench greets their nose.  Another long hallway opens in front of them, with a passage and broad stairs on their right (N), another broad passage to the left (S), and a crumbling wall revealing a purplish glow in front of them, 35 feet away (W).</p><p></p><p>Atop the stairs to the North, a small creature is floating above the stone floor...</p>

<p>Worried more about the expanding gas than the creature, the group doesn't get a great read on it's intentions.  However, it doesn't seem aggressive at the moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's steer clear of that one for the moment," the Metal Mage offers, "We'll scout around a bit first. Could this be the underbelly of the Fortress? That would be astonishing...yet somewhat intentional. Ah the whims of the Source are hard to fathom at time. I remember how Shi'Vandos used to go on at length about the mysterious weave of time and energy that constitute the Planes we inhabit. He would speak to me of deep, untraceable connections between different times and spaces. Ah, how I wonder what he might say could he be here right now." </p><p>The mage's musing turn to soliloquy as the power of this place mingles with his memories.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's all coming together... 😀)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue leads his companions past the curious flumph and into the Western corridor.  The hall would normally have ended in a solid stone wall, however there is now a decent sized hole in the Northern wall through which the party sees more purple and yellow mushrooms.  Their glow gives the room an eerie, almost ominous presence.  As Maouelue looks into the room, to the South a hard scraping and low growl can be heard.  And felt, as the bass resonance shakes the walls and floors, rattling their bones.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A word whispered in Sylvan sends Maouelue's familiar ahead to scout the birds eye view of the disturbance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bird takes it's time flying to a few different areas.  First, the bird tracks North, through the purple mushroom area into another wide stone room, looking like an entrance room.  Farther north it views a large space with four wide columns holding up the weight of the mountain.   A room juts to the East from here, bringing the bird back, first, to the pool the group was dropped in then back to the purple mushroom room.  Heading back to the 'Entrance Hall', the bird then takes a small passage west, which expands to a hallway to the S.  Two doors on the E walls and a door at the end of the southward hall bar the birds path further.  </p><p></p><p>The bird returns to the group, then flits south, into another small entrance way, and then into a molten furnace of a lava flow.  A few beings splash around in the flow, but the bird is able to stay well above the heat and find a separate, return passage back to the party.  (Roll20 is updated, too!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Damn!!)  </p><p>The coast looks pretty clear.  Nothing moving, no sounds save for the dripping of water to the W and the rush of those drainage tunnels to the E.  There is a fallen door on the S side of the room, but it was knocked down ages ago, most of it is splinters now.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Was there anything in particular you wanted to check on or investigate?  We'll use the same roll.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(looking for any markings or symbols on the walls or in the construction)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a lot of rubble around, but of the stone you can see, there are what look like draconic runes etched in random places on the walls, ceiling, and floor.  Nothing that is cohesive or makes sense to any of you, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a few moments to make some rubbings of the runes in his book before leading the party on down the hall. (Toward the second smaller circle)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a 30ft by 30ft more draconic etchings line the wall, most are prominent near and on the massive bronze door leading W.  There is also a large bronze door going S.  Both look locked and, again, <i>massive</i>.</p>

<p>"Can anyone read any of this? It all appears to be magically sealed."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix and Benna come forward, inspecting the doors.  Daran looks on from afar but mainly walks around the room, every once in a while he will reach out and trace a draconic mark.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran makes his way over after a few minutes, the women whispering back and forth to each other.  </p><p></p><p>"Maouelue, a word?  I've been looking at these marks on the walls.  They continue through the caverns here, and are heaviest on the western door.  Now, I'm not a scholar... but these don't look like letters.  They're too random.  They look like...  scratches.  As if...  Well, it's almost as if some creature, maybe even a dragon, was housed here and forced through that doorway."  He points W.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A cold shiver runs down the mage's spine, chilling even beyond his inner frost. "A Dragon? Here?" Maouelue considers a moment, apparently lost deep in thought. "My friends, I must meditate on this. Let us set our camp here for awhile and secure our position.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As the team sets up the perimeter, Maouelue takes his helm in hand and assumes a lotus pose, his hands channeling through the Frostbitten Helm. He reaches out to his patron, searching for the spirit of the dragon.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue reaches out with his arcana, his sense is able to pass around the area, even showing him an alternative route around the S door.  When he attempts to search past the W door, however, he is gently rebuffed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The wizard gets up abruptly and moves back down the East corridor to inspect the broken door pieces in the next room. He tries to make out how it had been mounted and how it might have fallen.</p>

A scene plays out in the mages mind: *Elves are throwing ropes over something extremely large, trying to have them reach to their brethren flanking the beast.  There are dozens of elves moving around it, several get flung aside as a massive clawed paw comes slashing through Maouelue's view.  Suddenly, huge wings, blacker than pitch and wreathed in smoke, elongate and stretch over it's massed enemies.  With a roar that nearly splits the mages head in twain, the shadow beast tries to throw off it's paltry bonds.  As it in slow motion, a noosed rope is thrown perfectly into the air, nearly bouncing off the room's ceiling.  It effortlessly, amazingly slips over the dragon's neck, and Aefir Nightseeker gallantly strides up the beaat's tail to it's back, tightening the noose with a handsome smile on his face.  In seconds, the dragon is trussed and with a massive effort, it is pulled through heavy bronze doors.  As they're shut, a blue-pink glow wreaths the closed doors for a moment, then silence remains.*

Maoeuelue wakes bathed in sweat.

<p>(Getting some crossover here!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aefir Nightseeker was instantly recognizable to Maouelue.  He is a myth, a legendary elven figure.  He was said to be the right hand of Corellon Larethian, progenitor of the entire elven race.   He was golden in hue, from head to toe, and was said to be the father of the Summer Eladrin, where they got their coloring from.  Hundreds of thousands of stories are told of his conquests and vanquishing of foes.  A couple of the most famous are his Five Trials, also known as the Trials of Aefir, where he searched and found the 'Eye of Darkness'.  Another that immediately comes to Maouelue is the story of the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil.  It is said Aefir conquered it single-handedly and locked it away underneath a mountain.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Mhaor’isel Ghaatiil... Could it really be?</i></p><p></p><p>A thrill of apprehension and starlight seem to both invigorate and rivet the mage on the spot. What could have led him here at this moment? The strings of lore  tug at the very sinews of Maouelue’s body as he moves back to the group. </p><p></p><p>“We must tread carefully here. While my heart yearns to see and connect to the draconian mysteries here, my head pushes, may, pulls me away. Let us go around here to the South, through the mushroom Room. The Mush Room. The Shh Room. Let us be very very quiet...”</p><p></p><p><i>The mage’s voice reverberates to a halt among the silent cohort.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna and Bellatrix look relieved, they weren't able to get very far with the door's magic.  Daran look pensive.  All gather their things and follow Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the group travels back to the entrance hall, they can see the other door they were opposite of to the N of them.  Over time, the mushrooms toxicity must have eaten away the stone enough to allow for passages through this underground edifice.  The remaining hallway curves around to the S, and the group take the passage until they come to a choice.  Three doors are before them.  One right in front of the group, on the E wall, another one farther S on the same wall, then the hall ends in another door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They take a listen at the near door and Maouelue tests its lock.</p>

<p>(Wow!)</p><p>There is a fell wind blowing in the other side of the door, but very quietly.  Maouelue's elven ears pick it up, but it probably would have been overlooked by another's ear.  The lock is ancient and arcane in nature.  There is no keyhole, just a bronze knob jutting out.</p><p>(Arcanca  check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She gives Maouelue a wry, flirty smile.  Then she raises her hands and closes her eyes.   Bowing her head, she recites some words in a strange dialect.  Blue sparks erupt from her rotating hands.  They mix and spark against the pink glow.  As the two colors grow brighter, they have their own battle against the door.  A sharp crackle, sizzle, then a pop of light sends both colors fading away.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue thinks back to the last few...  have there been days here?  When they first transported here, Daran had an item he held onto.   He kept it in his bag.  Maouelue's pretty sure he saw Daran reaching into his bag before he disappeared.  Also, Maouelue's pretty sure there was no way to come back from that injury.  Daran, wherever he might be, is either dying or dead.  (He was at 0 hp.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A cold fury runs through Maouleue. </p><p>“It is time. Get ready.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The panther assumes a position so as to run down the hall and pounce on the beast as it reappears. Maouleue cycles his concentration for maximum damage. Bella and Benna ready their respective beams.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A bead of sweat runs down Bellatrix's brow.  Benna's eerily quiet.  That strange bass shaking rumbles softly through the floor.</p>

<p>Where the beast should have appeared...  nothing materializes.  Benna chuckles, once.  Bellatrix closes her eyes and lowers her hands.  A soft sob escapes her.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a <i>pop</i> makes the quartet jump, even scaring the panther.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In the middle of the room is the end of the monster's tail bone, dripping with venom.</p>

<p><i>Telepathically, to all</i> "This is my end of the bargain."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Apprehensive glances are cast all around. </p><p>“<i>Right!</i> Let us make haste!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Where to now?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You? You tell <i>us!</i>”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “We can’t leave Daran! Where is he?!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Bella...I’m afraid Daran walks a path that none of us can follow now.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Benna: "Honestly, these spells are so old, I don't know what they do anymore.  I guess that's what he wanted, to be sent away?  Glad it worked out, in the end.  Just wish I would have thought of it before Daran..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “Noooooooooooooo!!!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes her in his albeit cold hard arms.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna will comfort her as well, rubbing her back.  </p><p>"There's no body.  That could actually be a good thing."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We may yet see Daran again...someday.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: *Sniffle* “Oh...okay...”
*Please! Let him live!*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Was that last for me?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue harries the group south down the corridor.</p>

<p>The first is a potion of gaseous form, enough for two people.  The other is a superior potion of healing.</p><p>The 'coin' on the wall depicts a fire giant, head wreathed in flames like Roman laurels.  The trio knows very well that giants are world renown for their rune mastery, some of which can be seen on the rim of the golden circle.  (Anyone speak Giant?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Mao speaks Giant)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p><i>The panther is now standing on hindquarters, raising both fists in tacet approval.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage looks closer at the runes, and there seems to be another, thinner line of script written around a symbol of two dragons chasing one-another's tail.  The dragon symbol is in red against the gold background, and the ring around the symbol states, <i>Those with the dragon mark, a red dragon lineage, or fire giant heritage, place your hand upon the seal and open the gate.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Uncertain, Maouelue hesitantly extends his hand, palm outward to the seal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmph, worth a shot." He casts a glance around. "Any of you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Assuming there are empty gazes,) Maouelue takes a moment to do another rubbing taking the contours this seal down into his book. He looks one more time around the device for any other signs of concealment before leading the group down to the doorway at the end of the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The women shake their heads as they gather up some of the treasures.</p><p>Upon exiting, the three notice a rotten stench coming from the end of the hallway, not altogether different than the flumph gave off.  A sickly yellow-green mist comes up from the bottom of the door., which stands a bit ajar already.</p>

<p>Maouelue sends a blast of hot fire searing toward the doorway, standing at the edge of range.</p>

<p>Maouelue and Bellatrix take 9 points of damage, Benna takes the full 19 as the flames incinerate the simple door and back-drafts straight to them.  As soon as the rush of fire passes, they hear a low laughter coming from inside the now very smokey room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: "By the GODS Mao? What are you DOING?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agh Benna! I suppose....I should have asked you all to stand back. Something about the deep places brings out my quixotic impetuousness."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You in there!," Maouelue's voice cracks a bit as he attempts a challenging tone, "Show yourself!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is shuffling from the room, as smoke continues to billow out.  The laughing turns to gruff growling and a metallic scraping can be heard just under the growling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A big booming rumble of a voice breaks the eerie silence, saying, "WHO'S THERE?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sets his metallicomets spinning around him, like a fiercely charged atom, hoping stir the air and clarify the fog a bit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It is I, Lumao Albrek. I come solely in the pursuit of justice and peace."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Bellatrix whispers, "Mao... are you <i>sure</i> about this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"DON'T KNOW NO...  MAYO.  GO AWAY."  The voice, although booming, sounds a bit forlorn.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue steps forward into the smoke, comets a-swirling. "Though it may not seem it, we do not come to threaten. Tell us, who are you? What is your station here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I AM SNARR THE ONE-HANDED.  I HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED HERE FOR MANY YEARS.  THE WIZARD, HE TOOK MY HAND SO HE COULD TRAVEL, THEN LOCKED ME AWAY HERE FOR ETERNITY... JUST IN CASE HE NEEDED ANOTHER HAND."  (All of this has been in Giant, by the way.  The women would have no clue what or who you're talking to!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Tell me, O mighty SNARR, just who was this <i>wizard</i> of whom you speak. Tell me, and mayhaps we can be of service to <i>each other</i>."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A shuffling then a huge <i>WHUMP</i> sounds on the other side of the doorway.  Smoke rushes and billows out past the heroes, clearing to see a humongous fire giant looking at them through the doorway.</p><p>"CAN YOU GET ME HAND BACK?  IT WAS THE BAD WIZARD.  CALLED HIMSELF SHIV THE DRAGON.  LAST I SAW HE CUT OFF ME HAND AND WENT THROUGH THIS DOOR."  He points to the doorway with his hand-less stump.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Come then Snarr. There is something you need to see. Perhaps something that will find you <i>exactly</i> what you seek. Follow me."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers something a moment...</i></p><p></p><p>"...Unless you are in some way bound...?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I AM.  I'M TOO BIG TO FIT THROUGH THE DOOR." Maouelue can see it would be impossible to get him out through the door in between them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm...let me think a moment..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(did the seal in the last room look immobile?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It did, yes.  Looked connected to the wall somehow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If you would let me do something...<i>a bit of a trust exercise</i>....I may just have an answer. How well do you feel at the moment?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"WELL...  THAT FIRE DIDN'T HURT, TICKLED REALLY, BUT...  I'M KINDA HUNGRY.  COULD USE SOME FOOD.  DRINK IF YE HAVE IT.  THEY DON'T FEED ME MUCH, I THINK THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"HOW'RE YOU?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah yes, I know we've got a bit here somewhere." He grabs a few rations from his pack. "Ah yes, here we go. It's not much, but hopefully it's a start!" He leans back a moment to fill the others in about the goings-on.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The giant eats, eagerly.  (You made a friend!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yay!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"While you eat, friend, we will sit down the hall while the smoke clears, sorry about that by the way, and recover our strength. We'll need it for what comes next..."</p>

<p>As he sees the women, he says, "OOOH, PRETTIES!!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He waves with his good hand.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright, keep your hand to yourself!" He smirks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ok then Snarr, it looks like we’re about ready then. I just need to know one thing. Do you want to do the honors or me?” He pulls out the Mace of Reduction and proffers it. “All it will take is one <i>good</i> strike, and we should be in business.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"MAYBE WE CAN TAKE TURNS?  WHAT AM I HITTING?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads the brief way down the hall and shows the seal to sNARR. “I think the answer to your questions lies here, friend.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I know not what will happen, but if we don’t see each other again, I wish you the best in  your search. Let the name Lumao “Maouelue” Albrek be known as a friend to the Giants.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With wide eyes, he enters the treasure room, gazing at the wondrous wealth and shiny things.  Then his gaze lands on the 'coin' on the wall, and his mouth falls open even farther.  As he moves towards the object, there is a low humming that starts.  Everyone looks around, but as Snarr gets closer to the 'coin', the humming quite obviously gets louder and louder.  As he reaches for it, puts his hands on it, the humming turns into a heartbeat, the now very loud <i>thrumm thrumm</i> echoing around the room and seemingly throughout the underground complex.  </p><p></p><p>Snarr's hands move around some of the runes, then he finds the dragon mark.  As his hand touches it, like molten gold melting away, the patina of the 'coin' falls away and a blast furnace of heat greets the adventurers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue’s blue orbs shrivel a little.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“If I may....before you go...what is this place?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A long time ago, Zalto, the guy up there, split the fire giant ordning so's we couldn't come back to our home in the elemental plane of fire.  We'd been kicked out so long...  I'm not even sure there are any more of my kind over there.  But, anything is better than being here.  Thank you, Maouelue, friend o'the giants.  I will tell others of your great deeds."  He bows low to Maouelue and the women, then steps through the gate and, in reverse, the molten gold flows back up to re-seal the 'coin'.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The group lingers in the silence, in the space that for the first time in who knows how long, was no longer a prison. They move into the room vacated by Snarr gathering in their surroundings. Maouelue asks Benna to provide some light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If she’s still hurt, he’ll heal them up too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll say over the short/long rests everybody's up to full with everything - save the stuff used recently.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is the biggest space the group has seen so far.  Cracks in the floor reveal where the methane gas has been coming from.  Just below the floor seems to be a lava run, which had been eroding various minerals.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “Jeez Mao, you could have blown the whole place!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only exit, save the way the group had come through, is a solid bronze door at the south-eastern end of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They head over to the far door treading around the edges of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects it for traps and locks.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation for both, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(For the party, too - +2 for Bellatrix, straight roll for Benna.)</p>

<p>Maouelue <i>BLASTS</i> into the bronze door, making it flatten and ring throughout the ensuing hallway.  As the door crashes to the ground, a crack grows from the edge of the battered door, growing and creasing...  meandering...  until it attaches to the hole in the floor that connects to the lava run!  The floor caves in, taking Maouelue and Benna down into the crevasse.  Bellatrix is nimble and hops away.</p>

<p>A rattling of a door handle can be heard over the din in the room.  A door opens, steps echo...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The party, licking their wounds, stands to attention...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Step step, click...  step step, click...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>An old man's voice, "Snarr?  Snarr, did you finally break that blasted door down."  He chuckles softly.   "'Bout damned time."</p><p><i>Click, step step...  click, step step...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Snarr is gone. He left through the seal. And you? Which way will you go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s travails are clearly getting the better of his temperament.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>One more <i>click</i> and an ebony staff comes into view, attached to a gnarled and wrinkled hand.  Rounding into view is an old eladrin man, with white hair down to his waist.  He wears it unadorned, loose, and most of it is fly-away.  His eyes are piercing lavender, but he looks worried.  "And who might you be?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...” Maouelue falters a moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...I am called Maouelue.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin nods.  Then shakes his head.  "That may be the name you use, but not the name you were given.  What have you done with my giant?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. You seem to know me old one. As I said before, Snarr has felt the seal. Are you the one that took his arm then?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shakes his head again.  "No, not I.  The one that imprisoned all of us down here.  We all serve The Dragon.  For good or ill.  More than likely ill.  Do you and your lasses enjoy tea?  I might be able to find something stronger, given time."  He turns and starts walking back the way he came.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao leans to the others, “Who <i>is</i> this guy?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They follow a few paces back.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gonna pause there tonight, friend.  I'm beyond exhausted, turning in early.  We'll see who he is soon!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group follows the old elf a short pace to a nicely lit room, which you all notice immediately is temperature controlled as well.  A cool, calming feeling comes over you all as you are urged into the space.  There are bookshelves, desks, and an experimentation table set up, alongside a pair of chairs and a rickety but nicely maintained cot.  Because of the plethora of items in the room, there's not much space for movement.  It reminds all of a prison cell, albeit a comfortably adorned one.  The elder eladrin offers everyone seats and brings over a freshly brewed pot of tea.  He conjured cups for each of you and asks, "So, who's for tea?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue politely accepts.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Bella and her sister are a bit hesitant, but figure it’s best to go along.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles, pours, as well as one for himself.  And the tea is excellent, a hint of jasmine and honeysuckle, very light and sweet.  The eladrin sips and leans against one of his tables.  Smiling at the arranged crew, he says, "So.  I can only assume you have many questions.  I have a few myself.  Who would you prefer to begin?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Please, speak. We are...a bit out of our element here...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No pun intended, of course."  He smiles.  "Firstly, I would know why you don't go by your true name all of the time.  Is it shame or convenience?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have only <i>just</i> learned it. It still sits oddly on my tongue.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would imagine so.  If you don't mind me saying so, that name will become infamous.  If it isn't already so.  You might be able to change that, but...  we shall see.  Now, on to better things, what exactly brought you to the bowels of the Fortress of Frozen Tears?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The words seem to unsettle Maouelue who shifts uncomfortably on the spot.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It would seem I am led here by more than one thread of fate, if everything I have heard these past months is to be believed.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"And which threads would those be?"  He sips his tea.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a deep breath before speaking.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I was told...I have a brother here. A brother whom I have never met.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin nods, encouragingly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We seem also to follow, or be drawn along, in the wake of a mysterious Runemark. Giants and Dragons and Naga....oh my. It’s quite a tale in its own right...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It led us to the Summer Eladrin...the city of Starlight...” <i>The Mage’s voice drifts off into a minute reverie...</i> “And now here, under the frozen Fey tundras have we slipped and fallen on the slide of hubris, and though I feel nearer my destination than ever, the more I feel it sliding away.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nay, lad, you're not sliding away.  Although, the path ahead is extremely treacherous indeed.  As you've already seen."  He looks meaningfully at the trio.  "That being said, what little aid I can give you, I shall.  On one condition.  There is a spell that I have been trying to break for some time.  It seems the mage who locked myself and my cohorts down here liked to play with planar binding magics.  In the castle above, there is a crystal which should be the source of the binding.  Search this out and destroy it, and my aids will not be given in vain.  Is this acceptable?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue nods, reverently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We will break the stone. But pray, give us your name...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles.  "My name...  is Aeneir."  (History check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue recognizes the name immediately, but many of the stories he's been told are a bit hazy as they were told to him as a child.  Aefir had a younger brother, Aeneir, who was a great mage.  A seer.  It is said that through Aeneir's divination magic, Aefir was able to know about his destiny.  If this eladrin is serious, he would have to be way older than the Summer Court members, and, quite possibly, the oldest elf in all of the planes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Æneìr?....</i>”</p><p></p><p>“<i>Can it be?...</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It can.  And is.  The damnable wizard we both seek conjured me up from the aether and bade me do his bidding.  I've been on death's doorstep for millennia.  It would be good to...  take the next step.  That is where you and your retinue come in."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What can you tell us about what we might find above?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A castle of ice and frost.  I'd wager you'd do well to find boots that grip the ground or you'll be sliding constantly.  It has been some time since I last traversed the palace... but both our wizard and the Pale Prince enjoy their...  creatures.  Abominations lie in wait, and more than likely a guard for the crystal.  Wits and cunning will go a long way, too.  Did you have any <i>special</i> requests in mind?"  He smirks and sips more tea.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Can you sense the presence of a half-elf that recently disappeared from here? He was of our party when...the demon...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir looks sadly down at the ground, then up to meet all of the eyes staring back at him.  "Sense... no.  But his destiny lives on past this day.  You may yet find him on the material plane.  Or maybe your ancestors will.  It's times like this I miss my eyeglasses.  I used to look over the top of them when I said things that profound."  He chuckles and pours more tea, offers to the rest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The group looks stricken for a few beats, then....</p><p></p><p>“Do you insinuate some other <i>special</i> that you would grant us in hopes of fulfilling this duty?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There are boons...  and there are boons.  It would depend on what you feel you need, but...  I'd like to be of some service to your party, yes."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Most gracious of you indeed. I do feel there is <i>something</i> missing as yet from our fold..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I fear our deficit may be a direct result of my, ahem, penchant for impetuousness. Perhaps summat that would allow me to either prevent or assuage harm that I might cause along the way. Something to protect those around me. I am a mage, but also a man of metal. The Platinum wants not but for zeal..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin smiles kindly at the mage.  "There is no deficit, although I understand why you would feel that way.  All you need to do is ask.  I can only give what I have, but it might be that the stars will align?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Please then, give us this boon. We ask in the name of Albrek."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He narrows his eyes, eventually nodding and closing them.  He raises his hands at the Dragon Mage, a gold glow surrounds Maouelue...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and you'll find three pairs of boots outside the room."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>!item boots of the winterland</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We are most grateful for these gifts. On the edge of a knife, it helps to keep one's balance. May our mutual ends be met with such true aim."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can we rest here and prepare new spells?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!  And, speaking of resting, Imma pause there for tonight, sir!  Hope the packing is going well.  Talk to you tomorrow?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Thanks man! Those are cool boons! I'm gonna rethink completely how I'm approaching spell prep. Not sure if there's a way to add that boon in Beyond or Avrae, but we'll figure it out.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would suggest putting the boots on before your long rests.  You can attune to them properly that way.  Also, I know you ladies have not had a proper rest.  Here.  Take this and be well."  Aeneir gives the women a glass of something.  "I'll just be writing here at my desk.  Please rest, and let me know if you require anything else."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye, we will take rest here and plan for the trials ahead. Thank you Æneìr. May this be the beginning of a new era here at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group takes the rest, getting things together, planning for the next steps of the mission.  The liquid in the glasses that the ladies drank healed their exhaustion and let their short rest work as a long rest.  Everyone has new boots, and before long, everyone is ready to trek out.  (Anything you'd like to do or discuss in the interim?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I have to take Quinn to soccer. I still have to rejigger my spells. I’ll do that tonight probs.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, brother.  Have fun with soccer!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Pray, before we go, I would ask of you one more thing. Would it be too much to ask for a handwritten spell scroll, something of your design. I am first and foremost a scholar, and should I...we make it out of here alive, I would be honored to add another page in your history back at our academy."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir's back is to the group, writing at his desk.  Maouelue sees his shoulders briefly raise a couple times, and he turns in his chair rolling up a piece of parchment. </p><p></p><p>"Great minds, and all that," he says as he hands the rolled up parchment to the mage.  </p><p></p><p>As Maouelue grabs it, Aenier holds on to it for a beat, not letting it go.  "It will only open when the time is right.  This is the most powerful magic I know.  Follow your path, seek to do what is right.  And your group will see days upon days."  He smiles and releases the scroll.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue bows reverently and accepts the scroll with two upturned hands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir leads the trio back out of the room, into the hall and past a couple more closed doors until they reach a hallway moving south and grading up.  "Take this way through the mountain.  It will twist and lead up, eventually ending in a door.  This will lead you to the lowest level of the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  Good luck, and may the gods bless you all."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks deep into Æneìr’s eyes and sees the countless ages told there in every freckle of the iris, the darkest depth of his pupils. </p><p></p><p>“Until we meet again, Master Æneìr.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can’t resist the special/accent characters lol and now it autocorrects to that haha)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So Torn between upgrading cure to be a BA or something deepsier like making guiding bolt a BA.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cure feels like, meh I could just use healing word, but healing word is only good because it’s a BA. Would be nice to just have one spell to take care of both, but the idea that you could guiding bolt and then attack with adv on same turn is sick as well.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Up to you, good sir!  Lots of options with that one 😃)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Guiding bolt seems like more fun! I’m gonna do it)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They walk on down the hall</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Works been ramping up...  might be a bit before I can continue on, but I'll get back to it as soon as I can!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! Busy over here anyway!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The group moves into the corridor, watched by a smiling mage.  After some looking back and waving, the party moves beyond visual of the legend and starts to make their way up the long, claustrophobic corridor, towards their long-awaited goal.  The heat is intense for some time, especially since they had been resting in an air-conditioned room for a time.  It evens out soon enough, however, as the passage starts to climb.  Several portions actually are carved into short flights of stairs, and there are many cut-backs and turns throughout their journey.  It widens out at a point, also, where the trio can walk side-by-side.  

After long trek, always moving forward and up, the adventurers finally make it to an icy covered floor which leads into a frozen, frost-rimed room.  In front of them is an enormous block of ice, on which is carved: *For those who wish to proceed, know this - the tests are for the true heir.  None but they shall pass through.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Below the writing, carved in the ice, is a dragon mark.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 is updated!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hey brother, hope the move is going well!  I've been getting things together for Monday and for continuing this story, so I apologize about the lack of posts.  Feel free to pick it up when you can, no rush.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! The place is coming together. What an embarrassment of “things” we have! Sooo many boxes. Really stoked for this part!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage casts a couple of furtive sideways glances at the sisters and moves closer to investigate the sigil more closely.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally understand too many 'things'!  Still have a basement to liquidate of too many 'things'!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon mark looks to be a signature, the same as the one on the giant gate below.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This, but more blue and white and frosty!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a hallway with stairs leading down to the south; all of the steps and walkways seem to be either ice blocks or stone iced-over stone.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Are everyone’s boots secure? Come, follow me as far as this the place will allow.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads them South down the corridor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The women nod quietly to Maouelue and follow.  Thirty feet S the hall opens up on the left (E) into a large, circular room.  In the center is another large brick of solid ice, but there looks to be something inside of this one.  It's in the center of the room, on a small island connected to the outer walkway by a wooden bridge.  The water around it sloshes as if there was a current or something underneath the surface causing it to move with a current.  The room is lined with bookshelves, completely filled to the brim. They all are iced in place, however.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are three halls branching from the outer circle - two to the NE, one directly S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao raises a hand to the ladies to hold their position, then sets a tentative foot out on the bridge, testing its surface before moving fully across.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It holds, but there is movement in the waters underneath the mage.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He sends Fammy down for a flying lap around the water as he takes a step back.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Fammy's the frog, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I forget. I was thinking Hawk still for now.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Maybe Fammy was the bat?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, you want him to skim the water, flying over it, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ya. Say 5ft above it.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>🤮</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, he killed Kenny!!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You bastards!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's bat flies out to scope the area.  It's not very big and the bat makes quick work of it.  It's definitely a magical water, as it's not frozen, however not much more can be gleaned.  As it's making a last pass, a tentacle shoots out of the liquid and snatches it out of the air, and brings it below the surface.  At that moment, Maouelue loses connection with his familiar.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dinner!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks at the water below with concern and sends a cursory ice blast down to roil its surface.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>As Maouelue reaches for the 'water', he finds he's unable to grasp it.  It feels like liquid to the touch, but he is unable to form it through magic or take away any in cupped hands.  His hands are completely dry when lifted out of the liquid, too.  (Dex save, please!)</p>

The solid block of ice is over six feet tall, four feet wide, and about as much deep...  and has something inside.  Maouelue looks with several vantage points and a picture is put together.  A humanoid is frozen in the middle of the block of ice.  As the mage peers closer, words begin to etch themselves into the front of the ice block:
*Peer into the liquid and see what lies below.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage resigns himself. </p><p>“Alright...I guess I’ll have to do this the old fashioned way...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks down in the water to find a trace of the beast lurking within.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The eladrin longbow is drawn.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pool is warm to the touch.  As Maouelue peers into the depths, fathoms appear before him.   It is impossibly deep, and, at the bottom, a massive beast circles the pool.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seconds feel like minutes as he watches the ominously graceful monster maneuver what for it is a small space.  Suddenly, red eyes, three stacked on top of each other, snap up towards the Dragon Mage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It swims, cautiously, towards the surface.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The humongous creature hovers mere feet from Maouelue, red eyes darting hither and yon, not seeming to focus on anything.  Then, they snap forward, freezing the interloper where he is.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Telepathically, it says to Maouelue, <i>"Am I not the most impressive, the most powerful and magnificent creature in all the worlds?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You are not.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“That honor lies with the Platinum.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Deep within your mind, hidden away for some time, you hear purring of an ancient dragon who is well pleased.</p><p>With the first word, the beast begins to open its mouth.  But with the second, it cocks its head and its body twists oddly.  With the last, it blinks.  Maouelue gets the feeling that, if it could smile, it would.  Then, it disappears from the liquid, fading away into particles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmph...well then...<i>very impressive...</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue raises from the pool, Bellatrix touches him on the shoulder to make sure he's okay.  "Whatever you did, it must have worked.  The doorways all...  flashed.  Wouldn't have like to see what might have happened if we tried to go through without...   whatever it is you did."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Praise Bahamut.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let’s go left...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trio move off back across the bridge and around the circle, heading for the northern-most exit.  A sharp right (N) turn leads the friends down a short flight of icy stairs and into a very large room.  At the far end of the room (in the W) stands another large brick of ice, the same dimensions as the other.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao once again raises a hand to the ladies and steps forward, what with being a...what was it again? Tenir? Maouleue couldn’t remember, but at any rate he <i>feels</i> like a chosen one.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leans in close to the ice and inspects it all round.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
It looks exactly the same as the other - a little over six foot, four square on the sides.  It also holds a humanoid inside.  As with the other, writing appears on the front: *Place your hand for the next test.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao doffs his gauntlets and reaches out, touching faith.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The others as well?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The ladies are back not touching faith. )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's hand rests on the ice block for a beat, enough time for him to notice that it is slightly warmer than the rest of the room around him.  Suddenly, he is transported to a small, sunlight-strewn room reminiscent of a green-house.  A variety of plants adorn the room, and the colors range through the rainbow, showering the room in brilliance.  Directly in front of Maouelue, a small table holds a very unique plant.  It is potted and just starting to grow, and has a small purple bulb at it's top.  Two small barrels are next to it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue begins by inspecting the lot of plants around before honing in on the contents of the barrels and the plant in the place of honor. </p><p>“What m mysteries lie below this frozen fortress! I wonder if there are more writings in here?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard moves cautiously through the flowering plants, curious and calculating.  Multi-hued roses bloom, hydrangea, gardenia, hyacinth, iris, lily...  all full and exploding in color.  Quite a contrast from the slate blue-grey-white of the ice palace.  As he meanders and approaches the small table, the purple petal atop the newly-sprouted plant opens.  As it blooms, it shows that it has facial features.  The mouth opens to say, in a high, quiet voice, "Welcome traveler.  There are two barrels of magical sap next to my table.  Feed me and I shall grow."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue obliges.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How would Maouelue like to go about it?  The casks are sealed.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He inspects the cask on the left first, checking for how the lid opens, pulling out his dagger to pry if needed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cask is sealed tightly, but Maouelue can take some time to look at it and pry off the lid.  Inside is a deep blue, viscous liquid.  Looking around, there is nothing to transfer the sap to the plant, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He also attempts to open the second one the same way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The second opens, the same blue liquid, just less of it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How do you take your feeding, ser plant?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That is up to you, saer mage," it says cryptically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes out his small knife and dips it into the container on the right, pulling up the viscous sap and proceeds to drop some, like so much honey, onto the soil around the plant.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Slowly, drop by drop, Maouelue feeds the strange plant.  With each drop, the stalk reaches to higher, the purple petals grow a deeper hue.  Eventually, it looks fully developed, healthy and beaming.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, wizard."  Two seeds then sprout from under on of the leaves, and it continues, "One is for you, one is to plant.  Use them wisely."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you, most gracious and well-spoken of flora. Pray tell me, would you like to join your cohort on the sides of this room? I could give your offspring a head start here in this most fertile of soils."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It bows to Maouelue, and raises its 'face' to his.  "Thank you, kind saer.  But I believe I would like to stretch my legs myself."  </p><p></p><p>The dirt starts shifting and Maouelue sees two root-legs come out and breech over the pot's edge.  They land on the table, and with a large, full-bodied stretch, the small plant takes a couple steps and hops down off the table to meander itself among its brethren.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Will these marvels never cease!" Maouelue jests to himself. He begins to plant the second seed and calls out to the plant, "If I may, what are you called, master plant?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Although Maouelue is fairly knowledgeable about nature and even arcane-based flora and fauna, this one puzzles him.  He remembers reading, some time ago, about a species of sentient tree-folk, but the name and exact details of it escape him. </p><p></p><p>"Call me sapling, dear mage.  Once I mature past my smallest stage, I will know a proper name and my place in...  whiche'er world I shall be a part of.  For now...  I am just...  sapling."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Very well, sapling, I shall do so. Do you have a regular "gardener" in this place?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Prince comes every now and again, but he does not tend my family or I.  He is not allowed.  Only the seekers shall tend and reap the rewards...  or despoil us and be punished."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks around for a moment, considering just how many "seekers" there might be. </p><p></p><p>"One more thing before I part...May I take some of this sap to nurture this seed, or am I to be left to my own for such a thing?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sapling turns to Maouelue and smiles.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first to ask.  Absolutely you may.  And may the Earth Mother bless you and the seed you shall plant."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Bless you and your brethren. My kind has a fondness for all things that grow. May the sun rise to meet you and your harvest be bountiful." With this, the mage takes out the emptied superior potion of healing jar and rinses it with a bit of water from his skin, then dips it delicately into the sap. He takes one last look at sapling before nodding reverently and walks back south to rejoin the other, stowing his valuable seed safely in his pack on the way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he walks towards the end of the room, the garden evaporates behind him and his cohorts come into view again.  Maouelue is back in the room with the ice block, staring at a stunned Bellatrix and Benna.</p><p></p><p>"You just disappeared!  Then you were back, an instant later!  This is a strange place indeed."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How are the new digs, by the way?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It's a fortress of filled boxes! Haha, it's great. We are alternating between elation and panic 🙂 so all is normal.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally normal.  Kids having a good time getting their room/s together?  That was always my favorite part!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"An <i>instant</i> you say? Curious indeed. Dear disappeared Daran did tell us about the wiles of time in this place... Let us just say, that I think I've passed the first test. Let us move on, counterclockwise."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, the kids room is looking good. They've each got their own bookshelf. We're getting Cate's brothers' old bunk bed in the next few weeks here too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice!  They're going to LOVE that!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trio exits the room, retraces their steps back to the wooden bridge, then S to the exit there.  They continue into a small, cold room, with hallways moving off to their left and right (E and W).  Maouelue can see the E hall opens into a pool of liquid, rectangular this time.  The W room has odd angles and a further exit can be seen on the far wall.  (Roll20 updated.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue moves left down the East hallway to the pool and sets about inspecting it.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is a decent size, rectangular, and very, very cold.   There are motes rising up from the pool, which has been completely iced over.  From the ceiling hang dangerous icicles.  Frost and ice slicks spatter the walls here, as if water had been flung at it and it froze instantly.  Even with all of the warm weather gear, Maouelue's bones ache and he can hear the women's teeth chattering loudly behind him.  As he peers into the frozen waters (definitely frozen and not like the arcane liquid in the circular room), he sees something frozen in the pool...</p>

<p>The ice crackles a bit as Maouelue is looking through the frosted surface.  There seems to be a pulsing happening deep within the pool.  As he watches, a shimmer seems to ripple at the very bottom.  Moving his head makes the shimmer move throughout the pool itself.  Then it hits him...  he's looking at dragon scales.  Shimmering with the light of Bellatrix's torch.  Benna gasps, Bellatrix nearly drops the light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maoulue takes note of this and beckons the ladies back out of the hall. "Stay here at the crossing," He says plainly before moving West to inspect the other chamber.</p>

<p>Maouelue inspects the Western room, and as soon as he enters, he sees a statue of an enormous creature, frozen in place, along the northern wall.  It's actually frozen <i>into</i> the wall, become a part of it somehow.  The odd appendages and legs meld into the ice and seem to flow from the being, giving it a melted, grotesque quality.  Where it's not melded into the wall, Maouelue can see the creature's features fairly plainly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He casts a few cursory investigatory glances around the other three quadrants of the room including the West corridor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Further in, the W corridor bend N and continues down a long stretch which ends with another ice block, similar to the ones seen before.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lining the wall in the middle section, are suits of armor, icicles hanging from sections.  But their silver sheen doesn't seem diminished from being in the frozen environment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Metal Mage meanders by his mirrored mannequins and musters up to the molded mass in the middle.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks for the now-expected writing on the ice block.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the metal mage meanders past the armor...  he hears a loud <i>craaaack</i> of ice breaking loose of cold metal.  Looking behind him, a lone suit of armor steps down from it's dais, red flames appear where it's eyes should be, and it raises it's great sword to attack!</p>

The wretched husk of silver, now dented, lies completely broken on the cold ice floor.  The mage now notices the other cutaways in the hall also have the horrors, but they are not yet animated.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is whisked away to a vast, open field of grass.  In front of him is a giant wall, over eight feet tall.  Just in front of the wall are five beings, what looks to be a dwarf, a halfling, a gnome, a human, and a dragonborn.  The dragonborn can reach up and touch the top of the wall, while the gnome is well away from the top.  There are shouts coming from the other side of the wall, clamoring for aid.  The five are in a frenzy about how to scale the wall.  The halfling sees you, runs over, and says, <i>"Hey mister, we're sure glad to see you.  Our families are on the other side of that wall, we need to get to them quick - do you think you can help us?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dragonborn, you flank the wall, followed by the human; forgive me, I do not yet know your names, but we can deal with the pleasantries later. Master dwarf, you come next followed by the halfling and gnome respectively. Thus you shall form the fellowship of the staircase and scale yourselves up. Human, toss the dwarf if you have to, dragonborn, cradle your hands as a step and your shoulders to boot. The lot of you should be able to hoist the dragonborn thereafter, and if naught else I can provide a push. May these tactics lead you to those who call for aid, and may you provide it well and willingly.</p>

<p>Everyone strains and tries as much as they possibly can, but nobody can lift the dwarf.  You see that, after a certain number of tries, the people fade away.  A few moments later, they reappear, huddled in a circle, discussing how to get over the wall.  The halfling notices you, comes over and says, "Hey mister..."</p>

<p>Somewhat gracefully at the top.  His left boot hits the edge, he slips... but catches himself at the last to kneel firmly on the top of the wall.  He reaches down and starts helping the others up again.  Soon it comes down to the human and the dragonborn.  (Plan for getting them over?)</p>

<p>(We'll say the human and the dwarf were able to attune in the time allotted, but the dragonborn was not.  However, with that jump, he's able to scale it perfectly, using very little strength to get up.  If you want to give me two d20 rolls for strength, the DC is 4 for both.)</p>

<p>With a hefty <i>sproing</i>, the metal mage makes it to the very edge of the top of the wall.  The dwarf stabilizes him and the group now looks out over yet another vast field of blackness.  The world seemingly ends here.  One by one, the people jump down into the blackness and disappear.</p>

<p>The wizard jumps into  the void.  As the blackness envelopes him, it morphs and he feels himself floating through space.  A hazy blueness starts as a pinpoint of light, widens out to encompass his vision entirely, then focuses into the large block of ice with the person inside.  The giant elk nudges the newly re-appeared man, while the boots Maouelue had lent to the small group are waiting for him atop the cold block in front of him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sounds of dripping can be heard from somewhere in the corridors connected to this room, echoing off the frosted walls.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(afk lunch)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well Elkamigo...I dropped off that great wall, came unglued, fell into a deep well, and landed to reform here, <i>and</i> I took care of my shoes! Not bad for a moment's end I'd say!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Elkamigo: "..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I see... you're just staring at your walls..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"But hark! Do I hear echoing footfalls? Or is that just the mire of the cavern? Let me sling up my baskets and we'll ride back down the line."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Elkamigo chortles something sounding suspiciously like "Do what you gotta jiboo."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Love it!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue and Elkamigo look S towards the rooms opening, but nothing presents itself with the exception of the echoing dripping.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They ride South and Mao pulls the reigns up just as they start, thinking to take a closer look at these suits of armor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception for a quick look, Investigation for a closer one, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’ll do perc then see if I get down to inv)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All of the suits of armor are frost-rimed, about 7 ft tall, and each carry a long bastard sword at various stages of presentation.   There are five more, the alcoves they are in only have room for the armor.  They are all still immobile.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dripping gets louder as you move farther S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They walk on down the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Elkamigo and Maouelue make their way through the corridor, passing into the room with the frozen monster...  which is slowly losing its frost covering.  This is where the dripping sound has been coming from, as a small puddle has formed underneath the creature.   It's antennae are sticking out, completely clear, and a portion of it's head is barren, yet the majority of the monster is encased.  </p><p></p><p>The giant elk moves slowly past the creature, seeing it's eyes following the pair.  Maouelue takes his eyes from the beast back down the W hall to the pool room...  and realizes something.  This is where Bellatrix and Benna were.  Yet, upon further inspection of the immediate area, they are nowhere to be found.  The dripping quickens.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue hops down from the furry frame and indicates for Elkamigo to back up into the entryway as he comes closer to inspect the beast.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature for the animal type.  Investigation for...  other things!  Please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The creature's name escapes him, but Maouelue definitely remembers that these beasts live in the ice and snow - usually under it, as a matter of fact - and ambush their victims.  With that knowledge, looking around on the floor the mage sees bits of different types of armor and weapons frozen underneath the massive worm-like thing.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There seems to be a orange-red glow coming from the creatures chest, too.  Deep withing the thing itself.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects the water melting off the form, was this the magical sort or the other? He takes no chances, quickly attempting to form the water once again into a cage of ice spikes surrounding the creature.</p><p>[Shape Water]</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He then reaches out with his feelings, trying to sense the creature’s conscience.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Go ahead and cast the spell, it'll conform to what you're looking to do.  What/How are you connecting to the creature's consciousness?   Or did I misread that?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think I will peer at it’s heart and try to attune to the source of heat. More sensing for reaction than trying to communicate directly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, didn't realize it was a cantrip, my bad.  Roll a Constitution saving throw, we'll see where we are with attuning to what's happening here.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage centers himself.  After a few deep breaths, he briefly thinks on Dieter and what he would do in this situation.  One more deep breath, and he squeezes his eyes close and reaches out with his feelings, with his emotions...  and finds an inferno of pain an anger raging in front of him.  The fire seems to be intensifying, while the emotions of the beast are lashing out at him, even in this amorphous state.  Maouelue feels the hate the creature has for anything humanoid, especially giant-kin.  It's especially fearful of the suits of armor, of which it believes Maouelue is a part of.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's eyes fling open as it mentally begins showing the mage what it plans to do with anything it encounters when it is freed.</p>

<p>Maouelue gets close to passing out, but keeps the blackness on the edge of his periphery at bay.  As the mage made his escape through the area, he can't recall passing his other two companions.  And he can't hear anything now, save for very distant grinding of ice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Elkamigo looks around wildly as he approaches the center room, unsure of which way to go around the circle, yet keen to avoid the all-too-familiar ice block in the center. He turns left, somehow out of force of habit.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pair make their way yet again around the circular room, heading off into the last hallway they haven't checked yet.  It leads to a set of stairs, then doubles back on itself to another set.  It repeats this a few times more, always climbing upwards and doubling back on itself.  Finally, Elkamigo and Maouelue are led into a corridor which branches into two halls.  East leads into a small room with a solid block of ice covering the entire eastern wall.  North has a few alcoves with more suits of armor in them, ending in another hall leading north.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Afk soccer.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you." says the chastened mage to his furry fey friend. "I...I...would be <i>gone</i> without you..." Tears begin to fall from the Sylvan's darkened eyes, crystalline as the freeze upon his face. "I've nearly lost everything now.... The sisters! Oh where could they be?"</p><p></p><p>He slumps down and Elkamigo nestles in to the corner bay to their South, propping up the miserable mage, who goes about tending to his wounds.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The chill begins to reach its way into the heart of the Dragon Mage. He teeters on the edge of consciousness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The halls up here echo with a faint breeze, coming from the north corridor.  Maouelue, as he's healing and taking a moment to gather his bearings, can hear the groaning of the castle below him, seemingly shifting on it's moorings.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He peers warily at the suits of armor, unsure if he could take another onslaught at the moment.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The armor looks exactly like the ones downstairs, just not animated.... yet.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
Maouelue: 38/55

<p>Bedraggled, the mage summons what's left of his spirit to at least try and prepare for the encounters ahead.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aaaaaahhhhh now that’s the stuff! I’m a bit low on my mana reserves but I’ll mana-ge... eh? eh? Oh right, you’re just a beast...I wonder where those sisters could be. Bella might not have liked it, but I <i>know</i> Benna would have at least guffawed.... Oh listen to me prattling on...”</p><p></p><p>He gathers himself and pushes on with Elkamigo through the rows of armor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The suits of armor do not make a sound as the metal mage lumbers through the corridor, the loud <i>clack</i> of his amigo's hooves bouncing around the room.  A right turn at the end of the hall leads to another corridor running E, ending in a right turn.  Midway down, a left 90 degree turn leads into a fog-shrouded room.  Not much can be seen from the entrance to this room, and no noise greets the pair as they approach.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue gets a little dirt off his shoulder and begins to weave, swirling the fog around the room and sucking it into a vortex where it dissipates at the center.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Appearing in the middle of the cleared room is another block of ice, identical to the others.  No frost coats the walls or floors here, this room is rough stone bricks, as that of a castle.  The temperature of this room is very nearly pleasant.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage steps forward, now expecting another place to put his hand.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches forward, placing his hand on the ice block.  The fog reappears around him slowly, emerging from the ground.  Then he notices the block is no longer in front of him...  and that the fog is swirling around.  The swirls become small eddies, combining, colliding into each other.  In mere moments, the mage finds himself in a vast open space surrounded by five fog elementals!  (Before initiative, please give me a perception check!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk for just a few, too.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>They don't speak, but you get the distinct sense that this is one of the tests.  Simple fog-enshrouded weapons appear at each of their sides, and they move into a semi-circle position around the Dragon Mage.  Their red eyes flare momentarily, but they make no response.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue lays down his weapons and sits down in lotus position. He closes his eyes and begins breathing slowly. He says only this, "Discretion."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The fog monsters dissipate and start to coalesce around the meditating mage.  Maouelue feels a pressure building at his nostrils, as if the fog were trying to get in.  He is focused on his breathing, but he holds, contemplating what to do next.  (Breathing in?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He releases hold of his corporeal self, breathing in the fog and meditating on <i>becoming</i> the water, the vapor, the frost, the ice.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The first breath in sends his inner vision blurring through time and space; stars and constellations, planets and their moons, all race by, filling him with awe.  The material world peels away, and after a few more deep breaths, all that exists is fog.  Vapor.  Ether.  </p><p></p><p>The ether forms into a humanoid body, coalesces more into a perfect copy of Maouelue.  It approaches and sits, cross-legged, right in front of the real mage, looking at him serenely.  </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Maouelue.  You have passed the test of peace.  This used to be the penultimate lesson for the dragon mark.  However, the test has been corrupted, Dragon Mage.  Not the whole test, just the ending.  The Prince and his cohort have used their influence to degrade and denigrate the process.  It now does not yield what you think.  It has a solution for you, but it is not what you were hoping for.  The dragon mark is not earned.  It is bestowed.  However, if you are able to defeat the Pale Prince, there might be a way to receive your boon.  Keep on the path, wizard.  You are so close to the conclusion of your quest."</p><p></p><p>With that, he disappears, and Maouelue finds himself back with the block of ice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“The test of peace, defiled. Yes, that sounds just like what I have heard of this charlatan Prince. I feel sorry for him... If I must be his end... <i>sigh</i>... so be it. Though, perhaps ‘defeat’ need not mean death...more death.” With a heaving expulsion of breath, the mage comes to and re-acclimated himself to his surroundings.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The silence is absolute.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A sullen, frosted voice sounds in Maouelue's ear, saying softly, <i>"That was...  unfortunate.  I was so hoping to meet you without any...  interference.  You are more capable than I presumed.  Find me, if you can.  I'm not far away.  And neither are your friends."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Did it sound in the chamber, or in his head? Reverberant or like asmr whisper?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It sounded like it was right next to his ear.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue starts a moment at the proximity of the voice, but doesn’t give in to looking. He takes a steely breath and considers this latest riddle.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He stands back up slowly and pats his amigo on the hindquarters. He leads back down out to the corridor and turns left to inspect the end of the hallway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Moving around the corner, Maouelue almost has a heart attack when he sees an enormous frost giant in the middle of the room!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Then he notices the pedestal and that the being is lifted off of the floor by a foot or so, making him more imposing than usual.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The being is either dead and stuffed, or under some type of spell.  He's almost completely frosted over, but that might just be how frost giants look.  He is in full regalia, too - full giant armor and holding a gigantic shield and spear.  There is also a closed door on the E side of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Afk, kids going to bed.  Be back soon!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cool cool! Supper here in a moment.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Back, feel free to fire when ready!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He backs away slowly, not quite ready to there...yet. He heads back around through the armor room and hangs a Lumao at the junction, inspecting the space to the East.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>... and sees a massive wall of ice.  Inside the block are beings, seemingly frozen in stasis.  The far side of the block can be seen, but just vaguely.  The block looks to be several feet thick.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks to see if there is a way around to see it from all sides.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only areas are the halls he's seen.  Nothing backs around to the other side.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He puts his hand to the ice and wipes away the rime, trying to see more clearly what, or whom lies within.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks into the depths of the ice block, peering into the miasma that becomes clearer and clearer the deeper he goes.  Bones, bits of armor, various weapons, body parts...  all suspended in the ice...  or...  it looks strange, now.  The mage moves back and forth along the length of the blockage, sussing out the contents.  There are definitive striations, vertical markings where it looks like the ice might have frozen against something.... an invisible wall of sorts.  This striation is on both sides, six feet or so from the edge of the side walls.  There doesn't seem to be horizontal striations, but the vertical definitely stand out as he moves across the surface of the ice wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue shudder, privately praying that he doesn't end up a disembodied array of items frozen in that mass of ice. He moves back around to the Giant Room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is sparse, the only furnishing is the frozen giant.  The door on the E side of the room is made of pure solid metal, something very fine (investigation check for material).  The base of the giant is frosted over, but it looks to Maouelue like there's a small plaque near the base.  There are words on the plaque, giant markings, but only the first few words and letters can be seen.  The rest are obscured by ice.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He investigates the door material then tries to wipe away the ice obscuring the letters.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“That’s pretty metal.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Can't quite tell what the door is made of.  It's definitely not made of ice, though.</p><p>The ice on the statue base will have to be removed for Maouelue to read/make sense of it.  (Mao speaks Giant, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(He speaks Giant.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The first few words and letters spell out:

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>"... m a giant, an anci..."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes out his knife and begins to scratch away at the icy covering, trying to reveal the rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The hoarfrost at the top is easy to scratch away, but it gets thicker toward the bottom.  A couple lines are revealed in the scratching:
*"I am a giant, an ancient king
With many a jewel by my neck are hanging"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouleue looks up at the king’s necklace, seeing just what these <i>jewels</i> might be.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is no necklace on the giant.  He wears no crown, either.  Just bulky armor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes out the mace, thinking to crack through the remaining ice, but takes a moment to inspect the Giant’s shield and insignia.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation and history check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The shield is of exceptional make and quality.  As is the armor and the great-axe at the giant's side.  The rimed shield does have a raised insignia, a series of runes that identify him as a bard of the frost giant ordning, who have a major place in frost giant society.  Unlike traditional bards, frost giant bards are specifically runesmiths.  Some of the runes lining the perimeter of the shield give Maouelue a twinge, but he can't put a finger on how he recognizes them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue pulls out his book of drawings and etchings comparing the runes to the Runemark and others he took down in the Muhlen Vault.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A <i>lot</i> of them match up.  Most of them, in fact.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Dieter should be here...” <i>sigh</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Friend.</i> The Dragon mage utters in the Giant tongue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It stands solid and frozen in place.  No reaction.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Psh...works in all the old stories...” he adds petulantly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>I bet Snarr would have gotten it...</i>” he jibes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Considering again, he thinks back to the line about the jewels around the neck. He cajoles Elkamigo over and remounts to get a better look at the top of the Giant form and to peer down inside the armor plate.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

As the ice melts slowly away from the base of the giant, more runes can be seen:
*"I am a giant, an ancient king
With many a jewel by my neck are hanging
Then a monster comes, a heartless thief.
The bite so bitter brings me grief.
It takes my treasure, my riches untold,
My rubies, my emeralds, my silver, my gold.
What am I?"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Tree.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue speaks the word, the giant word resounds around the room, and the air feels like it is being drawn away.  To the E, the polished metal doors move inward, slowly, scraping against the frozen floor.  An odd green glow comes from within the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Kids bed!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns to meet the glow, the steel and platinum of his armor iridescent in reflection. He approaches the precipice and peers in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Emerald green fills the mages eyes as he peers into a modest sized room that is completely engulfed by an enormous, leafy tree.  Leaves spill over an impossibly large trunk whose roots are digging into the ice and stone of the castle.  From the base of the tree to about halfway up it's trunk is a rime of ice, threatening the life blood of the massive structure.  As the wizard looks closer, there are a few leaves, scattered here and there, that look to be frosting over as well.  Glinting near the center of the large bough system is a golden apple, a single fruit, hanging down within arms reach of the mage.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, isn't it.  You see, I stole this tree from another world, and brought it here...  just to watch it die," the feathery voice says in Maouelue's ear.  "That golden apple is the heart of a new world, or could be.  The wood from that tree can create magical items that can transport people anywhere their heart's desire.  To any plane, any space...  any life, perhaps.  One would say it's a travesty that I have imprisoned this wonderful thing in a place such as this, just to kill it.  I would prefer it did not have to happen.  But I cannot allow what it stands for.  I cannot allow it's hope to infect anyone else."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Would you like to see the last test?  Or, at least, the last test originally planned for the heir to the dragon mark?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Mage stoically nods his silent consent.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue could swear he hears a heavy sigh as a blue-white portal appears on the edge of the S wall.  Within, the mage can see a simple, yet unoccupied, tavern room.  A plain wooden table has a white cloth on it.  Maouelue can see something is underneath the cloth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage walks into the room, and as he does so, the cover dissolves away, showing the mage a series of wizard's wands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The one at the farthest left looks to be made of solid gold, set with rubies.  Next is a polished wand of a black substance, somewhere between wood and stone.   The third is an intricately carved white-wood wand, extremely ornate and delicate.  The fourth is a thick wand, made of a tough wood, and is set with small crystals and gems that twinkle. </p><p> It also has runes etched all along it.  Last is what looks to be a stick, twisted at odd angles, scarred along an edge as if from a lightning strike.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A voice comes to Maouelue - <i>"Choose."</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He reaches out and lifts the fifth wand, testing its balance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a heavy wood, weighing down his hand as he picks it up.  It surprises him, the heft of it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He closes his eyes to the material world around him and tries to connect with the source within the wand, if there indeed is any.</p>

<p>A deep sense of calm comes over the wizard.  The small room fades away, Maouelue soars through clouds.  Tufts of white flow by, then part to reveal an immense forest below him.  The wizard flows down further, below the clouds altogether, and close to the tops of the tallest trees.  Interspersed between the trees, at the base of seemingly <i>every</i> tree, is a pool of water...  no...  not water.  Liquid, but not...  water.   As far as Maouelue can see, the forest continues in every direction, endlessly.  </p><p></p><p>Dipping further below the boughs, Maouelue sees sparse foliage, neat grasslands, and, again, thick tree cover rolling across the entire landscape.  The pools are colored in a rainbow of hues.  The vision stops at a massive tree with a golden liquid pool beneath it.  As he looks up, Maouelue notices a golden apple on one of the highest boughs.  The vision fades back to the heavy wand in Maouelue's hand.</p>

<p>The room, table, wands dissolve around Maouelue, with the wizard still holding tight to the heavy wooden wand.  He reappears in the frozen room, but this time there are noticeably less leaves on the tree.  It's nearly barren, the ice now covering the majority of the trunk and even moving onto some branches.</p><p></p><p>"It's an interesting choice, wizard.

<p>"Strong words.  We'll see if they're still strong after we meet.  We're waiting..."  Another leaf falls from the tree.</p>

<p>“Enough of this charade, <i>Brother.</i> Come out and face me.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Tsk, tsk...  It is a good guess, but no, Lumao.  I am not your brother.   He is far away from here.  But he was here, once.  He may be the only person who truly understands my pain.

<p>(Gotta pause there for tonight, sir - fun stuff!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Man this is intense!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue does not reply. Instead he looks upward, assessing where these branches lead? Could he climb further yet? The old feeling of being pulled by strings of fate and power-hungry machinations roils to his core.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he comes to a determined conclusion. </p><p></p><p>This time he points the wand directly at his own heart. He grips a branch from the tree firmly and says, “I am ready.  Take me to him.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a slight chuckle, and the thin voice says, "I believe you have the wrong impression of that wand, young wizard.  But what you ask is...  curious.  I wonder..."</p><p></p><p>A few moments pass, then a circle of bluish-white appears where the door to the tavern room was before.  It widens out until the circle reaches from the top of the wall to the bottom, and stretches to fifteen feet across.  Through the door, Maouelue can see a blank white space, akin to the clouds he was just floating through.  Farther in, he can see the bottom half of a person dressed in black robes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue descends from the tree, more of the person on the other side of the rift becomes visible.  Standing comfortably, arms tucked into the front pockets of his robes, stands a young-ish man, human by all accounts, with a scraggly black goatee and dark black, lank hair hanging down.  He has a hint of a scar on his forehead that detracts a bit from his emerald green eyes.  He does not smile, nor does he scowl.  His countenance is...  very difficult to read, actually.  His robes are a good make, black again, and underneath, what Maouelue can see, are well made - possibly nobles? - clothing.  The boots are polished and impeccably shined, although they seem to be older.  The man gives off an air of intelligence, contemplation, and just a hint of smugness.  He eyes the wizard walking towards him.</p><p></p><p>In an almost monotone, very little inflection in his voice, he starts, "I wasn't expecting to be seeing you in quite this manner, brother.  What have you gotten yourself into to have the Prince connecting us like this?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed, Brother, this was not how I expected it to be either. Funny, how everyone seems to know me already in these parts, yet, I suppose that’s natural for a rightful heir. Yes, I have come to reconcile my past with the Eladrin....,” he pauses a pregnant beat and searches deep in his pack for something, “...Father bade me deliver this to you.” He proffers the old scroll that Shi’Vandos had prepared for this very moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(And to think...we could have just walked back to the Barrow from Oakhurst!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(To think, all of this started with a one-shot!!!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

We still have unfinished business, wizard."</p><p></p><p>Shi'Veilan nods, then says, "Unroll it for me, Lumao.  I can read it if you hold it for me."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He nods and obliges, a misty sadness now coming over his eyes. This was not right. It shouldn’t have been like this, here, underground. Nevertheless, who knows when he might have the chance ever again. For Bahamut’s sake, he may not live to tell the tale of this very place at all!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Upon thinking of Bahamut, there is a shiver in the tree.  It seems to be bolstered, at least momentarily.  There is an intake of breath, but it does not come from Shi'Veilan.  </p><p></p><p>The dark man on the other side reads, nodding.  After a time, he looks up to Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>"Have you read this, brother?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(You're holding it up, he's just proffering it to you.)
(Insight check if you want more of his though process.)

He nods, saying, "Respectable.  Not something I would have done, but commendable nonetheless.  I would like to understand why it is I was summoned here - if it was pure curiosity or something more - but first I would like to make one thing absolutely clear:  We are brothers in name only.  As far as I have thought of or regarded our father, he is the seed from whence I've come, nothing more.  Any thought to my 'mission' or honoring his 'legacy' is complete idiocy and I would stem it sooner rather than later.  My search for the dragon marks and their history is purely my own.  Are we in accord?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I don't play any part in it.  Whatever happened in the past is the past.  For now at least.  If I am able to put the events in the right order, however, you're after the dragon mark.  Father told you it was our lineage.  And since there was no word of a mad mage gallivanting around with the mark, he thought I failed?  Or had he known from the start it was a fool's errand?  Either way, it seems he's convinced you, for blood or glory, to do what he would not.  Have you realized the truth yet, Lumao?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"A wise fool once told me that we are all pawns in the game of life. Perhaps that is so. What motivation would you give me otherwise to bestill the words of the man that I know?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Words are meaningless - I would urge you to judge with your eyes.  What have you <i>seen</i> of your father so far, hmm?  Told you of his existence well into your life, only to set you on a path he would not dare tread?  Inform you of a history, a family you've never known only to rip it all away from you the next second?  You're not the first he's done this to, and you will not be the last.  He is the basest form of evil - a truly selfish man without compulsion to be better.   Yet he would dangle his 'legacy' over other's heads as a treasure, only to lead them down a primrose path.  </p><p></p><p>"No, I would not give you motivation based on words, lies, Lumao.  I would instead have you see what end your father has brought you to.  There are but two ways out of this tower - one is death; the other is owing the Pale Prince.  Either are shackles, and there is no boon to gather.  All is villainy and woe.  This was set from the start.  You and I were but a sacrifice, an offering from our dear father.  I only hope, one day, that I can repay his favor."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A tear begins to fall from Maouelue’s left eye. It freezes before it hits his trembling lips. He had never felt so cold before. Here in the dark, in the churn once again, those cold brutal words take hold in a deep recess of Maouelue’s spirit. He stifles a croak before he replies, “Thank you brother. I see the truth in your words. I understand your anger. May we meet again some day, somewhere that the Summer’s light still reaches.” A beat, then, “There is however one thing I hold that is truly mine own and of which no circumstance shall leave me bereft...</p><p></p><p><i>Hope.</i></p><p></p><p>Goodbye Shi’Veilan. May the light of the Eldar find you again.”</p><p></p><p>With this, Lumao Albrek turns away to face his fate. </p><p></p><p>“Come Prince. Let us end this.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The monotone delivery of his brother's words still in his head, Maouelue feels more than sees the messaging portal vanish.  Looking back on the tree, it still has a handful of leaves on it, but the ice has fully invaded the bulk of the branches now.  In the outer room, Maouelue hears a loud scraping sound, of stone on stone.</p><p></p><p>As he peers back into the statue room, the frost giant is slowly rotating, showing a recess underneath the floor.  The statue comes to a halt, and a spiral staircase starts rising into view.  It curls up, up, touching the ceiling and moving through is, as if through an illusion.  Moments later, the stairs come to a halt.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue, like the tree beside him, feels so very close now. Maybe his release will finally come. He resigns himself to the ascent.</p><p></p><p>“I’m glad Dieter isn’t here to see this.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue takes his first step up the staircase, he hears a crackling behind him.  His head snaps over to see a blond haired man in a brilliant platinum breastplate, short red half cape on his back, bending over and examining the fallen leaves at the base of the tree.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Does he look like Bahamut from under the Vault or does he appear different.?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cool. That’s who I thought it was.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Could it be?” Maouelue turns back to his patron and genuflects. “Master, of all the times and all the places, you are most welcome here. I am slipping on the brink of failure. I pray for your guidance, oh lord of Dragons.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The man looks up, his smile genuine, but Maouelue can see there is hurt, too.  </p><p>"Please, I am not your Master, yon mage.  Just a messenger.  Bahamut smiles upon you and your goal, Lumao.  He wishes to aid you however he can.  I see you have found the wand of Celestia.  Bahamut will be pleased his chosen is wielding such a powerful aid."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Of course of course, I am yet but a fledging servant and cannot fathom the mysteries such as they are. I accept His grace and can feel the starlight returning to my heart through the sheer proxy of His presence. </p><p></p><p>The wand of Celestia, you say? What can you tell me of its lineage?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He chuckles, softly.  "Tis a long and storied history, in truth.  There once was a being who desired a hallmark, of sorts, from his travels through the planes.  It came upon a golden pool, and a tree that grew nearby.  So fascinated by the tree it looked upon it for ages.  As if granting a wish, the being stared long enough to see a single golden apple appear.  The apple was plucked, the being went off.  Soon after, the being was hungry and ate the apple.  Not wanting to waste the precious seeds, he planted the core in his own garden, which was magical.  The tree grew, sans pool of course.  As it grew, the being looked for another delicious apple to grow.  But nothing happened, and the being grew frustrated with his souvenir.  As time went by and the tree refused to bear any fruit, the being became angrier and angrier.  Eventually, incensed at his prize, he ordered the tree cut down, and to have it made into a variety of different items."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A limb of the tree went to a wand maker of particular lore.  With a core as the heart-string of an ancient platinum dragon, the Wand of Celestia was born.  It has some peculiar properties, mostly healing and the like.  Legend says it has special properties for certain carriers, as well.  Either way, I should dare say it will help you in a bind," he says with a wink.</p><p></p><p>He moves to the tree.

<p>"Much...  and not much at all.  His history before this place is well known.  He is the son of Oberon and Titania, fell in love with a mortal.  When she learned of what he truly was, she demanded he make her immortal, too.  Surprisingly, he told he he could not, and she spurned him.  She went off to become one of the most feared witches in all of the planes.  While he...  he slipped into a deep depression that never left him.  It became him, made his world.  He was transfixed with pain and loss, and his world changed with him.  His parents hadn't the heart to truly exile him from the Feywild, but he would not be again allowed within the walls of Astrazalian, or even on the island at all.  He closed himself off within this prison of pain, and that's where his known story ends.</p>

<p>"One more thing do I know, however.  There was a lich that visited this realm some time ago, when he...  it was just gaining power.  Every dragon mark has a signature.  True carriers of the marks can feel the presence of others.  Very few true dragon marks exist in the universe or among the planes currently.  False ones, however, carry their own...  stench.  If a dragon mark is specifically used for dark magic, the Five can feel it.  This place has been the core of a dark-essence dragon mark for some time now.  We know not what it is being used for, or why it was put here in the first place.  There have only been two known usages of this mark... and I would be interested to know who and why they've been used before.  Our sight is clouded from such things.  As powerful as we are," he says, smiling again.</p><p>(Full rest, btw!  From him touching you.)</p>

<p>Maouelue smiles back now. The first time he's felt truly inclined to do so in quite some time now.

<p>The blond man purses his lips, looks hard at the Dragon Mage.  Then he nods slightly and closes his eyes.  A golden light, soft and almost imperceptible, surrounds him for a moment.  He opens his eyes, regards Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>"The last I was able to see, he was entering in a small chamber...  an examination room of sorts.  I should warn you, time in the Feywild is a trick unto itself.  It could very well be that there is much to his tale after this point.  However, this is the last image I was able to see of him... and his cohorts."</p>

<p>Wand in hand, Maouelue begins to ascend the long and winding stair. Not to be left standing there, he brings himself to the Prince’s door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice reference!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue ascends, his padding makes no sound.  Softly, he climbs.</p><p></p><p>The stairs end in a door made of solid, clear ice.  Inside the ice can be seen a multitude of bones, stripped clean and bleached white.  The ice is about a foot thick, but as the mage puts a hand on it, it moves silently inward.  </p><p></p><p>The space within is monstrously long, ending in a throne made completely of bones and frozen over.  Atop it sits a very white, emaciated being.  It has dark black hair, sunken beady eyes, and wears a lopsided crown of silver.  The Prince wears long, blue-white robes of a shimmery material.  He sits on the edge of the throne, waiting, tense.  Not looking straight ahead, he appears to be studying a hovering, shifting thing off to his left.  There is a similar object to his right, and a monstrous shard of crystalline ice behind him.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue realizes, if he can see details at this distance, the Pale Prince must be very large.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hail, Pale Prince. So we meet face to face at last. Tell me, is all of your despair and treachery worth the cost? Would you not instead seek healing and repentance? Is your spirit indeed so far gone that all you care to do is watch things die?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Then, my pity is yours, whether you would have it or not. Would you care for a final release?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Yes.  That I would," he says, thinly.  "But before we get to that, you shall have your last test."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"So be it."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Pale Prince  rises to look at Maouelue at the end of the hall.  The Prince waves a hand and the hovering objects to the side of him become clear to the mage.  Hanging suspended above the ground, encased in an icy cocoon of sorts, are Benna and Bellatrix.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Your test is simple.  Choose which one lives ad which one dies."</p>

<p>The magical bow seems to draw in all of the spectres as Maouelue does the string, it’s very wood grain glistening a pearlescent aura, blinding. As he releases the nocked arrow, all of the light from the bow and room together  streams into it, tracing across the room in a trail of stardust. The pitiful Prince’s darkness complete, he sees not his fate arriving. It strikes in the hollowest point of his decrepit being, the heart, piercing the failing globe, whistling an ancient dragonsong in the shimmering acoustics of the room, holy overtones of divine retribution singing the end of this pestilential source. As the arrow strikes, all becomes silent. A low howl begins to swirl and erupt from the deep recesses beneath the frozen facade, wretched now in the gloom, sundering the very ground beneath him as he falls, shattering into a million icy crystals, melding with the frost around him.</p>

<p>Maouelue moves closer to the onyx gem, and it is as large if not larger than himself.  Standing 7 feet tall, about 3 feet wide, and jagged all over, it looks to be more than the mage can handle, physically.  (Arcana and history checks, please!)</p>

<p>Stress and concern for his friends overwhelms Maouelue's senses, closing him off from his arcane wisdom, however he does remember two things in the tumult - Aenier requested the crystal be destroyed, and there is supposed to be a portal in this room that links to the throne room of the Queen of Air and Darkness.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue, not quite ready for such an encounter, moves back to his direly injured friends and priorities their well-being for the moment. He works with Jerry to take them back downstairs to the tree room, also curious about its condition now the Prince’s magic has been rent.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wolf deftly maneuvers the spiral stairs, knowing the precious cargo on his back. At the bottom of the staircase, the frozen frost giant has toppled, leaving bits of giant scattered hither and yon.   The base is still intact, and there is a trapdoor where the giant would be standing.  In the tree room, the massive limbs are thawing, ice water is dripping from the trunk in thick rivulets, pooling on the stone floor.  The floor, Maouelue notices, is lined with small cracks and s lacking much of it's frost rime.  The castle shakes again, ominously.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Seeing the peril they are all in, Maouelue scarpers his plans of getting any rest right now. He looks at the tree, hopeful, yet cautious. He seeks to quickly but carefully take a cutting from one of the livelier branches with a thought to graft it later, hopefully saving the majestic giant in one way or another. He then moves to take a cursory look at the trap door, pulling it up.</p>

<p>Things race through Maouelue's mind, crowding in on his emotions and causing him to have to reread section. Finally, he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and thinks on his family.  Dysfunctional as it is, he has people to call 'family' now.  Bolstered by this newfound thought, he opens his eyes to start again...  and immediately finds something.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Beautiful.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is said to be an onyx black stone called chardalyn that is mined in and around the cold caves of Icewind Dale.  The gem was considered useless for a long time, until mages found it had magical properties.  A hand sized sample can go for over 20,000 gold, so the piece in front of Maouelue is probably worth 1,000 times that.  </p><p></p><p>Usually this material is brittle, but something has strengthened this sample.  More than likely to keep it's secrets intact.  The best way to go about finding out what spell is being stored in any shard of chardalyn (for that is what they're known for) would be Detect Magic.  Barring that, Identify would be another good route.  If one would rather destroy the piece, overloading it with magic should be considered.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of magic on the giant chardalyn shard.  First is an abjuration spell focusing on shielding.  The second, deeper seated one is a teleportation spell.  The gem exudes the abjuration, but the other is more internal.</p><p>(Gonna pause there for tonight.  Great game, sir, as always!!)</p>

Astonishingly beautiful, curvaceous, and, again, wearing just the barest of gossamer gowns, she is stunning.  As she looks up at him, however, the eyes betray her.  Bloodshot and a sickly bright green, the image flickers for a second and Maouelue can see the horror within.  A grotesque, hunchbacked woman with only one eye, boils all over her body, and a gangrenous green tint to all of her mottled black-blue skin, the hag is a nightmare incarnate.   As quick as the vision comes, though, it vanishes and again Maouelue is staring at a beautiful stranger.   </p><p></p><p>"Queen Mab is...  away on...  let's say <i>business</i>.  Would you like me to call for her?  If she recognizes the name, she could indeed return quickly!"  She takes a step closer to the Dragon Mage.

She cackles as is drips down her chest and puddles on the floor, ineffective.  "Well, now, dearie," she says in a now heavily cockneyed accent, "Tha wasn't nice attal, now, was it?"  She tilts her head to the side and moves her hands in a clockwise motion, blue flame erupting between her fists!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue slumps into the remotest corner of the room far away from the doors after tidying up the chests as best he can. He holds the potion of invisibility at the ready and harries himself in to the most functional of reveries. He meditates on all he has been told and all he has read of Mag Tureah. His mind palace's walkways merge with the dark corridors of the keep...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can retcon the potions if you want.  You thinking short/long rest?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue thinks on Mag Tureah, and remembers almost immediately that it is a Fomorian stronghold, with ogres and goblins and unseelie en masse.  A twinge hits him that...  where he is now...  is not Mag Tureah.  It is the Fortress of the Queen of Air and Darkness, her secret, hidden keep.  There should be another crystal here, one that should get him back to the Pale Prince's keep.  The sounds of fighting must be the Summer Court's forces... but that would mean either a good amount of time has passed (which is highly likely) or that the Summer Court possibly changed their strategy.  Or it might be a civil insurrection, too...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Was thinking I'd take the potions just in case I got discovered and had to fight, but yeah, trying to rest here. For some reason thought Mag and Queen's fortress were the same.)</p>

<p>Ever since Maouelue touched the chardalyn shard, he's been feeling strange - as if he can feel the presence of the crystals around him.  A possible side effect?  He's not quite sure, but he does sense the presence of a <i>very</i> large shard somewhere to the NW of the room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>And it is fairly close.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue turns on the spot and, as if on a tractor beam, gets sucked right in towards the source of magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He sniffs for it.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue moves to the W door, almost as if under a spell.  While facing the door, he can feel it - <i>smell</i> it - to his right, and a little in front...  directly NNW.  And it seems to be pulsing.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Now he leans in. He listens to its rhythm</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVN3gNxvIIk

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's a steady pulse, one that brings Maouelue back to his roots...  and then it starts to strike an ominous tone.  Perhaps it's the atmosphere, maybe it's the essence of the chardalyn itself, but as Maouelue listens to the inherent beat of the crystal's call, he starts getting very worried.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue creates a gentle rain to drizzle down upon the hurting shard and blesses it as the water falls softly, slowly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I can't, man!!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Is it a trick of the light, or does he see a tiny Bellatrix inside the crystal, twirling, dancing?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check, please!  And - has he gone through the door?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sorry, yeah he can go through the door before blessing the rain)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens on a hallway to the right and Maouelue immediately sees the massive chardalyn structure.  It appears to be growing out of the rough stone of the keep, branching several directions as a multitude of individual spires erupt from the central core of the boulder-sized hub.  He peers into the gem and can see Bellatrix dancing, Benna cackling, and...  a strange figure creeping in from the left side of the crystal shard.  He can't see quite yet, but it stands to reason that the room opens up fairly wide to accommodate the many devotees who would honor the shard.  The snarls of some nasty, slavering beast get closer, coming from the W side of the room...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The time comes for all of us to face our demons in the end." He says as he pursues the slavering sounds.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>Maouelue clambers through the hallway towards the slobbering sounds.  A loud clanging starts up in the W just as the metal mage peeks into the room.  The crystal takes up the center portion, but there are tables and chairs lining the room, as if it were a ceremonial destination.  Maouelue can see there is an exit to the W, being blocked by a distracted...  dog?  No other egress can be seen.  There is an angled stone wall behind him, and all around the room are stone walls with bas-reliefs depicting the Queen of Air and Light in all her victorious glory.</p>

<p>The crushing abates, the groups collective double vision clears and focuses on a sparsely furnished room with myriad backpacks and satchels on the floor, all around the place.  Stacked against a few walls are swords, shields, pikes, halberds, and general purpose weapons of war.  A few chests are thrown open, their contents picked through.  There are a couple that are still closed.

I have been doing what I can, with her scrying beacons around the keep.  We are many leagues underground, I cannot understand how the Court's forces were able to find us here.

The Queen took a contingent of her guard and touched the chardalyn, teleporting I know not where.  I've been secured in here by the arcane door, listening for more breaches of the castle walls and viewing the battle from afar.  It seems a stalemate at the moment, actually.  The outer walls have been broken through, but our inner sanctum is still intact.  I have seen others escaping via the aqueducts as well - dirty pirates and brigands, the lot of them.  She should have never brought their kind on...  Oh...  my apologies, Chosen.  I did not mean to speak ill of our Queen."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You would do well not to, young one...,” he gives the whelp a simmering look from under his visor as he lets this absorb in the silence. “As it so happens, I am here because of that very...treachery. I come from the throne room in the Fortress of Frozen Tears, if you take my meaning. I am bidden to come and clean up the...” he looks about the room, “mess that’s been created here.”</p>

<p>“Your time has come. Lead on, young one. Take me to the Queen.”</p>

<p>(Real quick ret-con question, should I retain the spell slots for blessing the rain or did that actually go down and have any effect?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can have it back - we'll say it didn't have the effect Mao was looking for and he would have know it before he cast.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The young mage looks abashed, then says, "I'm sorry, saer knight.  I can only lead you to the arcane door.  The knowledge to move past I do not have."  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue is shown doorway with a shimmery opaqueness that has taken the place of a physical door.</p>

<p>"You have my thanks, young one. Your duty now is to make haste away from here." He hands him a platinum coin. "Here is for your troubles. Arm yourself with what you can and now make haste away!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks wide eyed at Maouelue, nodding off-handedly.  Making his way back to his chair and desk on the northern wall of the W room, he starts back up writing, with a <i>scritch, scritch, scritch...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>What part of AWAY didn’t you understand, young one?!!</i>” Maouelue takes a few intimidating steps toward the youth.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Give me those, I’ll see the Queen gets them myself.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Wh...Whh..  Where am I to go?!  I cannot get through the barrier?"</p><p>(There are no other exits, just the arcane door on the S wall of the W room.  Roll20 is up to date.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“One point of egress...naturally. Well, hide yourself as best you can, and <i>give me those papers for the Queen!</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>His hand shakes as he hands them to you.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Your <i>service to the cause</i> is greatly appreciated. You shall be rewarded.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Th...  th..  thank you, saer knight..."  He backs away from Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He steps to the shimmering door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue bounces back from the door.  His hands come up and press against the shimmering.  The hands stop as if a real door were there.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Metal Mage considers the door a moment and looks to Bellatrix, concealing his questioning look from the young elf.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He whispers, "What do you know of portals such as these?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Not much.  They usually either have a word to open them, or they're attuned to  specific person."  (Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix's words hint on something Maouelue remembers from his studies.  These locks need a password, or to be attuned, or they can be dispelled by a spell.  It would have to match the level the lock was set at, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue thinks about Bahamut and touches himeslf...</p><p></p><p><i>I don't want anybody else.</i></p><p></p><p>...he intimates to his patron.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage lifts the shield in the air and activates it.  He moves toward the door, holding the shield at the ready.  As the shimmer touches the shield, it parts, blocking off the spell's energy and creating a barrier around the shield itself.  (As if it were dispelling with a 10 ft sphere around the shield.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Stepping through the door, the trio enters a long hall with statues lining the wall.  Right in front of them is a massive statue of a screaming dragon.  The ones on the wall are made of etched stone, but the dragon is highly glossed, polished marble.  Immediately to the left of them is an animal very familiar to Maouelue...  the man-faced dog is quirking it's head to the newly arrived group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hoy Man-Dog....” he looks at the ground around... “Shit.”</p>

<p>“Ummmm....Bella?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “Ugh...okay.  Sit! Sit boy! Now stay!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue shakes his head and searches about the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves to the marbled dragon and sets his hands upon it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Whomever could you be, elegant dragon? What deeds have earned you this place of reverence?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Looking over the room, the statues are of various elves, all in a state of battle or reverence.  Most are fully armored, almost every one has a beautifully crafted weapon of some kind barred or in use.</p><p></p><p>The dragon statue is very similar.  Very lifelike.  This section has been enlarged from the others, to accommodate this statue and some of the others, which tower several feet over Maouelue's head.  The dragon is 20ft tall itself.  </p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage touches the marble statue, and a slight hum can be felt.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue let’s the hum overtake him, falling into a meditation on the hum’s internal rhythm and harmonies.</p>

<p>(Wisdom saving throw, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The smell of smoke and fire overtake Maouelue's senses.  An acrid, acidic taste hits the back of his throat, and he gags, inhaling even more of the phantom remnants of imagined flames.  His body temperature rises instantly and Maouelue is overcome with heat, causing his armor to heat as well, burning to the touch.  A powerful voice overtakes his mind, adding to the pain and chaos of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"<i>You</i> are not the Queen.  Where is she?  When will my torment end?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do I recognize the voice or have any intuition?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(He doesn't recognize the voice.  Insight check and/or history check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue feels that this voice, if it were embodied, would like to do harm to everything and everyone.  Then his mind flashes back to the wizard trapped in the dungeon.  And the shadow dragon shut up there as well.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He staggers back, reeling and attempting to maintain his balance in light of the horror. He should be more careful with his communion henceforth.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voice stays with Maouelue, the feel of the flames, the false smoke he inhales with every breath.  </p><p></p><p>"I asked, <i>WHO</i> are <i>YOU</i>?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I am Lumao. And I am here for your Queen.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Hmmph.  She's not my Queen, Lumao.  She, along with a <i>very</i> long list of offenders, have trapped me in this hell...  this...  limbo.  One which, even with all of my considerable powers, I cannot undo.  Find a way to destroy this cage I am in, Lumao, and I will grant you treasure and power beyond your every desire."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I already have a dragon patron, one of pure radiant life, light that would scour your darkness from this realm. No, I think you are here for good reason."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The growl resounds around the mages brain...  </p><p>(Constitution saving throw, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ringing abates slightly, but does not go away.  The growl turns into a roar, and at the pinicle, the dragon says, "Today I add Lumao on my list of enemies to <i>vanquish</i> upon my GLORIOUS return!"  </p><p></p><p>And with that, he fades from Lumao's mind.   The marble phases out to the group's eyes, almost as if a blur spell had been cast on it.  As quickly as it comes, it goes.  Bellatrix, Benna, and the Man-Faced-Dog(tm) all look at the mage curiously.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Shaken, he turns to the others. “Let’s move.” He offers nothing else.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group looks around for signs of exits.  There is a doorway E, leading to the crystal room.  There is a doorway NW, and another straight S, leading out of the hall of statues.</p>

<p>(Hey, great game last nigh. I can get back in on this today. It looks like my R20 map is all dark. Can you reveal when you have a mo?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Thanks, man!  I was kinda feeling a weird vibe, but I hope everyone was digging it.  Roll20 should be good, let me know if you're still getting the black-out.  There's a lot of the map that's not revealed, so it could be that.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, still getting the blackout. IDK about the vibe. Maybe? Perhaps it's just that we've been side questing and had to ramp back into this one. There was a lot of housekeeping to do, and it was high time we let that family get on with their lives.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That was probably a big part of it!  I felt I was pushing a bit, too.  We'll see what happens next week, no worries.  Let me check something on Roll20...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The section is revealed in the upper left portion of the screen.  It's about a quarter of the full map.  I tried reconnecting and refreshing.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Hmm, I'm still all dark. Sorry...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries.  Let me check a few more things.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Some of it I think is us reckoning with the mayhem we tend to leave in our wake. There's something about coming back and having it be a little uncanny that I think will be good for our characters' development.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Agreed.  The down time at the Wayside is always interesting, too!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I like that as Buxy and Lyz come back to the scene of the "breakup" that it's stirring up those old feelings.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It would also be incredible sometime, say if we ever do the next film shoot, to do a live game. There's something about the audio delay that can get in the way of those moments where there's a lot of quippy interplay.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally agree - the audio lag is something I don't take into account often enough.  I try to leave space, but I know we're all hesitant to talk over each other.  Great point.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I thinks it's one of those things that can cause the quieter folks to miss their "chance" sometimes. I try to stay aware of it, but it can get pretty chaotic, especially since there is sort of a brewing uneasy feeling about the in-game group right now. I definitely feel that group and individual motivations are at odds in a finely poised way at the moment.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Makes sense.  I guess as long as I'm not completely fucking over the story line, everything will work itself out!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>As the trio make their way through the area, they keep hearing echoing voices, urgent and wary.  The fighting has called people - the question is, who?  The group makes its way out of the small passageway connecting the contoured stone block rooms to an open cave system surrounding the structure.  Just to the right of them, as they ease out into this new area, a wooden pen can be seen.  Within, a monstrous creature with an orange-amber carapace, a long tail with a viscous looking barb on the end of it, six spindly legs, and two massive clawed arms jutting from it's front.  It is using the claws to hack at the wooden beams of the pen, looking for a way out.  Farther into the cavern, more yeth hounds can be heard, yipping.  </p><p></p><p>Around the corner, movement...

<p>Maouelue clambers away safely.  Bellatrix dodges just in time to miss an errant claw swiping through the air.  As they both fall to the ground, more arrows come from the black space, followed by summer and spring eladrin, bows trained and firing on the beast hovering over the heroes.  In a few moments, the cavalry arrives in full, killing the animal and a familiar face greets the fallen Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>"Thought we'd lost you, Dragon Mage,"says a battered Jelentrianna, captain of the guard of the Summer Court.  "There's quite a few folk going to be happy to see you alive and well."  She offers a hand to Maouelue and Bellatrix.  </p><p></p><p>"Only the two of you left?  What of the older woman and the ranger?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well met Jelentrianna! A sight for sore...and cold eyes indeed! The lady Benna is recovering her strength around the corner, praise the Platinum. Our good friend Daran however... he is clouded from my sight. It seems he has faded, if not gone entirely.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"A fair tale we have to regale you with though to be sure! What of the assault, what of the dark Queen?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well met and well found indeed!  The war goes well, it seems we've just breached the main hold.  I was hoping you could tell us more of the Queen of Air and Darkness - we have not been able to find her.  Our magics are clouded as to her whereabouts as well, so we had hoped to find her here.  If you're asking, I can only assume she's eluded you too.  No matter, we will scour this keep and then burn it to the ground!"  The contingent she's with yells heartily and fans out, scouting other corridors bending around.  A large group pass by into the heart of the stone rooms, searching and continuing the fight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Have you completed your tasks, Dragon Mage?  Or do you wish to go back to the Court?  Once there, we can debrief you more on the war efforts."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The Pale Prince has fallen. We were teleported here by means of an enormous chardalyn crystal as foretold. It would seem our intelligence has been our boon. I would have those with an eye for the arcane follow me to the chamber straightway."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It will be done."  She gives a small bow, turns to the group of seelie eladrin streaming in.  Finding someone, she calls to them, brings them over and says, "Illafaera will assist you with your arcane needs.  She is has been instrumental in taking the keep back.  If you need any more aid, please don't hesitate to have a runner come find me.  It is good to see you both."  She gives a small smile, then jogs south, shouting more commands.</p><p></p><p>Standing demurely in front of the pair is a tall, willowy summer eladrin, bright gold skin shimmering in the pale light of the underground castle.  Her long blonde hair hangs loose, all the way down to her waist, but it is as thin and wispy as spider silk.  Her large golden eyes look upon Maouelue with a mix of wonder, awe, and resignation - the Dragon Mage is having a tough time reading her emotion.  She waits, swaying slightly, her white-gray robes wafting in an light breeze.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Your radiance..." Maouelue says as he bows perhaps a little too grandiosely for Bellatrix's liking. She interjects with a poorly disguised cough of annoyance.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If you would, we have found one of the great chardalyn crystals that the Queen's champions have been using. I would have you investigate its arcana. Perhaps it could be of use to our cause..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bows her head, letting her lead you to the crystal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short walk, just past the creepy dog, the group meets around the chardalyn, which a few other eladrin have found as well.  All stare in awe at the massive crystal jutting from the center of the floor.  (Investigation, perception, and arcana checks, please!  Arcana with advantage, because of Illafaera.)</p>

<p>"It seems there are...  spells locked into this crystal," the blonde eladrin says, turning her over-large golden eyes upon Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the wizard takes his time to investigate the crystal, he notices a few very curious things.  First, it nearly mimics the one in the Pale Prince's throne room...  almost exactly.  Almost as if they were the same piece.  The floor does look torn away at the base of the object, and it does look as if the crystal was growing from beneath the keep itself.  There has been several protection charms cast on the chadralyn, mainly to bolster it's flimsy character.  A piece this large, though, could be very hale.  With the charms, it might be indestructible.  </p><p></p><p>There are several spells stored inside - teleportation, transmutation, communication, even a few divination spells.  There is one, however, which is strange.  As Maouelue peers deeper and deeper into the shard, he notices a light inside of it, beating as if it were a heart.</p>

<p>Two of the soldier eladrin, who seem to be taken in a trance-like state, reach out to touch the shard.  A small, soft voice flits in and out of Maouelue's consciousness, saying, "Touch the crystal.  It will give you powers beyond your wildest dreams..."   Maouelue notices several others turning to one another, apparently hearing the voice as well.</p>

What trail of sadness, what scorched earth, what hubris lay in his wake? He remembers the reluctance in Daran's voice, the deep sadness overlooked by Maouelue's own impetuousness and selfish need to find his supposed place in the Feywild.

<p>A few keep their feet, but half fall to the floor, knocked back by the unseen force.  Bellatrix falls, Maouelue does as well, both reaching for each other as the blast pushes them backwards onto the cold stone floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A cruel laugh starts from the middle of the now shaking chardalyn crystal.  It quickly dies away as the ground rumbles, the shard shakes more violently.  Then, it starts contracting, pulling it's many flutes and spires downward and inward, becoming a smaller version of itself rapidly.</p>

<p>Cracked stone from the ceiling falls inward as the crystal retracts from the top of the room.  It quickly descend and recedes into the floor, where it disappears in a matter of seconds, leaving a gaping wound in the castle.  Everyone looks at each other.  The screaming is still happening.  People look from one to the other.  Maouelue and Bellatrix peer from eladrin to eladrin, trying to find the source of the cries.  The scream intensifies...  then they see her.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All are backing away from Illafaera, who is holding her head with both hands, kneeling on the ground, and screaming so hard spittle and mucus are leaking from her head in heavy drops.  Maouelue realizes quickly that the woman could not possibly have any more breath in her body, yet the screaming continues.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He reaches out, trying to stabilize the tortured Illafaera...</p>

<p>She suddenly throws her head back as a small purple-black ball rises from the hole in front of the golden eladrin.  Like a black hole surrounded by wisps of purple lightning, the ball hovers...</p>

<p>(can scratch my last if it makes more sense)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're good!)</p><p>Maouelue, is his boundless feeling for his fellow being, reaches out and touches the elf wizard.  His mind splits, arcing down the center, then bifurcates into more, many more, until thousands of voices are in his head, screaming, crying, retching, whispering ill omens and even worse promises of murder, torture, death.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The small ball of negative light rises until it is above the group, with everyone watching.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voices in Maouelue's mind quiet to a dull thudding ache.  The sreaming of Illafarea stops, she takes in a wheezing, wracking breath.  The voice of a woman - sweet and lilting, like cool water on a hot day - comes into the minds of all collected there.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You have not won.  You will never will.  To those who thought they destroyed my Pale Prince, you will have hell to pay.  We will make sure of that.  For those of you who took my keep and killed my pets and friends, you will die as they have.  Do you not know?  I am eternal.  You cannot kill me.  You cannot hope to best me.  Some will say I have run, fled in fear of my life.  I tell you now, that is not the truth.  As all know, the best way to preen a large group of people is to get them all to one place.  Then, you only need a way to kill a large number of people at one time.  Good thing I've known how to do that since I was a small girl.  Go to your rests with the knowledge that I am not killing the one I want.  Goodbye."</p>

<p>As the contingent warily approaches, Maouelue wastes no time, quickly starting to form a circle of arms all around the chardalyn's relief.</p>

<p>"May the gods be with us!" He proclaims as he drags them all down into the void.</p>

<p>The vault is quiet, with the fire having gone out some time ago as Dieter's spell dropped.  The Druid awakes refreshed and alert.  Nothing is moving, only the breathing can be heard.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Coming to and frowning at the newfound crick in his neck, Dieter Deleter blinks open and awake. A powerful feeling of refreshment flows over him.  Sometimes when you finally allow yourself lay down after a long hard push, your body starts making the decisions for you. So it was now with the Druid, who wincing slightly as he attempts to arise, begins to reckon with all that has happened so far…</p><p>…and all that lies ahead.</p>

<p>The darkness had encompassed them after hours of reading and study.  The two humans went through a treasure trove of books and manuscripts, most all pertaining to the anatomy and physiology of  and their ilk.  There were three, however, in their perusal of the library/laboratory that stood out as unique.  </p><p></p><p>The first, a broad leather bound behemoth, was entitled "Elder Evils' Encyclopedia", with golden scoll-work on the front.  Some of it's pages were ripped and it looked to be, toward the end, complete nonsense.  As if someone went mad while writing it.  </p><p></p><p>The second, a neat volume titled "Those That Came Before; An Overview of Extinct Magical Traditions and What We Can Learn from Them" was mainly a collection of notes from a peculiar wizard, all tied together.  The thoughts were chaotic and tough to follow.  </p><p></p><p>Last, there was a story of fables.  One fable, in fact.  "The Lives and Lies of Aefir Nightseeker".  Jaecob had just begun to read this when he succumbed to sleep.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Curious and refreshed, Dieter reaches over to pick up the fables from Jaecob, taking care not to disturb his slumber. In his many harrowing years, the druid had learned well the power of waking oneself rather than being woken. He peruses the pages with interest. Aefir Nightseeker...that name has a familiar ring to it, he muses...</p>

<p>A good amount of lore can be found in the book.  Some of which was already known to Dieter, having grown up on the Sword Coast.  There is the tale of Nightseeker going through the trials and finding the Eye of Darkness; the story of him battling the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil;  tales of him and his brother traversing the planes, adventuring and making names for themselves.  Some of the book, the front page and several at the back, are written in a very strange script which gives Dieter some trouble (does Dieter speak sylvan?  If not, intelligence check to interpret).   </p><p></p><p>One story sticks out as being important, it is dogeared several times over almost to the point of losing the top corner of the page.  It begins as Aefir finds the Eye of Darkness.  He is visited soon after by two beings - one a massive, red skinned behemoth with curling horns on his head and goat legs.  Standing over 20 feet tall, he looked down upon the eladrin with severity.  The second, however, was another red skinned man, horns curling back from his head as well, but standing just as tall as Aefir, he did not intimidate the elf.  The behemoth, seeing he was not making a good impression on Aefir, ushered the smaller man to go forward.  The smaller man was dressed impeccably in simple peasant clothing, but had on a beautiful black riding cloak.  He doffed a wide brimmed hat with a large, garish feather in the brim, and bowed low to Aefir.  The red man's dark black hair whipping in a breeze, had a tracing of facial hair around his jawline and around his mouth, but everything was neat and trimmed - one would even say... perfect.  The man comes up from his bow smiling, white teeth glinting.  </p><p></p><p>The man goes on to explain that they were inquiring about the new item Aefir had just taken.  They didn't want it, they just wanted to know of the young elf's plans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin suggested that he would destroy it, or even return it to the gods.  The smaller man asked Aefir how much he knew about the item, to which the eladrin replied that he could not see into it's depths.  Yet, he knew it to be a powerful artifact.  The smaller red man smiled, informing the elf that he, and the bigger man, could let him know many hidden secrets of the item, if only he would allow them to view it.  At this time, Aeneir, the sage brother of Aefir, stepped in and warned the young warrior against divulging the item to unknown persons.  Aefir suggested that they would get farther with discovering what the artifact could do with help.  They might never find the true powers of the item without help.  Aeneir, as he was wont to do, bowed out of the conversation and allowed Aefir to do what he would, the choice was his to make.  </p><p></p><p>Mentally struggling, the young elf took a deep breath and nodded his head at the small red man.  A large smile came across the red man as the small item was placed on the ground between them.  Aefir bade them to instruct a to the ways of the artifact.  The small red man approached, eyes wide.  </p><p></p><p>As he reached out and touched the object, there was a bright flash and a deafening boom.  The eladrin raised his shield, covering himself and his brother.  The behemoth cried out in surprise.  When the dust settled, the artifact still stood on the ground, the behemoth was looking on the scene in awe.  The brothers were safe, however Aefir quickly dropped his shield as it was burning his arm.  The large, red skinned man turned and disappeared, leaving his laughter echoing after him.  The warrior eladrin took out his sword and prodded the shield, finally turning it over.  On the front was the face of the small red skinned man, surrounded by scenes of the utmost hell.  As the brothers watched more, the face was twisted and finally morphed into the rest of the background, leaving the shield a scary, horned mess of it's former self.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>From what Dieter can tell, gleaning some words he might have heard Maouelue use, the front page is a description of the book, which heavily suggests these are just children's stories, nothing is to be taken literally.  The back pages, however, are some higher concept, philosophical writing about the nature of these folk stories and their possible truth.  Most are notes written by someone who has been trying to find the source of these fables.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter commits this all to memory, and his pockets, as he stows the book in his pack. His sinews a bit achey as he arises, the impetuous druid lets out a yawn now a yelp now a growl, startling the others into stirring from their slumbers.</p>

<p>After a few reorientating moments, the crew takes some time to survey the scene and decide on the next course of action.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is just as the group had found it - surgical table with rotting mind flayer on it, books and supplies everywhere.  There are a couple chests and cabinets around the room, all closed.  The doors to the vault have remained solid through their slumber.  The downside of that, though...  they're completely sound-proof.  Good for hiding.  Bad for knowing what's been happening on the other side of the wall...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>The first chest Jaecob lifts on emits a gas of green smoke that smells of rotten flesh, backing him up (but not hurting him at all).  The smell quickly fills the room.  (Constitution saves for everyone, please!)</p><p></p><p>Inside are broken glass jars.  They used to house what look to be bits of flesh or maybe organs of some kind, but all have given way to decay.  Green slime and even a few mold patches cover the inside of the chest.</p><p></p><p>Jaecob goes to open a few more chests and drawers, finding more of the same, and some mundane items - quills, parchment, leather for binding, a wax sealer with a block of black sealing wax.  One of the drawers has a small coffer box containing 58 gold and 18 silver.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That seems fair)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(A dragon's breath weapon, which has a 5-6 recharge, only has one option for the result.  With the added variables, I think the limited recharge would still be okay.  Plus, this might be able to scale as Flayco gets older.  If he gets to adult or legendary status, he could potentially lower that recharge number, or add something new.  Keeping it loose with this!)</p>

"Jaecob, could you open the door a crack, slowly now...."

The man consents and moves over toward the stone doors and begins to push. Meanwhile, Dieter spits on his hands and begins rubbing slowly, now quicker and quicker as the moisture seems to expand and forms a thick cloud of fog surrounding them.

Jaecob: "Well that oughta cause a right scare to anyone on the other side, or least ways it should hide us a bit!" he jests as he puts his back into the proceedings of shoving aside the stone doors.

<p>The stone rolls smoothly away from the group, letting the fog escape into the pit room.  Sqeaks and squeals can be heard beyond the moving doors, along with a few <i>oohs</i> and <i>aahs</i>.  A low chittering is heard underneath the low din, and as the fog billows then starts to clear, miniature dragon-men are standing, staring at the newcomers from the portal in the wall.  (Nature check for what they are.  Does anyone speak undercommon by chance?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter produces a small flame and sets it at the back of the chamber so as to produce a backlight for the fog, making their entrance appear almost divine. Jaecob heaves again at the doors and Dieter steps out holding this bladestaff aloft with two hands in the air.</p>

<p>The creatures look upon the image in awe, mouths agape, some drooling.  They stop what they're doing to watch the rock bards magically emerging from their hole in the wall.  A few sacks hit the floor, spilling their contents.  This breaks the creatures from their awestruck attention on the party, some start scrabbling to return the items back to the bags.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Prepare ye the way of the horde."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Dieter gets into the mood of the thing.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few start to goggle at the group whilst the rest try to pack up their bags.  One does and quickly throws himself off of the edge of the pit, into the darkness below!</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Not sure why i'm not seeing notifications for this thread on my phone!)</p>

<p>A few more jump down the hole, but the rest patiently await your commands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the last one drops down the hole, a few moments pass.  Then a rumbling from the bottom of the pit greets the party.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Oh dear, didn’t we deal with it properly?” Dieter posits aside to Jaecob.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Don't know, dont really care to find out, honestly.  Anything we need from this place?  If not...  I think I'm ready to find my asshole of a father."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>It had been quite a journey to find the treacherous patriarch. It would be a shame to deny Jaecob his destiny. </p><p></p><p>“Stand back and ye shall not be harmed!” </p><p></p><p>Dieter beckons Flayco and Shelli to move out before him as a grotesque honor guard, shooing away the remaining gawkers. </p><p></p><p>“Those with knowledge of these halls…step forth and be rewarded.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They have no clue what you're saying, they're just reacting to the tone so far.  They look back and forth between themselves.  One of the ones that fled climbs back up, grabs a would be groupie, and pulls/throws it down the pit before it jumps in too.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ugh, never mind.” Dieter walks out of the cloud and moves to the small door to the NNW, muttering about cretins and fools.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Perhaps his menagerie was quite large enough already.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door grates against the floor but the it opens fully.  Hallways stretch beyond the doorway, hooking around slightly to the right, where it opens into an alcove with two doors leading E.  One is ajar and Dieter can see the long open room with the banners beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes this corridor to be a hallway between the rooms they've already explored. He considers what they had been running from and continues down the hall, listening for traces of the band of thieves they had escaped.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The rest of the kobolds parachute (sans parachute) down the pit, the rumbling subsides as the foursome leave for better environs.  The hallways are dank and devoid of life.   It doesn't seem like anyone has been through here in decades, maybe even generations.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The doorway leads to the hall of banners, where Lord Muhlen introduced himself in all his ghostly form.   The only door that hasn't been tried is the E door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They go to there.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter inspects the door and tries to open it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door opens smoothly.  A small 20x20 room welcomes them.  A door stands in the NE wall.  Greasy ash and creosote is burned into the floor in front of another carcass of a tent, as in the other room with the purple gems.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter brings everyone inside and begins inspecting the room, moving quickly through to the other door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!  Anything specific you're looking at/for?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Looking for any storage/bags)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bags Dieter finds are complete tatters, nothing usable for carrying.  There is, however, a strange area within the tent that catches Jaecob's attention.  He waves you over and shows you a depression in the wall, what would have been the back of the tent.  "Whatcha make of this.  Maybe another dragon egg den?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm, let’s find out. We need more pieces to this puzzle.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes a closer look.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter peers at the stone wall.  There does seem to be a seam in the wall.  One good push, maybe?...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He prods at it with the wave-blade end of his staff.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It feels like pushing into stone.  A couple prods into it, some small pebbles come loose and fall to the floor.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter picks up the stones and closes his eyes, whispering word of the waves waking the water walls.</p>

<p>(You're the best, thanks!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter throes a trio of stones at the depression, and all in one instant, there's an opening there.  A set of stairs greets the adventurers, but there is no light in the corridor beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well well well...the mystery deepens."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Here, this will light the way." he says, descending the stairs.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The stairs open into a library of sorts.  The last one you were in was...  scary and had a carcass in it.  This one in <i>much</i> homier, with a couple nicely upholstered chairs, a few bookshelves, and a very large chest against the far wall.  There are doors on the N, E, and S walls, all wooden and fairly simple.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter moves about the room, looking for any traps and magical traces.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are several magic things in the room, small explosions greet the druid as he casts the spell.  The chest is one, abjuration and evocation magic are attached.  A few books pop out at Dieter ranging from illusion to necromancy, and underneath the rug, a small ping of divination magic.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter raises a finger. “Move carefully in here… matter of fact, don’t move at all…”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He kneels to sense at the magics beneath the rug first, sensing a trap.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He lifts the rug, and...  sees a ring.  Silver, with small engravings of moons and stars on the sides, curving all around it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm, what a curious object!” He runs his fingers over the runes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ring is cold to the touch, colder than the room or stones around it.  The inscription is less runic than astrological and aesthetic.  It has a heft to it as well.  (Arcana or identify spell for more info.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It feels like this ring will give you the possibility of casting a school of divinity spell.  Which one, you can't quite tell.  But there's some serious potential in this ring.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Jaecob, remind me prepare some identification magic next time we reset up. I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot of this kind of thing going forward."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Now picking up and stowing the ring, the dogged druid moves now toward the chest, now even warier with the pings of evocation around it. He steadies his hand and checks for any trapped mechanisms on it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is no physical lock, but it looks like there is an arcane lock on it.  A knock spell, dispell magic spell, or high arcana check will be able to break through it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm," shrugs Dieter. "I am not prepared. I'll just have to see what I can make of this."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter probes, searching.  There is an aura of abjuration magic, protection magic.  It reminds him of Maouelue for a moment.  He recalls the mage's capability with magics, how adept he always was with all things magical.  As he probes, he wonders where his friend was at that moment.  A <i>click</i> brings him back from his reverie.  The large, ornate clasp on the front of the long chest flips open, the aura fades.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well fancy that..." <i>Was it just coincidence? Just as he was thinking of the arcane elf....</i> "Humphf...surely just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>He leans in now with thirsty intent on the contents.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Shoot for Harrison!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(ok, so did I get a level 3 and a level 5 there?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There's also 4,000 gold in rare gems.  Dieter sees four beautifully cut gems, various colors.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yeah, we'll roll for which spells in a few.  Sorry, they have certain sites locked.  Roll20, D&D wiki, Beyond.  Thank the gods that Discord is still rolling!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(NP!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Could be a while for me to get to the tables, but I did find some info...  How about the 3rd is Call Lightning, and the 5th is Reincarnate?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That works for me!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter turns now to the books. If he's being honest he was a bit tired of reading at that very moment, but he could not resist the pull of magic emanating from the various tomes. Securing the chest's contents, he now moves among the volumes, pulling the glowing books from their shelving, reading.</p>

<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(These sites are blocked, too, crap!!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Those sucked, too...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter picks through the volumes, most have a good solid layer of dust on them. he finds two that seems very well-worn but still quite well put together. At a quick glance, there's a broad book that tells of various evocation spells, and how to put them together properly (Reading the book will gain you one level 2 spell from the Evocation school).  The next book is black, with no markings on it.  The inside is blank.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What a strange tome this is..." Dieter remarks, turning it's pages over in his hands and showing it to his entourage. "What do you lot make of it?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Jaecob shrugs and falls into a chair, yawning widely.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well, I'm sure we can prod it for answers along the way." He says, stowing it in his pack and beginning to read the first book with eagerness.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(For mechanics, you'll have to sit with the book for 2 hours - an hour per spell level for these things - to receive the benefit.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok. Also how does that work with Druids who know their whole list already?Maybe He'll need to keep it for Maouelue as a memento...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This is a spell outside his knowledge basis, so maybe just double the time?  Should we roll intelligence after the two hours to see if he retains or understands the info?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ah I see. I think he'll stow the book for now and do it at a rest later.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Let's deal with the mechanics at that point.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter now scans the rest of the room and begins moving to the doors in clockwise order starting at the West, turning their knobs and looking beyond into each space.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I'm up for working something out!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No door on the W, just the passage you came in.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves then to the N door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Just beyond, a storeroom with various sundry items.  Dried beans and fruit.  Some cured meats.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Before Dieter went into the N room, however, he did have to unlock the door.  It was locked from his side.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Come get your fill lads."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Jaecob bounds from the chair.  "Aye, lad!!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes some time clearing out old rations and filling up his stores. Jaecob follows suit and several fists full of meat and fruit are sent to the snapping maws of Flayco and Shelli.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Flayco gobbles with relish.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>But he wishes it were brains.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Sweet, sweet brains.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Full now in belly and in bag, the move to the East room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We'll get you some brains soon Flay...." <i>Pathetic little whelp.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>This is nearly a mimic of the long hallway with banners that you all had just come from.  (If you want to enter this room, we'll have to pause.  I want to give you a good description and it leads to a few other rooms.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(And they took my Roll20 away...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(That's good then. We can pause there.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Wait what!? like your work machine is being firewalled?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yerp.  These people...)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ugh...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Can't say I'm surprised.   It is what it is.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A 100 ft long hallway greets the foursome, mimicking the hall of banners you had just come from.  Although, there are no banners here.  Just tall, fluted columns with scratches at the bottom of them, as if from an animal...  or a pack of them.  The rest of the stonework also have these claw marks, they go up about five feet all around, but no higher.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter takes a closer looks at the scratching, being no stranger to clawing a wall or two himself. What kind of creatures might have done this?</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A myriad of doorways abound...  one on the N wall, 2 open hallways and 2 doors to the E, one door to W.  To the south, a shrine.  A bust of a massive illithid covers the entire S wall, bookended by two flaming torches.  A few lighted sconces send eerie shadows all around.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's strange, Dieter thinks they look like large wolf marks, maybe a dire wolf.  But there are a lot.  As he peers deeper, he sees dried blood between the cracks of the flagstones.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Come Flayco, let us gaze upon this shrine together.” He leads the young abomination over to admire the shrine.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's an abomination, but a nice likeness to Flayco.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Flayco gawks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Come, let’s keep moving.” Dieter says, leading them to the southeast passageway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, dude, a bit tired tonight!  I'll pick it right back up tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I need my Roll20 map and I'm locked out, sorry brother.  Pausing this for just a bit longer.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Keep ya in suspense!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No problemo. We've got...enough options to keep us occupied!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hall turns sharply to the left twenty feet down, the light fades down this corridor.  Turning left, the party sees two doors on the right, one on the left, a hallway on the left near the end of the hallway, and an open doorway at the end, 75 feet away.  A flickering light can be seen beyond the doorway.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A strange sounds echoes down the hallway, eerie to Dieter's ears.  It sounds like...  wet mumbling?</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Did one of you just... wait... no, it's something else..." Dieter looks around to get a direction on the source of the sound and heads towards it.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Ho... ly...  Shite..   gotta get my old maps out here... 😉</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The motley crew of a road-hardened druid, a grimy noble-cum-fighter, an odd amalgamation of a dragon and an illithid, and a giant snail make their way through the torch-lit hallway.  Closer and closer the mumbling comes.  The door is halfway open, and just from the opening, Dieter can make out a cozy room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bookshelves line the walls, most are overflowing with scrolls and parchment.  A large light source seems to be coming from just beyond the door, as is the mumbling.  Wet, gurgling mumbles emanate from the space in the room no one can see.  Flaco gets more and more animated as the group closes in on the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A ghostly voice passes by Dieter's ear, riding a cold breeze.  "Yesss...  this way, druid.  My final resting place is close..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter shudders but heeds the call and moves to follow, his hand at the ready on his bladestaff.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Flayco calms with a look from Dieter.  With a hand on the door, the druid pushes it open more.  An inch, then two, no sound comes from the room save for the seemingly ritualistic muttering.   Then...
*Schrrrreeeeeech*

The rusty hinge betrays the group.  

But not before the illithid looks up from the fire blazing in the center of the room.  With a sick slurping sound, the creature speaks in some strange language, and in Dieter's mind, he hears: *"WHY DO YOU DISTURB ME?"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter grips the Annilus hard and grits his teeth as this invasive voice probes his mind, willing it out of his head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voice becomes a trickle then a whisper as it is forced from Dieter's mind altogether.  Surprise tinges the illithid's face as it feels this too.  He floats-rises to standing beside his contained ritual fire.  Pointing at the newcomers, he hisses through tentacled facial appendages and it's hands are wreathed in a purple-blue light.</p>

Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.

<p>Jaecob, coming to himself after that harrowing fight, touches his head.  Directly in the center of his forehead, a rough edged hole about an inch in diameter, is trickling blood down his face.  He smears is a bit, then falls back prone and lets out a long shaky breath.  </p><p></p><p>Dieter, with a quick glance, can tell this is a ritual room, and one was broken up just as the adventurers got there.  The words and symbols don't mean a lot, but they look Iliithi in nature.  Scattered books and papers are strewn about, but most are written with such a hasty scrawling hand, nothing of note can be gleaned. There are four doors, one in each corner of the room.  (All are closed, the fire is near embers now, but there is a small pile of sticks and tinder next to the papers.  Behind you, the hallway has two branching lines to the W - or your right.

<p>(OMG this fucking citadel!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's a bigg'n!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter looks around the room at his faithful menagerie and beams with pride at their handling of the arcanist.</p><p>"Let us all take a moment to calm our nerves and take stock here. Jaecob, what do you make of this place?"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dodgy place..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Best to keep moving."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agreed..." says Dieter as he notes the myriad exits to the room. "Best start to the left." he states as he proceeds to the Southwest door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He presses his ear lightly to the surface, wary of what the next foul challenge might be, before pushing the door open.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That is the direction you've just came from, by the way.  To recap, you all woke up from a slumber in the illithid disection vault.  After fighting off some kobolds, you made your way through several areas eventually getting to a hall with a illiti-dragon statue.  Moving through the hall and side passageways, you all converged on the door and defeated the arcanist.  The unexplored sections are to the E - which is actually N I just couldn't flip the picture!  If you compare it to Roll20, you'll see it should be flipped 90 degrees counterclockwise.  Sorry...  the next pics I get I'll try to orient them correctly.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door swings wide and the hall you just came from stands empty.  A few doors down that hall are closed.  A trail of flail snail slime tracks from the far passage right into the room you're currently in.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just for expiditious purposes, most of the rooms there are store rooms with nothing much in them.  There is one - blacked out on the map - that has something of note, if you'd like to explore.  Otherwise, the doorways to the E are your best way forward.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh ok. i was looking at the R20 version so it would have been the door across from the stairs to the left that I was trying to enter. Not sure if that scans, but I'll go to the room of interest that you mention.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group opens the door, a soft glow illuminates the room.  The smell of dried blood - a pungent iron/metal smell - hits them all.  On the walls are racks of torture equipment along with various instruments for medical experimentation.  In the middle of the room, situated above a round, grated hole in the floor, is a strange table with holes in it, like a sieve.  Atop it, a familiar sight - a human dissected just like the illithid in the vault room; a Y incision splits the man's thoracic cavity and various organs have been shifted around and searched through.</p><p></p><p>As the light comes on, slowly, the human...  blinks.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dear DEKU!" Dieter shouts as he reels back from the startling movement.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Jaecob, meanwhile, lets out a long low groan of wearied resolve. "Here we go again."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Flayco on the other hand, bobbles over to the splayed form and begins sniffing and licking intently.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the group maneuvers in the room, assessing the scene, they can all see the man is pinned down in several areas.  His head is lashed to a headrest at the forehead and around his neck with what look to be metallic clasps that intricately link to the table.  There are more clasps on his arms and legs, and two large metal pieces sticking out from his hips.  The folds of his chest-skin are pinned to the table as well.  As Flayco starts licking the man's appendages, his fingers and toes react, but only slightly, as if there was a disconnect in the transmission of the impulse.  He blinks again, a bit faster now.  His mouth moves awkwardly, but no sound comes out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>While Dieter stares agog in disgust, Jaecob moves with resolute grit, pulling out his dagger and in one swift motion, laying the poor soul to rest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Attack roll, please!)</p>

<p>Dieter watches the scene unfold as if in a trance, unable to muster the call for Jaecob to halt.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The gracious act from Jaecob is met with an unexpected hitch.  As the dagger lances into the man's jugular, the entire form on the table <i>pops</i> as if a bubble was burst.  Acidic slime bursts onto Muhlen's hands, dealing him 6 points of acid damage, but not poisoning him further.  The goo-man rushes through the sieve holes and down the grate in the floor, burbling all the way down.  </p><p></p><p>Left on the table is a small, purple/white crystal, about an inch long.</p>

<p>Picking up the still slick crystal, it pulses with radiant light - for just a split second - when the druid touches it.  Unfortunately, though, he can't quite grasp what it's all about.  It seems like a normal crystal one would find in a cave somewhere.  With the exception of the radiant light part.</p>

<p>The table is alien to this world, Jaecob can tell that from as close as he is.  The material it's made of is completely foreign to him.  Looking around at the implements, Dieter can see most of them are cleanm unused.  A couple of the medical implements, however, are red with blood.  An odd flask, with an amber liquid filled about halfway, stands near some of the instruments, its top off.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Jaecob, a man hewn from tougher stuff than might be put off by such a grisly scene, heads over to the flask, lowering himself to it and drawing in a waft.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Smells acrid, biting.  A preservative of some sort?  (Perception for more!)</p>

<p>The druid can tell it's for keeping something, especially organs and tissues, from the ravages of deterioration.  But whatever was added to it might either enhance or degrade the effects?  Or there could be a magical component to the micture, but it's hard to say without further experimentation.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmmph...better stopper this and keep it safe." he says, stowing the bottle now in his pack. "Gods be damned this place...."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Shaking his increasingly scruffly head, it had been a long time since he'd had a shave, Dieter heads back out of the room cursing, then looks dead on at the staircase ahead. "Are you ready, friends, to follow me to whatever end?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Sqwaaaaak!"</p><p>"Schluuurpp!!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Grmph..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Alright then. <i>Follow me.</i>"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He moves determinedly to the next destination, wondering if the Elf fared any better at this particular moment. <i>What would he have made of this?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Taking the NE door, the hallway leads to a curved wall and another door, slighly left ajar.  As soon as the first door is open, sounds of scuffling and scraping can be heard from the room beyond.  Yelling in a gutteral language and occasional yipping is heard, too, creating quite a din.  (No need to roll stealth, but if you want to check and see what's in the room, roll a sleight of hand, please!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter turns back to his crew and raises a finger to his lips as he crouches just a bit and sidles up to the door to take a peek.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The door is only open a slight bit, and the number of beasts and creatures inside can't be figured.  But there are some large beasts...  and some creatures possibly training them.  And, amazingly enough, just beyond the crazed action of matted hair and green-grey bodies running amok, Dieter can see a lowered drawbridge and it's mechanism...  and grey stone beyond, a glint of sunlight - <i>real</i> sunlight - splashing on a crag several hundred feet beyond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Blessed be the light…” Dieter lets out a sigh of relief. He takes a moment to check himself over, patting down his various pockets and bags.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Stay here and wait for my signal,” he says the group, then lifts his left hand and touches his golden ring. His form dissipates into nothingness and the door opens gently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh hey, didn’t see your reply.)</p><p>Dieter pulls back the door just far enough to squeeze through, then begins to move across the span and assess the masses for a potential plan, a potential route through. If they could just reach the bridge…</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It might be tough because not only are there a couple rough looking goblins, but they're training two very large animals...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 is utd.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Sensing now the closest thing to freedom he has seen in a long time, Dieter makes his move. He whispers back through the door to his crew, "Jaecob, be ready with your swords. Flayco, this time it's your turn to shine. Shelli...guard the door here." And with this, he moves off to the right side of the room, still invisible, preparing his energies for what is to come.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Jaecob: "Bloody hell..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Before Jaecob can protest further, Flayco flops in and follows his person's orders. Squawking and making a grotesque yet comical scene as he enters into the room.</p>

<p>As the short rest continues, the druid looks around and sees everything Jaecob sees along with the door on the south wall.  It's made of a very strange material, akin to metal, again like the sieve-table.  Odd markings line the entire outline and a rectangle of different material is set into the direct middle of the door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter walks over to the square and addresses it while Jaecob tends to raking the room for anything useful.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The off-colored rectangle in the middle of the door is non-descript, aside from it's different color than the rest of the door.  All of it has a dull metallic sheen to it, and the rectangle is darker that the rest.  The map is available for the taking (or inspection), as well as the potions on the wall.  There's also the individual potion ingredients strewn about the room, you can do a survival check to find out what you can get there.  (Or let me know if you're looking for something specific and I can let you know if it's there.)</p>

<p>"Ah, them.  Ye kill 'em?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Taken aback at the matter-of-fact tone, Dieter stumbles to a few nods and grunts. "I am sorry."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nah, don't be.  They've been tryin' to kill me for years.  Why else do ya think I'm hiding around down here, gatherin' my own army?  They were always tryin' to take control of the Runemark legacy, along with Wilm.  Shits, all of 'em.  Here's the question, though...  ye sure they're dead?"  He winks at you, goodnaturedly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter’s uncomfortable shifting takes on a new tone. <i>Could he be sure? Everything was- is such a blur now.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Insight check, if you want!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I need to get back to the sea.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Not me.  Staying the hell away from there, if I can help it.  I ever tell you about my time with the giants?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Go on…”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(He's genuine.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Where we got our family name from, "The Runemark".  See, my father, that rat bastard, sailed the Sea of Swords all the way across the world.  Legends say he went to Maztica, some say he fell of the side of the world, others mention a portal that took him to the island of the giants.  Whichever way he got there, he got there.  He used to tell us that he was stranded, all of his crew gone, and the giants were about to kill him when he offered them a scroll of wish...  Bullshite if ye ask me, but any way ye cut it, he came back from that situation with the knowledge of giant runes.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Those things are inherently magic, and he could have been an artificer or enchanter, maybe even an evoker...  but what does he do?  Writes on lead and copper pieces a rune that turns them into gold!  And it's an illusion spell, so it doesn't actually <i>change</i> anything, just make 'em look like gold!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Rat bastard.  Created a whole business with those coins.  Traded with 'em, built a merchant empire...  No doubt if you head back to the sea, you'll maybe see a few pass through your pockets.  And people are none the wiser.  Not to say they aren't really what they seem, I guess.  But with all of that power, all of that magical acumen, what does he do?  Swindle and rob.  Great legacy, eh?  Now you know why I'd've just traded in the Runemark magic when it passed to me.  Who knows what would've happened if my sisters or brother would've gotten it, though.  Maybe it's for the best."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shrugs and meanders off to look at the 'metal' door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Anyway, there's a story in my family that a huge trove of real treasure is buried on the sea.  Under that guise, I hired a crew and sailed the Sea myself, kinda tryin' to find the treasure island...  but really, I was shootin' fer a way back to the isle of the giants...  And I found it!  When I got there, only a few giants were left, actually.  There was a small tribe of about seven or eight, and no youngins.  Their magic was still strong, though, and so I tried to barter with them for the magical knowledge.  They had heard about my father, and since that time have never offered their magics up to 'off-landers', they said.  I told them I understood, but since I was there, since I actually found the place, I wasn't going back empty handed.  They were unwilling to leave the island, even though it looked like they would be extinct in a matter of time.  I offered to bring more of their kind to the island, which they took to immediately.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"So, that's how I became a giant runner.  At first, I would go out with a crew of adventurers - mercenaries, really - and we would capture giants and relocate them to the island.  That only worked two times.  The first one was pretty stupid, so he took to the relocation fine, but the second...  was a fighter!  Almost killed the whole crew when he woke up mid-trip!  We got it into our heads that we could find giants and let them know about the solitary island, and that worked much better.  And eventually, as the tribe grew, they offered me my reward...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He pulls up his shirt to show a large runic tattoo laced around his back that goes around his side and travels up to his shoulders.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"They wouldn't tell me what it does, but I've been dyin' to know!  They said if I came back with more of their kinfolk, they would share the meanings of some of them.  Matter of fact, I was tryin' to find some when I ran into this craziness with my brother creating the 'Runemark Army' and taking over the local areas.  Not sure if I'm going to make it out of this, but if I do...  Maybe I'll just find a wizard to tell me what these things mean.  But there's no way I'm going back to the water, not any more.  Got a bad feeling about all of it.  Feels like tempting fate if I were to sail again."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter stands still a long while soaking this in. His minds eye floats outward across Mount Hotenow passing the Sword Coast and out to the Trackless Sea and boarding a Northbound ship. Cold winds pull harshly across patchy stubble as the winds of Winter whisper in early. Off in the distance, somewhere through an icy mist, a land of deep magic and mysterious creatures…</p><p></p><p>His gaze returns to the room and Jaecob then down to the tattoo. He chuckles a bit and says, “Thought you’d go back and do the thing <i>properly</i>, huh?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Maybe.  Maybe I was just hoping for more...  just, more.  More than my father.  Rat bastard.  Thing is, I received the Runemark legacy as we were coming back into port; Luskan actually, and...  well...  A part of me knows what my tattoo <i>could</i> do...  I think.  It's complicated.  But I can use some giant runes, I just...  don't know how I do them.  Does that make any sense?  Sometimes...  I think I'm crazy, ya know?"</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Yeah, I'm probably crazy."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Friend, this whole damned world is crazy. But you’re the one I’ve got right here and  now and I’m none to judge. I’ve…made my choices in life…” something dark seems to swim across Dieter’s eyes as he says this. There is a sadness there that Jaecob hadn’t marked before. </p><p>“Anyway, maybe you could do something with this here stumper. Perhaps those runes will come of use as we try to unwind the dread knot your father has tied us all into.”</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Hope so.  Not sure about everything down here, it seems like a whole new world.  Makes me wonder what he actually got hisself into.  Like, the agreement with the Yuan-ti to ressurect the Great World Serpent is one thing, but these guys...  that <i>thing</i> that was torn apart in the chamber...  Not sure what to do with all this information, eh?"</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Like this door.  These markings are totally foreign.  Do you recognize them?  Maybe from my father's crazy book?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter thinks back to the book, it's writing coherent at first, but then deteriorating to the scrawl of a madman. <i>Do I? Do I remember?</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The book that was found to help decipher the illithid writing.  Helped you guys get into the vault.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter searches his trusty bag for his book storage area and while rooting around finds a few flecks or rotten snake hide from so long ago. He smiles, nostalgically thinking about Vam and Heston, then turns his attention back to the matter at hand. He finds the tome and pulls it out, rereading and scanning for any passages that might speak of this.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Intelligence check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The writing around the door elude to something being needed to press to the rectangle on the door, some type of biological agent that is required to gain access to the secret within.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Do you suppose a Giant’s cock is squared like this?” Dieter half-jests to Jaecob, not one hundred percent sure he want to know the answer.</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Ya know, I dont think I ever want to find out the answer to that question, Dieter.  But if it's biology they want, don't we have some souvenirs from them?  If not, I know where we could get some..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter checks over his packs but comes up short. He then replies, “Where did you say we could get some?”</p>

<h3>Jaecob Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p>"Back at the vault.  I can run back.  What should I grab, though?"</p>

<h3>Lord Alezander Muhlen – Jaecob Muhlen</h3>
<p><i>"My remains are past this door.  If I remember right, they placed their slimy face tentacles on the block to get in.  Disgusting creatures.  Be wary, it feels as if there's still one lingering around me, even now..."</i></p>
