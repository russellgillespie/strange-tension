<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He rubs his hand on the back of his head and stutters.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes go a bit sharp and she takes a step backward, toward the main street.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I had a row with a friend.  And that song made me...  uncomfortable.  That's all.  A bad memory from my childhood.  Thank you for worrying.  I'm feeling much better now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to pry. I shouldn‚Äôt...‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúPlease excuse me.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns to leave.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wait!" she yells!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns back.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks back and forth down the back alley.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You're new to this city, yes?  And to the Feywilds as well?  There have been some very strange things happening lately, and I'm not sure if you're coming here is one or not.  Pardon my bluntness, but in my line of work, it's best to be open about what's at stake.  If you catch my meaning."  She looks down at her scuffed boots, shyly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúIndeed. Go on.‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The boat, the black ship the bard sang of?  It is docked at the wharf <i>right now</i>.  I've seen it.  It came in last night, late.  A few folk went to investigate, on a dare for the love of the gods...  but they never came back.  Some say the entire thing is empty, but it's huge.  Not a person has disembarked, either.  There's a legend that says 'first the ship comes back, then the god follows'.  And, frankly...  I'm scared to see what happens next."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúDark tidings abound of late. Thank you for your words of caution. I may have cause to investigate ere long. Would it be forward of me to call on you at your establishment? Could you keep an eye on the activity around that ship?‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She seems surprised.  This woman is unused to someone looking out for the greater good, so she's cautious.  At the same time, she nods and says, "Yes.  I'll keep an eye.  And you can call on me at the Oaken Grove.  I'm usually there in the evenings."  She steps closer.  "Thank you, stranger."  She smiles, then runs off down the alley to the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He watches her on down the alley, considering her words, then turns and slowly starts off to rejoin with the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage awaits at the end of the street, ready to ride.  Daran sits on the sidebar, smoking a pipe.  He waves when he sees you.  "Anything interesting?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúIn a minute...‚Äù He looks around a moment, then ushers into the carriage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hastily spills out his bowl and stows the pipe, hopping into the cab.  A snap and the horses move off.  Bellatrix smiles at Maouelue, then looks worried at his countenance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As soon as the clatter from the ride creates ample noise, he starts in with the others about the black ship and his encounter with Tinebrae.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman's eyes get large and she starts giggling, then cackling, then fully laughing outright, unnerving the others in the cart.  Bellatrix reaches out for her sister, "Honestly, Benna!  What's gotten into you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, the ghost ship a-comes!  The ghost ship a-comes!!  Hee hee!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue idly fondles a trio of platinum balls as he considers this, twirling them around in his left hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Driver, please take us South out of the city. We aim for Lanrion's Tower."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Padron me all, while I consider these tomes and scrolls. Feel free to pass them amongst yourselves along the way. We should steep ourselves in the lore of this place if we are to survive."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins by taking out the scrolls and copying them over to his spellbook excitedly. He would take some time to practice and prepare these when he could.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>Frost Fingers added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage driver salutes behind to Maouelue, cracks the whip, and the horses jaunt off at a high trot.  Bellatrix still gives you an odd, worried look, but then gets interested in the books offered.  Daran and Benna also sift through them, checking out what they are all about.  The trip to the south of the city, to Lanrion's Tower, starts in earnest.</p></div>
