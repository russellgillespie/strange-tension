<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter considers the voice. From whom had it come? Was (s)he young? Were...they?...what was this aural apparition?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gives a look of grave concern to Dieter that is all the answer needed. Dieter begins to answer back...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The chill deepens, you feel like an answer comes, but you just can't be sure.  The cold seems to be coming from the vault doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter seems compelled. Without consulting with his group, he tractors toward the vault. The others follow in defense of their enthralled companion.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thin tendrils of blue vapor course around the door.  They wend and weave their way into and out of the scratches and markings on the doors, eventually bringing to bear twenty sigils arranged symmetrically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter begins tracing them in fire, Maouelue shrugs and does the same on the opposite side in ice, trying to match Dieter’s timing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>They spell weave top down, out to in along the sigil lines. The flame and ice auras casting a pale light flickering between violet and green where the overlap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As your hand covers a rune, it glows a bright purple.  The fire and ice dont seem to affect it but your presence does, or at least your intent to 'activate' the runes.  When they are all lit, they give off a brilliant radiance, filling the foyer.  Then they slowly... fade to darkness.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>This time, the wizard picks up the words... "Runes.  Four.  House.  Clues."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue translates for Dieter and Briffo...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter turns to the entryway and up to the north room with the destroyed portrait ghost. He leads them to the West door and pushes on it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You enter the 'green' room.  (Perception check for what you think this room is.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks from the mage hand holding the bronze brazier to the green slime on the walls and floor.  He bends down to scrape some of the muck away and sees cedar wood flooring.  He does the same for the walls, and finds the same.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees this and he instructs the hand to continue wiping away areas of slime to reveal anything hiding underneath.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hand scours the room, unveiling a couple more bronze ewers.  But no sigils are here.  There are four doors, two on the N and two on the S.  The door to the W opens into the library. (They put a fucking sauna between an art gallery and a library?!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They proceed to the north  doors and peek through both.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one on the NW opens into damp, disgusting scraps of what used to be towels and linens.  The NE door opens onto various bottles and vials on shelves.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter never says “no” to a vial. He starts hovering them into his bag as he looks at the labels.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Mostly perfumes and soaps.  Some look a little volatile, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They leave it alone for the time being, head backward and to the west.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They move back through the house, through the prep kitchen and out through the east door then up to the north end of the hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall ends in a right turn, a door stands in front of the party.  It leads back to the main foyer.  Briffo scratches his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue has an idea. He runs through the house and distributes ghost crystals into the three sigil containers in numeral order.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>While his companion runs around like a mad wizard, Dieter inspects the scrolls in his bandolier.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out his water skin and dribbles a few drops ok the parchment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The few drops soak into the parchment, partially showing a sigil under the writing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter full saturates the paper, inspecting the sigil.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The full sigil appears, it is one of the runes you've been looking for.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He catches Maouelue’s attention as he passes by and shows it to him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both consider the circle of runes they had seen, trying to recall the message. Maouelue thinks through what he has put together so far.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“R<i>NEM</i>R</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he mutters, the group heads back into the prep kitchen and looks around some more.</i></p></div>
