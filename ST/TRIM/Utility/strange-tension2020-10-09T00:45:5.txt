I scoured it thoroughly, and I didn't see a chest of any sort.  Nor any minecart.  I think that might have been a casualty, too.  Again, many apologies lads."</p><p>The chest was made of thick wood with iron bands.  The minecart was made of wooden walls with metal bracing on the bottom and metal wheel parts.  Maouelue found a good amount of metal left after the fire.  No iron bands or wheel bits, though.  The silver ore was strewn over the floor and the coins were in a pile in a puddle of water.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye!  Safe travels.  Oh, and be wary of the Muhlen sisters.  They can be... trying."  He smiles and ushers you out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As they open the door to leave, they see Douglas coming down the road with the cart and they proceed with the loading of all their possessions. As they do, they ask Denson if they can pay him some silver for his troubles.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Many thanks, gentlemen."  He bows to you both.  "Anything I can do to help, please let me know."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group, eager to get on their way, pushes the cart quickly to the forge and seek Saynea to check on the status of their custom orders.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party makes their way to the smithee, minecart in tow.  The same steady hammering can be heard as before, however it has more pronounced notes.  Saynea is smoothing out some bits of Dieter's sword edge, forming the bevels and tempering it.  She looks up as the group comes in, and she smiles.</p><p>"Hoy there!  Glad you could stop by today!  Got some things to show you."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She takes the large silver spheres out, shows them to Maouelue for his inspection.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes them in hand and looks over the smooth silver orbs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows her head. "Thank you kindly!  Here is the mold, as promised.  Any time you need more, come on back in."</p><p>"And for you," she says to Dieter, "I'm almost finished with the sword end."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The totem will take a couple more days."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"If you'd like, leave your staff and I can finish it and affix it in a couple more hours?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She slowly nods, "Sure, and thank you for the trust.  I'll put this in the back room for safety."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group load out the rune coins and pack enough silver to be wise for the road. About 25 nuggets each.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, "I'll be here when you get back."  She twirls her hammer and starts back to working on your sword attachment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a nod, they move off down the road. Dieter, in a hushed voice, suggests that they head back to Trix. He tells them he would like to have her scry again using these strange parchments and coins as a focus.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieterâ€™s face begins to elongate strangely and his body begins to bend at the midriff, his proportions oddly shifting as his clothing and gear merge into his shifting skin. A moment later where he had stood, there is now a large black stallion. Who neighs and beckons Douglas and Maouelue towards his back in an apparent bid to get them to mount.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas takes a step back, eyes wide, stammering.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I knew you had magic, but..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye."  He'll go to pat Dieter Stallion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Never."  Standing in awe, he thinks for a moment, then says, "Are we really going back to the forest right now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter Stallion lets out a snort and kicks his hind hooves at the dirt.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas looks from the horse to the wizard, then back again.  "No, yeah.  Yeah, that's okay.  We can go, that's...  Yeah, that's okay.  Let's go!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gives him what he thinks is an understanding look.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both hop on, Douglas a bit gingerly and requiring a hand up, then Dieter Stallion accelerates to a canter and heads out of town towards the forest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you head out of town, farmers wave and double take at the stallion.  You pass the animals in the field again.  There are even a few farm-hands out this time.  As you get closer to the forest route, Dieter, having been through the trail before, picks up the track fairly easily.  There are a couple twists, but he remembers to look for the blood on the trees, and the arrows pointing the way.   A short time later, the group comes into view of the ramshackle homestead of Bellatrix.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just as Douglas hops down from the druid, and arrow flies by his head, narrowly missing piercing his skull.  It embeds itself in the tree just beyond him, and a rapid series of sticks breaking can be heard from where you all just passed by.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone whirls their heads around, looking for the source of the shot.</p><p>(Perception checks!)</p></div>
