strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The cell door to their immediate right is lined with several chests.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gives a muffled start and looks at where Frume is beckoning. He checks the door as if to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens...  (Sleight of hand check, let's see if it squeaks üòü)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes his time, knowing the two thugs are basically right behind them.  Ever so slowly, he checks the handle.  It comes open with no sound, no resistance.  He looks around and with the caution born of survival, and the patience born of being a child of nature, he opens the door enough to let both he and Frume in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are three chests in this cell, the first one is wide open, nothing of importance is inside.  The second and third are against the remaining walls, both are closed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúFrume, stay by the door for now and keep watch while I check these out.‚Äù, Dieter whispers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He makes his way over.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, draws his sword, and waits by the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first closed chest is unlocked and un-trapped.  There Dieter finds his clothes and incidentals.  The second chest is locked.  (Sleight of hand or strength to break it.  Or, if you have another idea...)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sizes up the chest and tests it‚Äôs weight.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tumbler gets caught.  Dieter tugs on the barb he's using and the lock <i>clicks</i> very audibly.  Luckily, or maybe not, at the same exact time, a bellow comes from the other room...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Who the FUCK took my cards!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter slips his ring of invisibility on quickly and feels a deep precious relief come over him. He raises a shushing finger to Frume as he does so and beckons him to stand back against the wall as out of sight as possible.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter vanishes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume smiles as he sees Dieter disappear.  He hides inside the cell.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Footsteps sound in the room, they're coming out of the West exit, heading right toward you.  As the men breach the hall, you see a lumbering, ugly brute with a heavily pock-marked face and baggy clothes trudge out in front of a weaselly looking guy that has missed a good number of meals.  He's gaunt and his eyes have a seriously haunted look.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter attempts to sneak by the brutes and create a distracting noise back in the card room by flapping the trap door and leaving a card next to it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The decptive, dissapearing Druid deftly dodges the daft dimwits detecting their direction. He slips out the cell gate and presses himself against the wall, having donned his Boots of Elvenkind, he is feeling particularly impish and fae. He tries to squeeze past the pursuers to make a distraction, hoping to prevent Frume's discovery.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big man feels something slip past him.  He says, "HEY!  Something's in this hallway!  Something just touched my arm!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Since you made the second check...)  The other man waves his hands around, checking the area around him.   Even though Dieter is <i>very</i> close to him, he says, "I don't feel anything!  You idiot, are you still eating those mushrooms?  I told you to stop eating those mushrooms, they're going to rot your brain!"  He pushes the big man from behind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter hurries over to make his mock escape down into the catacombs, loudly banging the trapdoor open and leaving a card "accidentally" on the ground next to it as he does so. He then backs into the corner near the W wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two hear the loud bang and rush to the spot.  They look at each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"They didn't."  They look incredulously at each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big bastard doesn't see the note, but the Weasel guy does.  He picks it up and looks at it...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bigger man goes down the trap door, the smaller man backtracks to the western hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door <i>thuds</i> close.  The small man sneaks into the hall.  He looks left.  He looks right...  into the eyes of Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter lunges up behind the man and puts him in a silencing chokehold.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume runs out and tries to stab the guy in the gut.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guy is amazed at the rush of violence and barely brings his sword up to block anything.  Eye wide, he swipes out at the both of you, trying to hit either. (1-Dieter, 2-Frume)</p></div>
