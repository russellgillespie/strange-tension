strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, we can traverse the mines.  Not much to them, really, this part at least.  This is a fairly new dig.  There is a much bigger one across the hills, still a part of the Krytos Hill system.  I was there for a little bit, bunch of Dwarves in charge over there.  Here it was every man for hisself.  There something in particular you wanting to see, friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three of you roll the cart through the East tunnel of the Krytos Hill mine, putting bits in that you think might be useful.  There are some smallish silver nuggets, shovels and pickaxes, various miner-related gear.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the cart is being wheeled out to the main cavern area, you notice the campfire has completely gone out, there is no smoke emanating from it.  The bedrolls are still there, bites have been taken out of it, rips and tears that indicate of animal habitation.  The morning sun is peeking through the entrance, slightly shrouded as it is still fairly early.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They beckon to Douglas to follow them into the first corridor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Three travellers move down the West tunnel, past the other bedrolls, and approach the steep staircase.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter slips down the last few stairs, but Maouelue and Douglas right him.  As you enter this further tunnel, you see the carnage from the day previous.  The smell hits you, then you notice the carrion scavengers around.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes a closer look at the scavengers trying to discern their species.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They're actually kind of a mixed breed.  Rats bred with some other type of vermin.  They're not currently hostile toward your party.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter communes with the scavengers, imploring them to reveal anything they have experienced recently that might indicate whether there are more mortals remains in the area.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, chastened by his earlier brazenness wants to try and determine whether these creatures might be able to alert them to any potential ambush points in and around the cave.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter doesn't get words, more pictures and feelings from the animals.  They send a lot of struggling with their fellows, scavenging for food and shelter where they can.  They can to this cave, drawn by the smell, only very recently.  They only know the layout of this room, and the garbage pile a few tunnels over.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They do not sense nor have they seen any other living creature in these tunnels.  They've seen a lot of dead ones, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter attempts to tell them that his party means them no harm and they are just here as ore scavengers. He then nods to his party to move over to the silver vein and begin mining.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rat-things go back to their feast.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group divvies up their assorted tools and being chipping furiously away at the ore vein. They all seem to feel a deserving lust for the shimmering metal, buoyed by their recent hardships.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group mines for 4 hours taking turns at the pickaxe and sifting through the rubble keying in on the choicest nugs available.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As their arms begin to tire a bit, they suggest a break for some rations and to gather their findings into the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Your group digs for some time, narrowly missing stepping on these strange creatures that always seem to be underfoot.  A few hours in, you stop for a break.  Just as you all start again, Douglas's pickaxe lands on something wooden.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Maouelue rush over, and Dieter immediately remembers that there was a strange crevice or depression in the rock wall that they meant to investigate.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all dig in this one spot, finally uncovering an old chest.  Decorated in gothic iron scrollwork, it reminds all of you of the classic pirates chest in stories of old.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a huge, gaudy lock on the front, banded into the wood by thick iron bands.  The thing weighs a ton.  It takes all three of you to pry it from the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter examines the lock looking at the shape of the keyhole/mechanism. He wonders who put this here and whether a means of opening this chest might lie in these halls.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the gothic markings, running them against his knowledge of ancient scripts.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torchlight plays off the rough clay/dirt walls eerily.  The iron and wood of the chest seem to drink it in, making the room dim.  A breeze wafts past the three of you, source- less, but no one notices.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue drools slightly as he falls into a stupor while considering the markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's pulse quickens...</i></p></div>
