<div class="character-0"><p>“The <i>Queen’s</i> fortress from what I can tell. Agh! Benna! Come, come with me and I will give aid!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes them both bodily and lunges back for the crystal!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The air compresses, the crushing begins...  (d100 please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crushing abates, the groups collective double vision clears and focuses on a sparsely furnished room with myriad backpacks and satchels on the floor, all around the place.  Stacked against a few walls are swords, shields, pikes, halberds, and general purpose weapons of war.  A few chests are thrown open, their contents picked through.  There are a couple that are still closed.  A wardrobe is in the NW corner of the room, it's door flung wide, it's contents of finery scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>There is a wide passageway into an empty room to the W.  Fine rugs and tapestries can be seen on the wall, illuminated by several ornate wall sconces.  A <i>scritch...  scritch</i>  can be heard from that room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue s founded the room for curatives and ammunition as he beckons Bella to settle Benna as best she can.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The armor clunks heavily as Maouelue pounds through the room, trying to find restoratives for his companions and other goodies.  Hundreds of pieces of ammunition (standard) lie about - arrows, bolts, and marble-sized ball bearings used in slings.  There is one healer's kit, a box of bandages and gauze with some ointment in a glass vial, and two standard potions of healing.  </p><p></p><p>Bellatrix notices another box of healer supplies and makes quick work of bandaging her sister.  Benna is stable, the blood has been staunched (for now), and Bellatrix rises and looks to Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>Unnoticed, until now, is a small, cloaked man - a young man, no more than 17 years old, elfin, hood down to show his close cropped blonde hair and surprised expression - looks upon the unfolding chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>"Wh...  wh....    who are you?  Hhhh..  Hh..  How did you gg..  get in hh..  here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue turns to the elf, “Shhhhh.... young one, there are forces stirring here that you would do well to flee. But, pray, tell me, just where is <i>here</i>? For we have come by, erm, rather unconventional means.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He takes a deep breath, glad not to be thrown into a fight.  </p><p></p><p>Meekly, eyes darting between Maouelue and the women, he says, "'Tis the Fortress of the Queen of Air and Darkness, lord knight.  The fighting began some time ago, and she has fled.  She bade me stay here and keep watch, and scribe the events of the battle.  I have been doing what I can, with her scrying beacons around the keep.  We are many leagues underground, I cannot understand how the Court's forces were able to find us here.  Have you come to stem the tide?  To push the enemy back, brave knight?"  He looks up, wide eyed and innocently pleading.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I am the Queen’s chosen and yes, young one, I have indeed come to stem the tide and lay low the enemy. The Queen’s teleportation magic is...a bit erratic at times, so I thank you for your service in our reorientation. So that I can complete the Queen’s mission, can you recount for me, quickly, what has transpired here this far?”</p></div>
