<div class="character-1"><p>The first few, nothing happens.   On the fourth, a small explosion lights up the table and the smell of ozone fills the air.  Frume smiles at Dieter.  "That's a winner!  Remember that one."  He continues.  Another does something similar.  Unfortunately, his enthusiasm reaches a bit too far.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He reaches a small red vial, the contents are thick and it looks almost like a solid mass instead of a liquid.  Frume drops the flaming bit of cloth into it.  Nothing happens for a second, two... three.   Then, the inside of the vial turns a bright orange, the vial balloons out...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The the contents implode.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume takes the brunt of it, while Dieter is able to jump behind the pile of bodies.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Oufffe! Also remember to <i>NOT</i> do that one again!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite!  Well.  No pain, no gain, right boyo!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, I'm no stranger to that one."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Just what did you put in that first one?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He is able to find the first beaker of putrescence and he sets it under the door.  "Just set it on fire, laddie!  I remember from some of my sailing days, we found some dead bodies on a beach.  Tried to burn them and several of them just <i>exploded</i>.  Figured there might be something here like that here.  If you would do the honors, let's stand back and toss the flame over!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right."</p><p>Dieter tosses the torch then ducks behind the pile.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vial goes up in a fiery explosion, the door goes up in flames immediately.  Smoke fills the room.  (Con save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter starts coughing, hard.  Frume pushes something into his hand.  He pulls up a kerchief and motions for you to do the same.  (Con save again, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(<i>muffled</i>) "You good to go?  Let's get it!"  Frume runs at the flaming door.  He hits the door with his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter follows, with a shake of the head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door comes down and Frume pats down his clothes, checking for fire.  "Fun, right?!"  He smiles widely at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall is short and it turns sharply to the right.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You know what?!? That <i>was</i> fucking fun!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter likes this bit of reckless indifference. It's an interesting change of pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ha!"  He thumps you on the shoulder, then heads to the break in the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The subsequent hallway goes north and south.  The light illuminates the whole length.  There's a dead-end to the N, to the S it takes a sharp turn E.  There, unfortunately, is a heavy stench of urine that is starting to be covered by the smoke stench.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I can't fucking breathe in here for much longer. Let's hurry!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter runs to the South corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another short hall.  A hall to the N, then another at the far end to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter scopes out both turns.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short hallway on the N ends in a locked door.  The door to the S button-hooks around to head W.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid dives on forward S and W.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall curves north and ends in a locked door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter doubles back to the other door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He checks the door for traps.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Door is locked.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door looks really sturdy, but doesn't appear to be trapped.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume, I've always wanted to kick down a door. You with me?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Let's do this, boyo!"</p><p>(Strength check with adv, or attack roll - if you have unarmed attack - with adv.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door buckles, shakes.  Dust rains down from the cavern hall ceiling and comes back at the two from the shaking door.  A crack sounds, but the door still stands strong in the doorway.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is moaning coming from beyond the door.  Sounds like a handful of entities, all groaning loudly and approaching.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Uhhh, on second though, maybe we try the other door?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, shaking his head at the door.  "Woulda been interesting if we knocked it down in one, eh?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye. Aye aye aye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Why do I get the feeling you're enjoying this?" <i>He winks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Could be me smile!" He smiles wide.  "Ahoy, lets see what else is gonna try and kill us down here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed. Maybe we listen a bit more closely <i>prior</i> to kicking this one in, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, then shakes his head, chuckling.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leans his ear up to the seam in the door.</p></div>
