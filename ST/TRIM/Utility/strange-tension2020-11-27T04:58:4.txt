He is nearly at a loss for what to try and make sense of first, when his mind turns sharply to Dieter. He spins around and tries to perceive the fleeing monstrosity.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue remember them going north, but nothing from that.  He can't see them at this time.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue quickly pours a potion down Frenchy's throat and brings him to consciousness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you both move to look over the remains...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight's body twitches.  Suddenly, he pulls his legs in, pushes slowly off the ground, and gets to his feet.  A blue light is emanating from a locket around his neck.  "You're going to have to do better than that, wizard."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight takes off his helm and throws it off to the side.  Maouelue sees another familiar face, although he has only seen it briefly.  The last he saw it, the man was unconscious and being hauled down a hole in the middle of Oakhurst.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad Dunnol, which you now know as Bazad Muhlen, stares down Maouelue, breathing heavily and tightening his grips on his swords.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It wasn't supposed to be like this!" he yells at the mage.  "You were supposed to join us!  You were supposed to help!  Instead you ruined everything."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well then, your sister trying to assassinate my friend was a bad start...Tell me, oh most pitiful of the Muhlens, what foul atrocities have you committed at the behest of your power hungry sisters? Why was there no mention of you in your Father’s vault? Just....<i>Dearest Daughters...</i>? Surely, you can see how they use you to meet their ends....Why not be an individual rather than a joined of doomed causes?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pitiful?" Maouelue can see the tears in his eyes, the trails on his face now.  "Maybe I am at that.  My father recognized only his daughters as heirs to his kingdom of knowledge.  For some reason, only they were invited to his inner circle.  It bothers me not, for they shared with me the fruits of their labors.  They let me know the dark heart of our dear, dead father.  And I would not wish my direst enemy to be aware of his inner thoughts.  To be welcomed by him was to be used by him.  His knowledge, though...  that's a different story.  You were the ones who had the key, he said you unlocked it.  You can bring about the end of all this.  If my sisters attacked you...  either you provoked them to do so.  Or the madness...  the madness has taken them completely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. They have been taken... And what of this madness? Will you not stand and break the cycle?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I have my orders.  I'm to bring you to the Runemark.  He knows you have the pieces to unlock father's mystery.  Culver said you went to the mines.  You can find the lost city.  You can bring them back.  You can bring them <i>all</i> back!  But he said your hearts are hard, and you would fight.  We were to bring you in any way possible."  He spins the blades.  "And I intend to."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes...of course...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Why didn’t I see it before?”</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“I am sorry my countrymen...”</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"GAH!" he gasps!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue grimaces deeply under his visor. Mimicking his double, his opposite, his shadow...he throws the Frostbitten Helm to the ground. His hands glow blue, his eyes prismatic as a blinding radiance seems to form around, shimmering in the bright plate, bow smattered with the blood and detritus of beast man and otherwise. A ray of frozen light shoots out of his hands and flies toward the lesser Muhlen!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Frenchy sees the wizard’s zealous strike lay the Black Knight low again, a light flickers in his eye. He runs to his fallen fighter friend and picks up the Mace of Reduction...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>...a fit of fury forms in the furrow of his French forehead. He drags the mace over to the Black Knight and begins smashing his face repeatedly with the mace!</p></div>
