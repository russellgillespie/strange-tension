strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas, knowing these guys might be after him next, eyes the door and bolts.  (Since there are a lot of bodies in here, I'm treating it as difficult terrain.  The tavern is roughly 60x40ft, the door, from the PCs, is roughly 40ft away.  Douglas can usually move 30, halved is 15, then with the dash is another 15.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas claws his way to the front, around flying haymakers and flying bodies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The far man, unwisely, brings out his scimitar, causing a panic in the area around him.  He swipes out at the wizard, catching his lower leg.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter channels his memory of the dune grass along the coast of his domain, it seeps up from the floor and grabs the man who flung the stool by the legs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man trying to grab Dieter suddenly sees strange costal grass growing rapidly from between the cracks in the floor.  He dodges out of the way, deftly, but, in doing so, ends up putting more distance between himself and the druid.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man then looks around.  Seeing he's not near Dieter, he dashes towards Douglas and is hot on his heels.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd is crazed, punches are being thrown, people are stampeding away from the crazy bloke with the sword.  It's utter insanity.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd surges, the pelts are coming left and right.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Douglas takes 3 points of damage, Dieter 1, Maouelue 6, and the Bad Guys...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... 16 points each, which means...)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You hear several burly men, farmers by the looks of them, call out, "Hey, the heroes need our help!  Everyone, let's get these arseholes!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd surges again, and then, things seem to calm.  The tavern takes a collective breath, everyone looking around.  Most of the patrons have scattered, save a group of gnarly farmers who don't take no shit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One of them, a man with leathery skin, tanned from decades in the sun, comes over dragging one of the men, unconscious, by the shirt collar.</p><p>"This the one giving you grief, lad?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ha, always!"  He goes around to his pack, pulls out some thick rope, and tosses it to you.  He kneels down, helping you hogtie the man.  The other one, with the scimitar, looks...  rough.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter has Frenchy and Douglas carry the bloodied man out the door and asks Frenchy to go to the Inn and remove the riches from the mine cart and bring it out to meet them in front of the Pig and Falcon.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I've had enough fun for one night, lads.  Name's Sy, I run the Broken Skull Ranch north side of town.  You need any help with these'ns or anything else, come on out and see us.  Else I'll see you in town." He dons his hat, tips it, and starts ambling northwards with a few other farmers and ranch-hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue begin to drag the Hog-tied man across town to Culver’s and ask Douglas to keep watch for Frenchy and the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They all let up a holler and wave goodbye as they all start ambling back to their homes.  The night is crisply cold.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas is passed out from exhaustion just outside the tavern door, slumped in the dust.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Maouelue, without really speaking to each other, get a funny feeling that something at the end of the fight was off...  Nothing specific, but you both know that something was off.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue helps Dieter get the man across the threshold and then without a word hastens off back toward the Inn.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he departs he can hear the beginnings of a fierce interrogation, Dieter’s voice resonating with a beast-like character.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue nears the Sleeping Sheep.  The commotion has died down, the Pig's doors are wide open, the barkeep cleaning up inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue approaches the Tavern he looks for Douglas and Frenchy.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard looks for his other two companions.  Douglas is still passed out in the dirt in front of the tavern.  Frenchy is just starting to come out of the inn with the minecart, still laden with riches.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you get closer, you can see Douglas, passed out, slumped against the side of the tavern.  The hog-tied man is nowhere in sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue attempts to wake Douglas and bring him into the tavern. He sees Frenchy out of the corner of his eye and gestures for him to follow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas slumps over further, a dark, wet red patch spreading over the bottom part of his dark tunic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's head drops as he lets out a low moan. Fearing what he will find, he lays the man down and inspects the man's apparent wound.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
