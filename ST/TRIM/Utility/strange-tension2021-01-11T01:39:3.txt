strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue looks up at the unfolding scene, desperation seems to mount with each passing second, yet a stout defense they would make. For a moment the sight of the giants, drenched in snow, reminds him of the vault back in Muhlen Manor. The first revelation of the frosty avatar of giant magic, the icy ambitions of the Lord himself. Here he stands clad in these garments. He dons the helmet that he laid out at the manor, draws out his frozen sword and sends out any icy beam from the tip of the sword, straight at the hexed giant!</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her first beam hits expertly, but then her dark powers begin to tilt and she send her fel beams wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Nevertheless, she regains her feet with a Blood Witch Dance and sends the hexed creature walking away from Daran, West into the third Giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blood witch's voice gets inside the disgusting giant's mind.  Not only does he move toward his compatriot, he attacks him!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Bellatrixâ€™s dance comes to an end, she seems to come back to her more reclusive self for a moment, overwhelmed by her own display of power.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The third giant strikes down with it's greatclub, making a dent in it's cohort.  As it fells it's friend, it blinks, not quite knowing what has happened.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Bella hears the weeping heartstrings coming from her Northeast but does not look to see the source. Instead she rounds on her new prey.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The dark dance begins again, the sight of the descending giant bringing Bella's blood back to a boil.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She twists its feeble mind, whispering its will away after a willo-the-wisp in the wavering woods.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the fetid creature lurches away, she strikes out hard with her blade in hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She draws in her breath, feeding on the rush of necrotic blood searing out of the staggered mass. Blast after blast sears in a sickly red-black-green beam toward the failing giant's back.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As her last beam gets away from her, she spits black liquid into the fey soil, sneering canines now poking out of her furious face.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She dashes off to the Northeast, tucking behind a tall tree.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maoulue begins to make a series of movements in a flash as the giant slams his club into the tree behind which Bellatrix is hiding. He taps his amulet against his shield, a faint glimmer transferring to it in the process. Maouelue seems to swell with vigor as this happens, then he dashes forward at the lumbering giant. He stows his frosty blue sword and pulls out a deadly mace, bringing it down hard at the creature.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The off-weighted mage misses spectacularly, his delusions of parchment grandeur apparently getting the better of him in the Feywild.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her indulgent distraction shows as her dark beam seems almost thinned out by her levity....or was it something else?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She comes back to her senses, a different kind of blood boiling in her face now.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her last beam pierces through the gap in the giants loins, just below a painful potential.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flustered now, she hastily tries to send the infuriating thing into the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It drives straight into the tree, wondering only after why the hell it's doing so.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix flees back now, the hem of her robes brushing Maouelue slightly as she passes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran drives his swords down into the giant's back, trying to sever something, anything.</p></div>
