strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"Which ones?!  There seemed to be thugs every time I turned my head!"  He shrugs, good-naturedly.  "The ones in the lady's mirror, I couldn't tell much.  Only know the moustache man vaguely.  Saw the big man at The Pig last night, he had his goons with him.  I recognize them, but I'm not high up enough on any ladder to know names," he chuckles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There's a lot of people that work for the big man; some that live in town, some that don't.  Either way, seems like he's working for someone, too.  Could be more than one person, but the talk I've heard is that Moustache is the boss.  Nothing gets done without his okay."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I see...let us take care then not to draw attention to ourselves and our mission...though...I suppose I should avoid free ales for a while...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter lowers his head in a show of mild embarrassment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah...  I never got one of those last night!  Too busy...," he starts patting his pockets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Dieter, you didn't happen to see..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You didn't happen to see a piece of parchment paper, big spot of ink on it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I can’t say I have, not unless, well...there was a piece next to you on the table, but...it burned. We...there...was this circle of runes...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter trails off as his eyes cloud over slightly and his complexion darkens a shade.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It burned?  Hmm.  Strange.  And the runes, are they like the ones on the coin I showed you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Coin?...wait...<i>in the mine!</i> I knew I had seen their like...  what do they mean? You mentioned you were searching for them. “</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah, that's the reason some of us were there.  Besides the ore veins.  The big man came up to me one night in the Pig, asked me if I had found any of those coins.  Laid down five gold, said, 'There's more where that came from, bring me more of these coins when you find them,' and that was it.  I have no idea what they are or what they mean.  I don't read runes, and I didn't ask the big man.  He's not an 'answering questions' type, anyways, know what I mean?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter frowns gravely</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dark deeds, runic circles, mystical convergence...we must be wary. Fel things await those who delve too deep into the magical unknowns of this world.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He reflects on something.  "Huh...  I would think those would be the thugs that had Culver, but we saw him with Moustache..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter considers this for a moment, his gaze is drawn to a glimmer of blue-white light streaking toward him from down the lane. As it draws nearer, its form becomes clearer. It appears to be a sort of fey fox. It sprints directly to him and holds its mouth slightly agape. He appears to be offering a small scroll held in his trap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peers curiously at the beautiful, unearthly creature and slowly reaches for the roll. As he stretches it out, a second piece of paper falls to the ground. He stoops to pick it up and sees the message “...bring your net...”. With a furtive glance over at Douglas, he quickly reads Maouelue’s message on the larger roll. His gaze lingers on the paper for a beat, then he turns to address Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Douglas, ill tidings from Maouelue at The Sleeping Sheep. Pray, hasten to your rooms and gather what you need then rejoin us at the inn.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Will do, meet you there." He dashes away toward his lodgings.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks at a steady pace toward the inn until Douglas is out of view, then he turns and sprints instead to Culver’s shoppe.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he approaches the building, he casts a few furtive glances around, wishing to avoid the watch of any passers by.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks around, believing he has been unseen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He enters the building and locks the door behind him. Seeing the scene of destruction again in the morning light kindles his inner rage once more. With a steely grimace, he makes his way to the back room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he enters, he surveys the scene, he is keen to determine whether anyone has disturbed his...secret.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter scans the scene.  Everything looks the same as you left it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves over to where the armoire had been and reaches out, feeling for the cords of his net.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... he grips them...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls the net back and folds it up, then straps it on the underside of his pack. He lets out an ice-cold breath through pursed lips, then pulls the wardrobe doors ajar.</i></p></div>
