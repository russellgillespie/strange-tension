strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"You say craven, I say... business.  This is nothing from the Council.  We're very much looking to speak with you both later."  Her eyes are still closed, but she is smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Check your pocket before you spit your venom, or repeat my words back to me."  Eyes still shut, still smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, without letting his eyes leave Veena, pulls out the ink splotched parchment from his pocket.</i></p><p>“You mean this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She opens an eye.  Then both.  Smiles back at you, then winks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Have something in your eye? Just <i>what</i> about this carnage and evil is quite so funny to you?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The fact that you think you can get information from me.  The fact that, even though you're holding that, you have no idea what it means.  The fact that I got caught by amateurs and you didn't kill me outright.  There's <i>plenty</i> to find humorous."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh the latter can be arranged wench...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out his scimitar and holds it to her throat.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix cries out, "No, you musn't!  There are horrible consequences if she loses her life by either of you now."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She hestiates.  "I might have an alternate option."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks shocked at the accusation.  Then visibly composes herself, although with an effort.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm used to having people distrust me. I understand.  What oath could I give you that you could trust?  I've already helped you with potions.  I could swear something in magic, if you would like?  If either of you are able to do something to that effect?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands her the parchment and a runed coin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue regards the scent with intense apprehension and caution, searching for any tell of deceit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix takes the items, looking forlornly at Dieter.  "I will help you in this.  We need to finish with Veena, first.  After we decide on what to do with her, we can make time for another scry.  I will only be able to do one more today.  May I ask, are these yours or no?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Faintly, in Maouelue's mind, he hears, <i>"There is much to magic.  Life and death are inexorably linked.  I appreciate them both equally."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue involuntarily mutters under his breath, “Yes...balance in all things...equal measure...a perfect node of truth in between...”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter proceeds to search her for any boot daggers or hidden vials and the like.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No boot daggers (that would have been cool, though!  C'mon Joe, write a better villain...), the bandolier is off of her, along with all of her equipment.  Didn't get her leather armor off, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter scowls.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Bind her while we regain our strength. I will take her to the council myself. I would have you come with us...so willing.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh... I...  can.  If you prefer."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. I will risk no more surprise. Maouelue, come, let us recover an hour and consider what we have seen.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will pack some things.  However, I do travel light.  Let me step inside.  We require Douglas to remain... uninterred, correct?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He will be sealed inside the thorn wall, but the carrion birds...  They will have access.  If we hurry, it should be fine.  I will make haste."   She picks up her skirts and runs to her home.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix returns with a small pack, using a staff to guide her steps.  The staff is gnarled, twisted, the top is a mess of brambles, nettles, and thorns curving in on itself to form an imperfect spheroid.  "All set.  I've set wards on my home.  Give me a moment to do the same for Douglas's resting place, and I will create the Forcecage for Veena.  Then we will away."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She waves her hands toward the wall of thorns, a shimmering like a heat haze settles on the structure.  Next she turns to Veena.  Her irises turn a milky white, she points her fingers at the woman.  A darkly wavering set of ethereal walls appear around the prone woman, her vine bonds drop away.  She stands and puts out a tentative hand to the dark magic wall.  She recoils as if bitten and looks darkly at the other woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"She will not be able to leave."</p></div>
