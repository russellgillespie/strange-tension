strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The two stealthy blokes enter in the rear of The Pig and Falcon silently, surprising the bulbous cook.</p><p>"Oy, you two!  Give a man a heart attack!  Can't you see I'm working me arse off here!  I don't need surprises, too.  Get outta here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods to the cook and quickly heads to the busy main room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Not one to shy away from an adoring crowd, Dieter shows them his "drink two beers at once" trick.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter... tries to do his trick, but these mugs are covered in a heavy lacquer and laden in grease.  One slips, then the other.  Most of the ale covers you, some of it douses the bear in a gout of sputtering smoke.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd goes quiet for a second.  Then a GIANT roar goes up, Dieter's back is slapped, and <i>three</i> more ales are set on the table for you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another big cheer, and a mead in a large mug is set up in front of you.  One of the farmers calls for news of the minecart you rode in on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas scans the area for his contact...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... and sees an obese man in clothes a lot finer than what you've seen in this town so far. He slowly makes his way over.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He then regales them with a bit of an exaggerated recount of their latest encounters.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter keeps the majority of the crowd in rapt attention.  Some are being kicked out due to drinking too much, making a bit of noise to contend with you.  But the greatest number is rapt, listening to your tales.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stumbles in his speech a bit and lets out a giant belch, rubbing his stomach thereafter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas taps the big man on the shoulder and whispers something in his ear.  The man, without looking at Douglas, pulls a piece of parchment out of his vest and hands it to Douglas.  Douglas looks at Maouelue, surprised and somewhat worried.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue flicks his eyes meaningfully toward the loos.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, stumbling a bit more now, seeks an open seat near the hearth.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, suddenly realizing he is famished, tries to catch the barkeep's eye.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas takes the nod, sees where Maouelue is directing, and heads there.  You catch him give the big man a backwards glance.  The man never looks at Douglas. (Perception check for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue has been clocking the big man's eye movements.  He seems to be watching Dieter very closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard and Douglas approach the loos.  Douglas pulls out the parchment, which is folded several times over.  He unfolds and looks at it, puzzled.  He shows it to Maouelue.  (History check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is a dark blotch of ink in the middle of the page.  Nothing else, no writing.  Searching his memory, there is something there, something relating to the sea maybe?  The wizard can't quite put his finger on it, though.  Not precisely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Meanwhile, Dieter, ever presentational, makes a show of ordering what seems to be enough food to feed 3 men, going on about how he hasn't had a bite in near a day and a half.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods.</p><p>The bartender, a harried man with sparse, flyaway brown hair and a sweaty complexion, nods as Dieter orders.  His eyes go wider and wider with each additional item.  He tries to interject a few times, but Dieter goes right through with his food order.  The people at the bar take notice and start cheering the druid on!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue whispers a few words to Frenchy and hand him the 5 silver coins he is carrying. The henchman circumnavigates the crowd over to Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy shows the silver pieces to the barkeep.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bartender, completely flabbergasted, calls to the cook the giant order, and says its to go.  The cook comes to the window and says, "WHO THE HELL ORDERED ALL THIS FOOD -- TO GO?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cook looks through the partition, sees it's Dieter talking and says, "Oh.  It's you.  Okay, but it's gonna take some time.  Gimme a minute."  And he trails off, going back to the kitchen.  The crowd cheers again.  Someone pulls out a handmade lute, a couple drums come out, and a flute-like instrument is produced as well.  Music and merrymaking begin at The Pig.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, picks his head up and is shaken to see a flaming bear in front of him. Realizing the increasingly dangerous nature of manipulating an open flame around so many people, he ends his conjuration and stifles a few large belches.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy steps back into a nearby corner and observes the bar as surrogate bodyguard for his summoner.</i></p></div>
