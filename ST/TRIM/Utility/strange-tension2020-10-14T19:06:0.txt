<div class="character-0"><p>"Where might someone concoct such filth? With what reagents?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue studies the rings with arcane intent.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"First ring there is poison resistance, second one, like the one I have on here, is a ring of protection.  Last one...  Again, I'm at a loss.  Looks pretty beat up.  Don't really remember where I came across it.  Haven't the heart to get rid of it, and no one seems to want to buy it."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter picks up the scratched gold ring, looking at it more closely.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is, looks in very bad shape.  Maouelue points to the rod, and the halfling smiles widely.  "Let me show you!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He picks it up, says, "Stand back a bit."  Then he points the wand in the air and <i>whoosh</i> an string of fire darts straight up into the sky.  It climbs, climbs, climbs...  When it's almost out of sight, and looks like it might have fizzled out, the wizard and druid let out the breath they were holding.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then...  <i>BOOM</i> the sky is lit up by a dazzling fireworks display!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A myriad of colors pop and fizz and explode, to the delighted clapping of Briffo.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The rod of Sky Explosions!  Might need some work on the title.  But the results speak for themselves!  Played a show once where someone set these off while I was playing.  Very good time, I can tell you."  He smiles, reminiscing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halfling is a <i>whirl</i> of emotions.  He was very enthusiastic to play, starting to take out his shawm, but slowly puts it away, nodding that it might be better to conclude business.  His face is extremely malleable, and he wears his emotions right out front!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Positively, good men, I couldn't agree more.  What... ah... What exactly are we going to that house for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Do you have any experience in...the art of altercation Briffo?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, I've been in a scrap once or thrice, but, if I'm hearing you correctly...  Nothing of that like, no..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gestures to the Light Crossbow slung across his Clydesdale and the shortswords laid out amongst the tradegoods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halfling looks from you two to the weapons to the horses, then back to you.  He steels himself and says, "I've been on the sidelines for far too long.  Why not, eh?!  Time to <i>make</i> some stories, not just tell of them!  I'm with ye, lads!  Er...  whoever ye are!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group spends some time divvying up equipment. Dieter hands over the crossbow and poison shortswords. He dons the elven boots and hands the robe over to Maouelue to do the same. He picks up the bandolier and considers it, then looks at Briffo.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>While Dieter asks this, Maouelue picks up the RoSE and turns the three rings over in his other hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I might be persuaded...  If the fiend was foul enough!"</p></div>
