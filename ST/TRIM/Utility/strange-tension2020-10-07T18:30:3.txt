Although it seems to die down a bit, the flames are still going.  A cheer goes up, and the brigade resumes tossing heaps of water.  Looks like they might have it quenched in a few minutes... or possibly with another spell?</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A blue light begins emitting from the wizard's hands.  A yell goes up, the crowd disburses back to give you room.  A flash, then a rime of ice layers and crawls its way through the room, completely quenching the rest of the fire...  All save a pile of coins, which look to be glowing red hot in the middle of a puddle of water.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue heads into the smouldering wreckage and beckons Kirra to follow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Denson meets both you and Kirra as you enter the burned out section of the Sheep.  </p><p>"I'm sorry about this, Master Wizard.  I was hoping to catch you myself, but the fire hastened faster than I thought it would.  Had to organize the brigade as soon as I could."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shakes his head.  "Looks like a good deal of damage.  Was there anything expensive left in your rooms, goodsir?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I'm glad of that, too.  I have to be off, need to talk with the town elders, see about repairing the damage as soon as we can.  Please let Kirra know if you need anything, or happen to find out what caused it all."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It would seem that our presence here hath brought some form of wealth through our efforts out at the mine..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"However, it is also clear that, whether it was here prior or not, we have also drawn out foul actors and in turn share some responsibility for the fate of the town and its people..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"With good faith, I would use this silver to settle our debts and grievances with the good merchants and proprietors and do one better..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We met a young boy in the street yesterday...He said to us, <i>We take care of our own here, m'lord.</i>..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I would like to bind our services to the protection of the town and form a guild of minutemen to both secure the town and patrol the surrounding lands, mines, and resources..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I fear the darkness that grows in the mountains and forests, and would use my every power to prevent its spread."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray, relay this to the elders, for we must not delay if we are to follow Culver's fate to the heart of this darkness."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at you, stunned.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah...  Aye, aye goodman Wizard.  I'll be sure to relay your interests to the Council.  They would be very happy to hear of your interest to protect the town."  He bows low to you.  "Mell met, kind sir.  Kirra, please let me know if these men need anything."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And with that, he turns and hastens away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The milling crowd lets out a tired but heartening, "Huzzah," and quickly goes back to their respective daily grinds.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Kirra says to Maouelue, "You have quite a way with words, Master Wizard.  And we very much appreciate what you've said you'll do for the town.  If you pardon my asking, why do you think an evil has beset Oakhurst?  We're not much to speak of."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh...  My, okay.  Let me see..."  She steps gingerly into the wreckage of your former room, taking care not to step on anything smoking or water-logged.  She squats on her haunches when she gets near to the pile of now dimly glowing coins.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There's something written on these.  On all of them. But I... I can't quite...  No.  I can't make it out at all.  Looks to be some other language.  Are these your coins?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue summons a fey arctic fox, takes out a book, pen, and ink from his backpack, then quickly scrawls a message relaying these events to Dieter, bidding him to join them in the drawing room of The Sleeping Sheep as soon as possible. He tears the page out and quickly rolls it up, then places it in the fox's trap. He then touches a glowing blue spot in the middle of its forehead with his thumb and forefinger, telepathically directing the fey creature to bring this at once to Dieter at the parsonage of Ilmater.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sits in ritual to produce a fox companion.  As he does so, Kirra searches The Sheep as well as surrounding shops for a metal container for the coins.  She comes back to the wizard disheartened and empty handed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I could find no metal box that would work for what you want.  There is a metal coffer Kentham owns, it is too small for this amount, though."</p></div>
