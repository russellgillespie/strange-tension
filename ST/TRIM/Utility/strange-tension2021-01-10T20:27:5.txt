strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s mind races back too all the books he ever read on the Eldarin, frantically trying to think of something that would save them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He searches Daran pleadingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran holds his hands out. "Please accept our deepest apologies.  My name is Daran Edermath, son of Yanoros Edermath, of the Imperios Ralohorn bloodline.  I am a Horizon Walker, one of the called protectors of Myth Evereska.  These here are under my safeguard.  We are traversing the Feywild in hopes to defeat a newly arrived doom to Faerun.  There is much need for us to make haste through your realm, I apologize sincerely for the intrusion."</p><p>(Did Mao want to add anything?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>For once, Maouleue is speechless.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elves look between each other, then size up the group again.  The lead elf raises his arm, moves it slightly behind him.  They say, "Cruiver, Otirnis, lower your bows."  Without any of them taking their eyes off you, their weapons are lowered.  </p><p>"Hear this, Master Protector of Myth Evereska, you are not welcome here.  This not your home.  Maybe the other one with you could stay if he truly wanted.  But know this - even though you have the capability of coming here, you have neither the authority or welcome to be in Faerie.  We will walk you to the closest crossing.  There you must leave our lands."  The lead two turn to move further into the forest, the other two are waiting for you to pass to take up the rear.  Daran looks sadly at Maouelue.  Softly, he says, "Sorry Maouelue.  Not the best reception for your first visit here."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Errrm, ah well met ancient brethren. I pray not be too presumptuous and I fully understand your desire to defend your lands. But we are here to quell a darkness that may yet reach its unrest into your domain. Surely your lord would hear fair warning! Let not old prejudices cast aside the cords of reason! Come, see our cause is just. I swear it by the star of my Master Shi’Vandos.”</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The leader stops abruptly.  His companions do as well, the rear guard at attention.  The bows are drawn but not up.  The leader turns their head so that their voice can be heard behind them.  "I understand your need.  Both of our worlds have troubles, 'doom' to use a phrase.  It is not foreign to us.  I am sure you would have us lead you to your way point.  You may even want to petition one of our noble houses, or one of the Queens even.  However, any of these actions would be folly.  You are outsiders, as we would be in your world.  We know how outsiders are treated in your Faerun.  I believe we are treating you much to the positive by allowing you to return to your home.  Do you disagree, cousin elf?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tension is offset somewhat by the beautiful atmosphere.  Each of the pale elves, however, is a taut bundle of muscle and wariness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's impetuous outburst is quelled. He opens his mouth to speak in retort, but words and courage fail him in light of this rebuke. All he can muster is, "And so it goes." He cows his head and treads on in captivity, saddened slightly at the difference between fancy and reality.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader nods, starts back to walking.  The octet moves N, away from their target.  Daran looks beaten, the women look worried.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud <i>crack</i> sounds from the forest path in front of the group.  The leader puts their fist up to halt everyone.  No one makes a sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Hand signals move back and forth between the elves.  The rear guard moves forward on the path, bows drawn and aimed ahead of them.  Towards the sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A series of loud grunts issue forth from the glade just ahead, which is obscured by the trees as well as a small rise in the forest floor.  Daran whispers to himself, but Maouelue can catch it.  "Good place for an ambush..."</p></div>
