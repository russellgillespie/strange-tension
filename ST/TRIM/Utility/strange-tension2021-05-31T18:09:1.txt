<div class="character-1"><p>As the behemoth gets blasted by the green energy beams from Bellatrix, it falls with a roar and a <i>thud</i>.  In the quickening quiet, Maouelue can now hear voices shouting to the N of their fighting.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As the trio make their way through the area, they keep hearing echoing voices, urgent and wary.  The fighting has called people - the question is, who?  The group makes its way out of the small passageway connecting the contoured stone block rooms to an open cave system surrounding the structure.  Just to the right of them, as they ease out into this new area, a wooden pen can be seen.  Within, a monstrous creature with an orange-amber carapace, a long tail with a viscous looking barb on the end of it, six spindly legs, and two massive clawed arms jutting from it's front.  It is using the claws to hack at the wooden beams of the pen, looking for a way out.  Farther into the cavern, more yeth hounds can be heard, yipping.  </p><p></p><p>Around the corner, movement...  Then...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An arrow comes out of the area just beyond the pen, arcing at Maouelue!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue moves forward and brings his hands together, a rime of frost forming on his hands. He shouts out, "How cool is cool?!?" The rime then seems to dissolve from his hands, creeping around the bow arm of the attacking archer.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Looking at the foul arrow in her arm, Bellatrix winces, but holds firm. </p><p>"Oh, playing with missiles are we?.." She winks at Mao as the red of her armor begins to pulsate. The blood around her wound congeals weaving with dark black rivulets of magical force running to her fingertips and blasting outward in three short sharp shocks toward the perpetrator of her pain.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's fingertips glow again, but this time with a twinge of iridescent purple. His fingernails seem to grow out of the very tips of his gauntlets before four sleek bolts fly out and dart right at what seems to be a gate on the northwest side of the paddock, right next to the Unseelie! They ping one after another into the clasp...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The clasp and part of the gate and paddock <i>explode</i> inward, shards of metal and splinters of wood careen all around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A shard catches one of the unseelie eladrin under his armor, and he yells out in pain.  The monster in the cage doesn't seem to notice his freedom has been granted... yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After the barrage of bolts, a small, bluish orb seems to trail like a comet in the wake, beaming toward the second archer.</p></div>
