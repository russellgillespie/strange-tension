strange-tension*Dieter heads back to where their Muhlen sisters had first spotted them and tries to secure a length of rope to assist in managing the climb.*

Dieter has a harder time getting to the place where the beast was.  The minions didnt have anything on them, but the boss might.  As he approaches the entrance, he sees it littered with rubble.  The entrance has collapsed.  (You might need the others help.)
*He gives a big groan as he makes his way back over to the rope.*
“Haaaay you guyyyyyyyss!!!”
“Come help me over here! Back down the hole!”
*He waits a few moments for a reply.*
You hear Frume making his way to you after a time.  "Whassa matter, Dieter?"
*I think we were hasty in one of the previous chambers. I need to ask your assistance. Come down.*
"On it."  He heads to where you are.
When he sees it he sighs heavily.  Then, taking your meaning, he looks down his arm...
"Ah,  I don't know how much help I'm gonna be here, lad."
*Maouelue has tagged along and offers to help.*






The three haul rocks for a good few hours, finally revealing the wreck of the hallway and room the snake-man-warrior was killed in.  Most everything in here is covered in a think layer of soot.
*Dieter pokes amongst the remains, looking over the warrior's corpse for anything that might have survived the blaze.*
*Maouelue heads over to the alcove he didn't properly appreciate before. Was there something there?*
Dieter sees ashes and soot.  Every coffin, every clay statue, the bones of the monster they faced-off with...  ashes and soot.
Maouelue finds another idol, this one bronze.  Same design as the gold one.  There is a crack in the base of this statue, and it's drawer hangs lopsided inside.
*Maouelue attempts to use his sword to wedge the drawer open.*
With a *pop* it tumbles out of the base, completely off it's track.  Inside is an object wrapped in a piece of parchment.
*The wizard gently unwraps the parchment trying not to touch the object yet.*
*My dearest daughters, I had hoped you would follow in my footsteps.  Know that this path is dangerous and rife with peril.  However, once you choose it, I promise you it will not be without glorious rewards.  Find the other two statues, learn what I have to give you.  Once this is complete, find the iron door.  Use this key to start your new lives under a new banner.  May the Great Scaled One rise and live forever! -LM*
*The wizard pockets the key and mutters...*
"So. Close. Now."
*The group heads back to the rope, but considers the passageways underneath the route above for a moment. It had all happened so fast, first the ceiling, then the boosting and teleporting up. Had they missed something below?*


The wizard is fairly confident that, although these caves are probably vast and they would be able to search a very long time and find many interesting things, things pertaining to their current quarry are above, not below.
*It's at times like these that Dieter is glad he brings a cool head along.*
*The group attempts to ascend the rope.*
*They assist the one-handed Frume up, then Dieter helps with the metal mage's ascent, then he attempts to clamber up afterward.*
Something seems different in this room to you all... (Perception checks, please!)


The stench of acid is still strong here but the clothes are in the wrong place.  Maouelue remembers going through them, as does Dieter.  They both agree that someone else has been through them recently.
*Dieter goes invisible again and moves out toward the front of the group. They start back around to where they stoned the basilisks and inspect the far end of the room.* (r20)
The hallway before the group is narrow and the torchlight flickers off it menacingly.  The ceiling is ridged like the gullet of a snake.  (Perception check)

There are multiple passageways off of the hallway.  The room to the right has discarded and rotten tapestries moldering way on the floor.  Two open rooms are on the left side of the wall.  At the end of the hall, two snake-men statues stand guard over a vestibule area and a hallway that travels NE.

This hallway is trapped, something about those ridges.  Dieter can't say exactly, but those ridges don't look safe.

*The wizard looks in and nods.*
*The Druid inspects the area for any triggers.*
*They peer into the space on the left before the triggers.*
The first room on the left has rotted pillows on the floor surrounding three large stone eggs.  Tapestries that might have hung on the walls are in tatters on the ground.
*Maouelue takes special interest in the eggs, feeling them over with his ungloved hand.*

Maouelue taps into the arcane, sensing magic within the eggs.  They are made of rough stone, but carved well without any cracks or pockmarks on the surface.  There does seem to be a thin red, sticky coating on the tops of all three.  Maouelue smells the substance.  Blood.
*Dieter is getting a bit weary of fanatical burning at this point, but he’s to tired to bother arguing. He sets a small flame at the base of the eggs.*
Nothing happens as it's lit on fire.
