strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Still jabbering, the thing tries to bite out at Jaecob.  Missing very badly, one of the mouths spits something caustic at Dieter.  Before it hits him, it explodes into light, like a firecracker, blinding Dieter, who is very close to that pit...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli, dismayed at seeing her new person take what she knows to be a devastating effect to the face schlurps over and steadies him lovingly with her tentacles.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli flails out spasmodically, the voices in her head rising to a fever pitch.  She moves, trying to will them away.  In her frustration, she lashes out at Jaecob, knocking into him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It bubbles up goo at Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob pulls back with a ferociously furious face full of reckless rage. He unleashes a series of blows into the heart of the spewing pile.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Slightly less stupid than he thought for a fleeting moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gloop wends around Jaecob's attacks, several of the mouths give him hell for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The young draconic flayer purrs a soft, deadly note. The eyes, and mouths, and tentacles all lock on to the ooze, then seem to contract as one.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco lets out an ear shattering screech of frustration.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It warbles through the tentacles.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes in a deep breath and gathers his mental faculties.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He feels perfectly collected and in tune with the growing sense of acceptance of his role as the thin grey line between the two sides of light and dark.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>He spits on the beast then slinks back down onto the wall, and gasping.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bubbling pile of ooze is now bits and blobs around the room.  The effects of it's various voices and blinding spittle recede.  The room becomes quiet.  Silent as the grave.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[3,100 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco is having a jolly old romp of excitement between the two, making all sorts of squelching flapping noises. Shelli, hearing a thrum of revelry, takes a tentative peek out of her shell, which rapidly accelerates, well...as rapidly as a Flail Snail can....into a bobbing lurch that can only be interpreted as ecstasy.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Somewhere in the back of Dieter's mind, he could swear he hears a horn fanfare....</i></p><p><i>...It's probably nothing...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Reeling in the crew, Dieter calls for calm, then directs everyone over to the pit. They all look down at the darkness. Dieter brings over what remains of the flaming sphere and lets it fall down the hole, watching as its light illuminates all it passes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shadows are cast as the sphere shrinks slightly, passes by the group, and heads down the hole in the middle of the room.  Immediately, the crew sees flotsam of the creature clinging to the sides all the way down.  The sphere travels thirty feet, forty feet, it still continues on.  The sides farther down seem less disgusting, and Dieter and Jaecob can almost make out flagstones.  The sphere continues down, down, it becomes a pinpoint of light no longer under the control of Dieter.  There is stays, but the group is unsure whether it is at the bottom, or just disconnected from the druid.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, the flame <i>winks</i> out.</p></div>
