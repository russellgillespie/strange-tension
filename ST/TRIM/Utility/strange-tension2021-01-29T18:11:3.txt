strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>She looks confused, angry yet elated, and horror-stricken, all at the same time.  Maouelue's comany (and all of the other soldiers, for that matter) have never seen her anything more or less than placid.  This is an extreme reaction, and she's not really trying to hold anything back, either.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She's breathing heavy and says, "You?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks up into her eyes, not knowing, but intuiting the depths at which his presence, his heritage, the timing of his coming, could upset the balance here of all places. His curiosity forms as careworn crow's feet in the corners of his eyes, his spritely vigor letting down its illusion to show the meticulous, resourceful, yet confused child-grown. The thirst for the answer to all the riddles of his lineage now written in the lines on his face, begging for the answer.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Shi'Vandos is my father. I...did not know it until late; not long ago as a matter of fact did I learn of my history. I aim not to bring this old rift to your doorstep, and thus have focused on the matters at hand...but now, I see there is no avoiding it. Please...I am at your service...but I need to know...who I truly am."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She straightens, shakily.  One of her aides brings her a chair, just in time as she collapses as soon as she gets fully upright.  All manner of people are both around her for support, and avoiding the kneeling man on the floor, as if he were diseased and highly contagious.  The Queen whispers something to a soldier to her left, and he bolts away, without a second look back.  The atmosphere is tense... strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She takes another deep breath.  From a conflicted countenance, she begins.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There once was a noble family, they were not a part of the Court but they yearned to be.  There are both times and methods we have in place to admit such families into our fold.  Of which, this family took part and was eventually accepted as a full noble blood member of the Summer Court.  They hid, however, a dark secret, one which destroyed not only their standing within our hallowed halls, but created a rift so large they were all banished to other realms for eternity, never again being allowed to set foot in the Feywild.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yet, my husband, a kind and generous man, did not guarantee their banishment by completing the ritual that would keep them out.  He, in kindness, though that future generations might be able to make amends.  He banished only the culprits, but not the kin.  There is a saying that the children pay for the sins of their fathers.  In this case...  well... that may as yet be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Have you heard tell of the dragonmarks?  Or the prophecy of the Dragon, Maouelue?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I have seen and read many things relating to the dragons, but this point eludes me. Please, enlighten me." </p><p></p><p>He continues to kneel, head lowered in deference.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And what do you know of other realms, planes?  Eberron?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Is this, truly, the only other plane you've visited besides your own?"  An anger starts rising in the Queen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Only whispers, allusions, references..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Answer me true, Maouelue the Dragon Mage, what do you intend to do after the victorious raid?  Take my throne?  Steal the Court?  Destroy the Feywild?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I ask for your trust, for demand it I cannot. As a royal, I know not whether you can understand the pain of being a pawn in your own life, though forgive my presumptuousness. My past, as my future, continue to reveal themselves to me in tandem...a dual helix of timelines traveling in reverse. The great circle traversed in both directions."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I seek above all to serve the causes of life."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He draws a sigil of Bahamut in the air, his triple-triumvirate now spinning around the platinum-blue ice trails hovering within.</p></div>
