strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll to be frank, I've been looking to cover up this spot tween my boots and plate. I have a particular proclivity for platinum, a penchant if you will. I am also keen to know whether you work with any enchanters in this city. I have heard of the wonders of Faerie and have some coin."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"OOh, aye.  We can do all o'that for ye, no worries friend.  Ye need some platinum greaves....  I'm almost done with this 'ere."   He starts rummaging around in his bins and crates of materials.  Finding three full platinum bars, he brings them over and says, "This whatcha lookin' for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well," he lowers his voice a bit, "Between you and me I need summat that will help me keep my head when my lust gets up in battle. I'm afraid this gap in my coverings begins to crave more than that of the wind....But I. Must. Remain. Vigilant. Yes, something to keep both my strength and my head in order." Maouelue looks around for a moment. "Might could you fashion a dragonscale pattern with this here platinum? Know you of any who might bestow them with this balance of power and intelligent restraint?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He scratches his bare chin and ponders.  Snaps and burbles come from the forge as smoke rises and plays at the ceiling tiling.  "Okay, here's wha ye do.  Yer gonna make yer way to the south part of the island, ya?  Once you get outta the city proper, you'll see Lanrion's Tower.  Somma th'shops here'll sell ya potions or whatnot.  Lanrion's the one to go to if'n ye wanna go big, aye?  Did ye want the armor 'fore ye go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes, perfect. Thank you for the guidance. What need you for the work? I’ve got a bit of coins and trade as you see.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, so ye 'ave!  Great to see!  These big boy's are 50 gold each, base price.  The work'll be another 100 gold.  I can get these done in two days for 250 gold.  If'n tha works for you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Fairest deal this side of the veil.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out his hand to shake on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They shake, the blacksmith says, "Name's Tovakis, by the way.  Lemme know if 'ere's anything else we can do for ye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Maouleue. Pleasure to meet you. Only other thing is to point me to the wizardry around here. I am curious about the local lores and magic of this place and would be keen to see any arcane tomes and scrolls that might be on offer.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Scrolls and tomes yer gonna want either the palace library or Mezomes Tomes, just a few doors down 'ere," and he points you down the street.  "Sfar as wizards are concerned, best places fer that'd be Spellbound, The Elder Marker, or The Lonely Elf.  All of them are in the East part of the city.  The first two are on the main road, the last is right near the city gates.  Can't miss 'em."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Many thanks friend. I’ll be back around in two days to take a look at things. Fare ye well.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue accepts the previous offer on his goods and then proceeds to Mezomes Tomes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran is sitting outside the tri-shop, looking over his new group of arrows.  He looks up, ready to get going.  Maouelue moves down the road to a smaller shop, tucked away in a cul-de-sac of walkways.  It is demure, simple, un-decorated.  Shelves of parchment and leather-bound books abound.  A booking elf with a pair of spectacles perched on the end of her long, slender nose looks up as the pair come in.  In a soft, feathery voice, she says, "Hello?!  How can I help you today?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh hello madam! I am a scholar of the arcane arts. I’m looking for a few spell scrolls to bolster my collection! And I wouldn’t say no to a tome of local lore!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks surprised, then it turns to elation as she scurried out from behind the back of her counter to meet with you.  You can see now that her hair, normally well kept for most eladrin, is a bit scraggly. The spectacles make her amber eyes look three times as big as they should.  She's wearing very plain clothing, but strangely has a traveler's leather vest with many pockets on the front.  She fairly skips over to the duo, making little squeaking noises.  The five cats in the shop look up in curiosity.   A black cat comes over and weaves through Maouelue's legs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The lore of the Fey lands?  Really?!  Oh, I'm so excited, that's what I am <i>most</i> passionate about here.  Is there an area of expertise you're focused on, or the city itself?"  She looks very expectantly at both men.</p></div>
