strange-tensionAs Frume is getting closer to Maouelue, he starts to ask if anyone needs help...  And a bear erupts from absolutely nowhere and charges the lizard-person!  Taken aback, not wanting to shoot *at* the bear, he aims for the fallen lizard-person.

He looks at the crossbow in astonishment.
*Maouelue walks up to the first snake creature and raises a haled blade...*

*Upon striking the beast dead with a flash of steel, the Dragon Mage begins to dissolve into a silvery mist. A faint shimmering sound as he reappears in front of the fleeing serpent. A cold shake of the frostbitten helm denies the snake its passage.*



The serpent sneers at the *heavily* armored man.  It tries to shove you in and shut the door!

The snake-man makes to leap over you...

Frume and Dieter see the door shut as the snake-person pushes a monolithic Maouelue backwards into the hall.

At the last second, the Dragon Mage brings his blade up.  The serpent snags its leg on the blade, causing it to fall into the wizard.  The two sprawl in the entryway of the passage.
*Beater beats and scratches at the __closed__ door with his claws and full weight, roaring for his friend.*
Frume is going to remove his head wrapping, showing a thick, scraggly plume of brown hair.  He lights a torch and peers at the door.  It looks like a solid piece of stone, there are no seams.  If you hadn't seen the two enter through it, you would have believed it to be an out-of-place piece of stone.
"Dammit!  They're in there!  One of those damned things said something and it opened.  How are we gonna get in there?  We gotta help your friend!"
Both Mao and the serpent come to at the same moment, looking at each other, lying on the cold stone floor.
*Maouelue pulls at his blade...*

*His arm hangs against a stray whip of the snake's tail and he is put off.*
The beast is heaving, breathing *hard*.  It looks like it's hanging on by a thread.  It throws it's head back and makes that same raptor-like call, keeping an eye on you the whole time.
It steels itself to fight!


It's lost too much blood.  As it lazily swipes the air, Maouelue can see the fight go out of it's eyes.  It knows it's fate is sealed now.
*Maouelue looks back at it, a resolute sadness in his eye. There was just too much evil to be allowed to remain in these foul snakes. Yet, he never relished the killing.*
*He begins to raise a hand...*
*Beater sniffs at the door, trying to see if it reveals the two beyond, perhaps this is some sort of illusion...could their scent pass through stone? How else could the barrier arise so?*

The bear smells, smells...  the tinge of blood tickle his nose.  It's spicy, with an algae-like tang.  It reeks, but it doesn't give the bear more insight into how to get past the door.

*Dieter begins to try speaking in snakelike tongues to implore the door to open.*
Dieter stares at the snakes.  Nothing happens.

Dieter remembers words and phrases in the language of the snake.  He parses some together, using correct diction and phrasing and...

Dieter sees a well lit hallway made of the same stone as the door; finely crafted and finished stones.  Torches are inset in wall sconces, their low light seems like the sun in this darkened expanse.  You see Maouelue and the snake-person still locked in combat.
*Dieter looks at the scene and sees Maouelue taking the situation in hand. The druid defers.*
Frume shields his eyes from the sudden light source, and yells in, "Oy?  You okay in there?"
*Maoulue raises an icy hand to the serpent's eyes, then sends out a ray or icy energy to finally quell the evil.*

"Resssst in peaccce"
*Maouleue mutters a prayer to the befouled earth, pulls the serpent's eyelids closed, and rises to look back at his companions.*

The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.  (History checks for symbol, perception checks for the hallway.)




The group can't quite lock on to the history of the symbol.  Dieter recalls it belonging to an ancient race of serpents, but the specifics are eluding him.  Maouelue has been in this hall for some time, and he has been soaking up the details.  The torches, oddly, seem recently lit.  There are two doors on the right, two doors on the left, and a large, oaken door at the end of the hall 35 feet away.  The oaken door has a strange looking handle on it.  The ceiling is carved and there are wood beams running lengthwise along the passage.  The doorways on the far end of the two on the right and left sides are bigger and their arches are more ornate.
*The group takes the money and amulets, but leaves the weapons on the bodies. Maouelue places a silver piece in each of the eight eyes before leaving. They move one door at a time, starting on the first of the left set. The mage tries the handle...*
The door opens with a creak.  It pulls open to reveal a small room with a wooden coffin in the middle.  There are no decorations or furnishings other than the coffin.
