strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>As the Dragon Mage steps up into the loft, he sees Heston sitting on a small stool next to an old chest.  Vam follows over and says, "Hes says it's an old family heirloom.  Haven't seen any heirloom like this, though.  What do you make of it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston holds out a shaped, twisted piece of metal.  Long cylinders connect and protrude from a steel body.  The end curves down into a handle of sorts, on which some sort of bone or horn has been layered.  Heston says, "Was my pa's.  Only ever seen him use it once.  He gave me the name of a guy that can help fix it, if I ever needed it, but he's way out in the North territories.  Never ha much use for it.  Until now, that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed this is an interesting trinket."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He undoes a clasp, and a wide cylinder ops out.  It spins easily, showing chambers around the main cylinder.  Six, exactly.  "Pa taught me how to keep it oiled.  It sends these things whizzing like you wouldn't believe!"  He holds out rounded, tube-like projectiles, similar to elongated versions of Maouelue's frosted balls.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Think it'll help?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Keep that thing steady there lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out for one of the projectiles, "...er, may I?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston readily hands Maouelue all of the items.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue inspects the cylindrical item and the elongated metal items. He chuckles mildly, thinking of the look on Dieter's face the first time he saw the new metal-clad zealous look. A mixture of dumbstruck horror and awe and confusion all grappling with the sense of camaraderie. The muscular contortions on the already shape-shifted visage were such as pleasant plethora of hilarity.</p><p></p><p>Here, holding this new metal monstrosity in his hands, he feels a pang of guilt holding the item and so sets it down carefully. He turns a professional eye to it instead, taking in its design and metalworkings.</p><p></p><p>"Was this everything in that chest there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Just some family memories.  Clothes and mementos.  But I thought I could carry that, in case it might come in handy.  Hate to be unarmed, and I'm really no good with swords or bows," says Heston.  Vam chuckles, starts down the ladder.  "Well, as long as we're getting things together, I think I'll run by the iron works, see what's salvageable."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You take good care of that weapon Heston, and if you need company up North some day, I'll see it done."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage lays a warm hand on Heston's right shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The lord of life and light guide your aim freind."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston looks up at the wizard, beaming.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now, tell me, whatever came of the <i>rest</i> of those serpentine reagents we gave you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Was there enough left over for the pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I do so desperately want to to deliver them to dieter and don't dare disappoint."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston guffaws as only a cowboy can.  "Sure, absolutely!  Forgot all about them in the commotion.  See here," and he takes you down the ladder into a corner of the barn set up as a makeshift tannery.  They are all as you requested, all fit to size.  They're extremely supple, too.  The craftsmanship is really top notch.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah perfect, Dieter'll love these. He's been jealous of my hat, armor, and bracers since the vault to be honest..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Won't say nothin' about it mind, but I see him sneaking glances."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But...I might just keep the hat..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston says, "Now, here's something I though would be handy."  He shows off the bracers, saying, "There's a small area here for a dagger or small knife, but when there's nothing in there, because of the scales, it's seamless."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, indeed! My man Dieter will find that <i>most</i> intriguing, if I've been following his passions precisely of late!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you for the beautiful work. We set up a bit of a forge ourselves down under as a matter of fact. If we get out the other side of this, might be we should make a bit of a go at it, after we learn a bit more up in the Northern reaches that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He pats your shoulder.  "If we get through what's next, just might hold you to that."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage returns a wry smile and a few crow's feet crinkle in the corner of his starry eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Alright now, let's round up the crew and hit the road. What say we ready a few steeds for our needs?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'll get right on that.  Four gonna work?"</p></div>
