Eyes close again and he says, "I've was tracking a group of orcs that attacked a village about a tenday ago.  The village guards put up a fight, but they were really no match for the lot.  I was just coming back to my village from an excursion abroad when I found the people decimated."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I tracked the bastards down, started picking them off one by one.  You should have seen them, they didn't know what the fuck was happening!"  He laughs, joylessly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Eventually they came into this cave system, I've been slowly taking them down e'er since.  Take a souvenir with every one, too."  Shows you some patches of what you can only guess is orc hide.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Haven't decided what to make yet.  Maybe I'll just use 'em to wipe me arse, eh?!"  He laughs again.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue quaffs another potion.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  I should probably be on my way as well, boyos.  Can't imagine what state the homestead is with me being gone so long."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I wouldn't mind the company up, much appreciated sirs."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party heads back down the hall and turns at the previous corridor, seeking out its last unexplored nooks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party enters the warrens again, the tatters and bowl of grease were left as before.  There is a exit from this room to the E and to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take the left way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sight that greets the three men is one that will stick with them for some time.  A crude throne is set up in the NE corner of the rectangular room.  On it sits a humanoid made of dirt, dung, bits of roots from the walls and floor, and any old thing that happened to be scavenged or lying around.  It stinks here due to this shit idol, but also because...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seven fungal goblins are praising it in the mire in front of the throne.  What makes them fungal goblins, the adventurers may ask?  Simply put, there is any and all sorts of fungal varieties adorning each and every one.  Some are even phosphorescent, giving a few of the goblins a odd glow to their skin.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>They do not pay you any attention at the moment, they're too busy humming and worshipping their idol.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He raises the Rod of Sky fire and lets off a charge directly into the center of the scene.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The effect is...  as you would imagine.  The burst does...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Six damage to each of the fungal goblins killing...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Three of them on the spot, and causing all of them to run in every direction, panicking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group draws ranged arms and begins hurling and firing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sets his sword and shield aside, going back to his frosty roots a bit and charging an orb. Dieter preps his boomerang.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Of the four that are left standing, two run directly at you, two run to the farther end of the room where you see an exit to the S.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They unleash on the grotesque scene.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Like a scene from Apocalypse Now, the goblins explode around the room.  Entrails, fungus, and green/black blood/sludge coat every surface of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take aim at the fleeing goblins.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You <i>destroy</i> all of the goblins.  And the shit idol.  And the throne.  And...  yep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries to find any remains of the phosphorescent fungus.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stands like a sentinel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sees one neon blue mushroom cap, growing off a decapatated goblin.  Its slowly losing its glow.  (Sleight of hand check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you're harvesting the mushroom, you slip on the brain goo and slice it clean off.  It loses its glow, but you can still take it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They step over the fallen fleeing foes to the passageway and move forward.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The passage south opens into a 10x30 room with...  a <i>very</i> obese fungus goblin, wallowing in a mud pit.  At least you hope it's mud.  By the smell, it probably isn't.  There is a ten foot neon purple mushroom growing from this bulbous goblins head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stays the hand of his friend whose rage is rapidly building. He calls out to the being...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Glorgig.  Glem bleh flerg baash."  His speech is very lethargic; sounds dribble from the sides of his mouth.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two heroes both speaking in Giant at the same time, taking their best chance, then laughing briefly about having the same idea. It almost feels like before...for a moment...then Maouelue catches himself and lets Dieter continue.</i></p></div>
