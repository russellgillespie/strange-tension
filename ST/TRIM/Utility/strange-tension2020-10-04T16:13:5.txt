strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The slings are sturdy but unremarkable.  The net, you now notice, is expertly made.  What is normally a gold piece at a regular city shop, and is typically made of rough rope, this...  Fine leather strands mixed with hempen rope twine is interweaved with multihued gossamer thread the likes of which you've never heard of before.  It catches the light at strange angles, and you realize you can partially see through sections.  (Anyone proficient in arcana can make an check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is a net of invisibility.  The gossamer threads, upon closer inspection, are strands of the old woman's hair.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group departs the shoppe and makes haste toward the forest mentioned by the shopkeep. Dieter mumbles something about hoping his henchmen are faring well in their protection of their goods before heading out of town.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue hands Dieter a sling and the net, hanging on to his own and pulling out his new longsword for closet inspection. As they wander toward the forest, they keep an eye out for any appropriately-sized stones for their slings. Dieter has a particular interest in getting stones.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's getting on dusk now, and the village is still congregating at The Pig and Falcon.  Avoiding their gazes for the time being, the three adventurers move on NE (after getting basic directions from Kentham) in the directions of the forest.  Dieter finds 20 stones suitable to his liking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands 10 stones to Maouelue</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>Deleted counter stones.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The farmlands pass to thick dales of grasslands, several animals graze at their leisure.  In sort order a copse of trees comes into view.  Beyond that, much larger and darker trees take over the skyline and the forest proper starts.  An eerie feeling comes over the group as rain clouds, travelling towards the party, appear over the trees.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note of what kinds of animals are grazing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group hurries toward the forest in hope of avoiding the rainfall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few cows and sheep.  (Perception for more, if you want.  Who is leading, or are they going side-by-side?  Douglas is behind everyone, we'll say.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group has now fallen into their standard formation with Dieter in the lead flanked by their two companions right behind and Maouelue bringing up the rearguard.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cows and sheep have a brand, BSR.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A murder of crows can be seen high on the branches of the trees as the group enters the forest.  There is a piece of bark nailed to the first tree.  Dirt obscures the words scrawled on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue spies the unusual signage and moves over to brush off the dirt to uncover its markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The message is in common.  <i>Stay on the path</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all can now see other writing on the barks of the trees, some scrawled, some written in a dark substance.  (Percep check)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue starts feeling queasy.  Dieiter gets right up to one of the scrawls.  <i>Turn back</i></p><p>Another, written in blood. <i>She lives this way</i></p><p>There are arrows in red pointing the way deeper into the trees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group, senses heightened at this unsettling script, moves forward keeping eyes out for both Trixâ€™s domicile and anything that might be lurking in the woods.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pull out a torch and hand it to the...hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With an eye for the dramatic, the duo perform an unnecessarily magical lighting and carrying of the torch.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They each side-eye their companions in search of signs of reverence.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas stares, open-mouthed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Frenchman always looks at Dieter with reverence.  The display does increase it, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Grinning slightly the pair lead on further into the newly lit woods.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The others peer tentatively around them, the flames now creating eerie parallactic shadows as they pass through the trees.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter says this, a crack of lightning breaks.  The forest is illuminated for a brief second and several screeches are heard from over heard.  A moment later, thunder rumbles.  A darkness settles over the forest with only the torchlight for guidance.  For the moment...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>There is nothing to do at this moment but carry on for the troupe. Their pace  naturally quickens in response to the ominous...omen.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the mage hand leading the way (and Douglas in almost darkness), the troupe follows the bloody arrows further in, towards 'Trix' and the incoming storm.  (Another Survival for everyone.)</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter whirls around, checking the trees again.  He rolls his eyes, then continues down the <i>correct</i> path.</p></div>
