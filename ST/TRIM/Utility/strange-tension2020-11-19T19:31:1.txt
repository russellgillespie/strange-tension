Several minutes pass as the other animals seem riled by something, they flutter upwards rapidly and perch, suspended from the ceiling, tens of feet above.  A small rumble can be heard, very faintly, to the N, and from below.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's new bat familiar returns and reports.  The cavern is extremely vast, the opening is 180ft above.  It is an entrance gouged into what seems to Maouelue as a barrow of sorts.  Ruined stone walls surround an altar or pedestal.  The room appeared to be unused for quite some time as the bat reports detritus all over.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note of the rumble and takes a cursory peek at the source of the sound.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat does not see any safe way down.  There are ledges and areas cut away from and into the rocks, naturally as far as it can tell, where the two would be able to stand and walk safely.  Getting to those spots could be treacherous.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is.  Sounds big, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two start heading back toward the forge.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue understands the bat's disdain, but...that's what familiars are for to an extent...He'd give it a spectral spider as a snack a bit later...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tugs at Maouelue's arm as they walk back toward the forge.</i></p><p>"I've got a plan...It's crazy...but it's a plan...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the two return to their construction, Dieter tells Maouelue about his plan and what they might want to prepare for the way. The wizard shakes his head and lets out a chortle of impressed, and a bit flabbergasted, approval.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>...dear how long had it been...? The time seemed endless in these halls with only the light from the forge and what they provided giving note. Thus the two would venture over to and from the crevasse to note the timing of the light from above, the better to track their days with.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Somehow they had come through it all unscathed, mostly, and the manual labor and reminiscence was working wonders for their camaraderie. Maouelue spent more time out of his shell lately as it was just too unwieldy and hot to wear heavy plate at the forge. Dieter was still making peace with his fraught relationship with metal. He supposed that since the lava's heat was of the earth rather than of burning woods, he was more willing to indulge.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And indulge he did. They did. They hammered away at that gold and platinum attempting all manner of tricks. Maouelue told stories about ancient folded-metal blades he had read about in the archives, while Dieter regaled the elf about water shapeshifters he knew who could cleave a shield with a thin-but-powerful stream of water. It was great to slow down and spend some time together.</i></p></div>
