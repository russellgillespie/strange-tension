<div class="character-1"><p>"It will be done."  She gives a small bow, turns to the group of seelie eladrin streaming in.  Finding someone, she calls to them, brings them over and says, "Illafaera will assist you with your arcane needs.  She is has been instrumental in taking the keep back.  If you need any more aid, please don't hesitate to have a runner come find me.  It is good to see you both."  She gives a small smile, then jogs south, shouting more commands.</p><p></p><p>Standing demurely in front of the pair is a tall, willowy summer eladrin, bright gold skin shimmering in the pale light of the underground castle.  Her long blonde hair hangs loose, all the way down to her waist, but it is as thin and wispy as spider silk.  Her large golden eyes look upon Maouelue with a mix of wonder, awe, and resignation - the Dragon Mage is having a tough time reading her emotion.  She waits, swaying slightly, her white-gray robes wafting in an light breeze.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your radiance..." Maouelue says as he bows perhaps a little too grandiosely for Bellatrix's liking. She interjects with a poorly disguised cough of annoyance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If you would, we have found one of the great chardalyn crystals that the Queen's champions have been using. I would have you investigate its arcana. Perhaps it could be of use to our cause..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows her head, letting her lead you to the crystal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short walk, just past the creepy dog, the group meets around the chardalyn, which a few other eladrin have found as well.  All stare in awe at the massive crystal jutting from the center of the floor.  (Investigation, perception, and arcana checks, please!  Arcana with advantage, because of Illafaera.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"It seems there are...  spells locked into this crystal," the blonde eladrin says, turning her over-large golden eyes upon Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the wizard takes his time to investigate the crystal, he notices a few very curious things.  First, it nearly mimics the one in the Pale Prince's throne room...  almost exactly.  Almost as if they were the same piece.  The floor does look torn away at the base of the object, and it does look as if the crystal was growing from beneath the keep itself.  There has been several protection charms cast on the chadralyn, mainly to bolster it's flimsy character.  A piece this large, though, could be very hale.  With the charms, it might be indestructible.  </p><p></p><p>There are several spells stored inside - teleportation, transmutation, communication, even a few divination spells.  There is one, however, which is strange.  As Maouelue peers deeper and deeper into the shard, he notices a light inside of it, beating as if it were a heart.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Two of the soldier eladrin, who seem to be taken in a trance-like state, reach out to touch the shard.  A small, soft voice flits in and out of Maouelue's consciousness, saying, "Touch the crystal.  It will give you powers beyond your wildest dreams..."   Maouelue notices several others turning to one another, apparently hearing the voice as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"STAY YOUR HANDS!!! HEED NOT THIS SUCCUBUS' TREACHERY!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The soliders break out of their trance and stare at Maouelue, then each other, blankly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Surely it could only be her...though there was this hag..." He takes a moment to recount his combat with the crone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Fascinating.  And she just...  disappeared?  Where could she have gone?  And what are we to do with this...   chardalyn, did you call it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Is there aught we can do to break the barriers? Have any of you any Dispel Magicks?"</p></div>
