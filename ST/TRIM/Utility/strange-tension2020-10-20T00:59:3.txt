Both are immeasurably happy.  (I'll get you a full inventory list in one sec...  Oh, and CON save, for both, please.  Disadvantage for Dieter.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The cold comes back with a vengeance.  Immediately, the frost is back, you can see your breath again.  Dieter's head snaps back, his eyes roll back in his head.  He stands...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And screams!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When his lungs are completely drained of air, he sucks in a deep breath; lugubriously, wheezing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You.  Live.  Well.  Done."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I.  Tried.  Help."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Truly.  Sorry.  Friend."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He. Is. Here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He. Is. Well."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The voice is coming from Dieter.  His eyes roll back this time, more gently.  Less...  frighteningly.  </p><p>"Sorry. Important. Message."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Will. You. Save. Us?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Name. Tabatha. Muhlen."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tries to wrest Dieter’s attention back and start their preparations to leave, packing up the fallen halfling’s horde and setting his body down.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid's eyes return to normal.  The cold abates.  You can feel the spirits watching you, watching what you'll do next.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter hoists Briffo’s body up onto his shoulder and picks up his boomerang. He fits the Ring of Invisibility into his jacket pocket and heads out to the front door in large sweeping strides. Maouelue follows, sorting out a few of Briffo’s knickknacks as he tries to keep pace. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is now producing small flames here and there setting a char on fire now a curtain now a rotting canvas. He has a carnal fury about him and his inner rage roils to an inferno. He unleashes every ounce of agony blistering every artifice he can find as he strides the group out to the entryway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunder rolls as the group leaves the house.  Small fires turn to big fires.  The group are about a hundred feet away when a crack of lightening hits the house full bore.  The rest of the second floor collapses.  The fires expand and the former beautiful mansion burns unabated.  Suspiciously, the rain has stopped.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue hands Dieter the Rod of Sky Fire. Dieter obliges and points it straight at the conflagration. He waits for a moment, watching the flames rise, then fires off one blast directly at what used to be the front door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The firework adds to the spectacle of the burning house.  A fitting tribute to the bard.  </p><p>Looking around now, you...  can't find the horses...</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group heads back toward the resting spot at the edge of the river where they met Briffo. They lay down their things and make a small camp, then Dieter begins digging at the ground with his staff, outlining a grave site. Maouelue collects stones and Dieter imbues each of them with magic as they make a small mausoleum for their friend. He had been together with them for only such a short time, yet made such an impression. They would lay him to rest here and seek out the smiling young lady halfling to inform her of these foul tidings.</i></p></div>
