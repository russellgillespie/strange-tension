<div class="character-1"><p>The two men, looking around at the immediate chaos, see a few more doors in the room, aside from the lowered drawbridge - one to the W, one to the NE, the last to the SE.  When Dieter spies the door leading SE, Alezander Muhlen's breath is felt on the back of his neck.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Startled and a little grossed out, the Druid whips around to face the foul source.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing is there save for the two barghests.  However, you get the indication he wants you to go that route.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You've got to be kidding me..." Dieter mutters as he stares longingly at the light then back at the door, then back at the light again. "Damn you Muhlen..."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter grunts and mutters, “Here goes nothing.” He pulls a red vial from his pack and rolls it back toward his friends. “Here, take this! Cover me!” and with that, he dashed right into the draw between the two Bhargests pulling out his totemic bladestaff and beginning to sing a song of a lad that is gone.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, seeing his friend’s battle cry, raises his voice to the frenzy, “Oooooooooo-ooo-o-o-oooooooooo!” He comes flying in with blade drawn.

<div class="character-0"><p>“Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!!!” Screams Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The snail, doing a double take a Jaecob’s errant strikes, slimes up to the first beast and lashes out with a tentacular flurry.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Completely confused, probably trying to grasp what creature is in front of it - is it a dragon?  An octopus?  A squidling?  What the hell is it?! - the barghest blinks and the fighting continues!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter runs to the door, throws it open, and sees a room filled with books and experiments, laboratory equipment and rows upon rows of items meant for magical use.

<div class="character-1"><p>The door can be locked once everyone is inside, there are three deadbolts.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They all make a mad dash for the door taking advantage of the Barghests’ confusion. Flayco, Jaecob, and Dieter all make the space in a few leaps then they turn back to see Shelli slowly moping across the floor. </p><p>“Come on girl!” Dieter cries.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli dashes in reply. Never before had a snail been seen to slime so smoothly.</p></div>
