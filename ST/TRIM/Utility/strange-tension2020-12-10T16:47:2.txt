strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods to you, looking determined.  He climbs the ladder, each rung clasp echoing raspingly in the clay room.  As he gets to the hatch, he whispers down to Dieter, "There's a catch here, I'm going to slide it quiet and try to peek through."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Without any sounds, even to Dieter, Frume undoes the clasp and opens the hatch.  Then, quicker than a snake bite, he clambers up through the opening and opens the trapdoor completely.  He offers you a hand.  "We gotta be quick about this.  No one's here but there's bound to be someone soon.  Les go!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter follows quickly, astounded at the silent lightning that is his companion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two enter in a roughly 30x30ft room, cluttered with desks and parchment.  A table is pushed into a corner, where four chairs surround it, a card game interrupted lay on it's top.  No one is in the room, but you both can hear sounds of talking coming from down a hallway to the <s>N</s>  South.  You both come up into what is essentially the center of the room.  (I don't really have this up in Roll20, did you want a board or is theatre of the mind okay?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room also has a hallway going off to the W.   There are no sounds coming from that direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They seem pretty garbled.  Unlike the underground rooms, these up here are all made of fitted stone, and poorly kept, so the echoes are furious.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think one of 'em is saying something about a lost prisoner...  Shite.  I think we make a run for it, but we need to be stealthy."  He looks around the room.  "Where in the bloody blazes did they put that trunk?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter examines the parchment and takes the playing cards for himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is looking for names, places, plans.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They're a deck of Three Dragon Ante, a very popular game in Faerun.  The parchment are various edicts and dictates about the law and how the questioning of prisoners should go.   Several are signed, they all look relatively official.  They've been strewn about the room, though, as if they're been gone over for information.  (Investigation if you want more info.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to perceive who is signing off on these papers and who might be the authorities involved, as well as whether the Runemark are for or against whomever has signed these.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The papers look old, and it's almost as if they've been magically protected against age, too.  The dates on some of them are outrageous, nowhere near where Dieter knows the date to be.  (Dieter sees the year 3129 on them, with a strange month tag that he doesn't recognize.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is nothing within the papers that he recognizes as belonging to the Runemark.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes 3 of the more interesting looking ones and begins to usher Frume out of the room quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They move West out of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the duo heads out of the room, moving down the westward corridor, the sounds of talking start getting louder from the northern passage.  The two exit just as a pair of voices enter the room behind them.  (Stealth checks, with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oughta get hazard pay for this shit, can't believe they're having us mount to look for these assholes.  They're probably still in the fucking castle.  I say, take every floor, search every room.  But no, no one listens to me."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oy, aren't you the one that said they're probably in the catacombs?  You're fulla horseshit!  I think Rock is right, they're way off'a the grounds.  Someone helped 'em escape, probably someone close to that Bander guy, and they're making a run for it.  Gonna be their surprise, nowhere to run to, aye?"  </p><p></p><p>The first voice is gruff, hardened, frustrated.  A man looking to take out some repressed emotions in the form of extreme physical violence.  The other has a rather rat-like sound to his voice.  Nasally, with words spat quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two sound like they're rummaging around the room for something.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume head further down the hall, into an area with rows of cell doors.  Some are bars on hinges where you can see into the cell.  Others are like the door Dieter and Frume were behind, heavy oak with banded iron bracings.  The latter are at the end of the hallway.  The very last one is standing ajar, an arm flopped outside of the opening.  As Dieter takes a few steps, Frume catches his arm.</p></div>
