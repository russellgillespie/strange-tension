<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks Frumious dead in the eyes and says,</i> “I will hold this for you until you can hold it again. We will not give up on your recovery. We must go now. “</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the party makes its way through goblin warrens, you peek into the room you missed on the right the first time you passed by.  Dieter sticks his head in.  This room tapers to the back wall and the corners.  It is littered with dung, egg shells, and noxious fumes.  The floor is a viscous mud/dung mix.  He doesn't see anything or anyone in the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party passes through the remains of the fireworks room and into the cavern of the goblin wallower.  The thing takes up a good portion of the room, however it doesn't look to be interested in any of the members of your team.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The group moves down the narrow hall.  Five feet in...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees an arrow fly though the air at him and lodge itself in the clay wall to his right.  Grunts and words in the goblin tongue can be heard from around the corner.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Neither Maouelue nor Dieter can see the goblins at this time.  Looks like they're waiting around the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sneaks up at the corner and sees three goblins waiting for the group to breech the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All three have their shortbows up and ready.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin is sliced in twain and doesn't even realize it.  The top half slides off slowly, and while the arrow is still nocked, the goblin splits and the two halves fall away.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard gives it a cursory tug as Dieter backs up a pace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens, with some effort.  Scraping of stone-on-stone echoes in the pillar room.  The stone people and basilisks are still holding their positions.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The mage sifts through the slop and comes up with a tarnished iron key.</p></div>
