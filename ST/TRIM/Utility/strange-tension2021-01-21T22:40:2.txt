strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>And they are both very pleased with it!  Daran's not overly fond of high spice, and it is rare to find many elves that are, but the taste and the heat pair well together.  The two settle in to the wine as well.  The first sip goes to Maouelue's head, but he's able to shake away the centered effect.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, on the other hand, pauses for a few moments, drink halfway to set on the table.  A good 30 seconds later, Daran closes his eyes and shakes his head.  Then looks at Maouelue and laughs!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Some vintage!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Quite pleasant indeed!” Maouelue states cooly. </p><p>“I wonder when that carriage will arrive. It sounds like we’ll be riding in style eh there Daran?” He slaps him on the back with a air of friendly banter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran smiles and he tucks into more food.  The waiter arrives again, bringing a frilly plate of appetizers piled high.  "Enjoy!" he says with a flourish and bow, and promptly exits.  Murmurs from around the assembled patrons catch the pairs attention, and they look down the street to see a large, golden carriage pulled by four stark white draft horses.  If it were full sunlight, the scene would be blinding.  But in the seemingly forever late evening sunlight, it is resplendent in a golden aura, an orange-hued halo surrounding everything.  Some of the elves in attendance stand and clap, believing a member of the Court to be inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What did I tell you! Riding in style.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks in slack-jawed horror between the people clapping, the carriage, the opulent scene unfolding before him.  The guard that suggested the restaurant hops is marching at the front of the procession.  He sees the group, waves, and makes his way over, the horses being driven around to a more sequestered location.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter comes out again, this time with the fish, and the guard lets out a little yelp.  He thanks the waiter, sits down to tuck in, and says, "Thank you gentlemen most kindly.  This is truly a treat."  To the other guard, he says, "Did I miss anything?"  The other shakes their head and stands at attention off to the side, taking his job extremely seriously.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage stops in front of the shop and Bellatrix and her sister step out.  They both give Maouelue mischievous grins and start making their way into the restaurant.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Well, this just keeps getting better and better,</i> he smiles to himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A twinkle of the crows foot, a cool gesture with an outstretched palm.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix grasps the hand as she passes by, into the main part of the restaurant.  Daran arches an eyebrow and smiles, shaking his head.  The guard is making loud slurping sounds, making some around them turn to look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter comes out with two large plates, on which roasted half birds sit, surrounded by flowers and vegetables.  "Enjoy," he says again, bowing and flourishing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue stands up and begins to toast his company a bit ostentatiously, eyeing fleetingly the various groups around the room as he does so, monitoring their responses in a bit of a baiting manner. They are making a scene here and he wants the onlookers to know also that they are seen. </p><p></p><p>“My friends! Thank you for gathering here with me on this fine day. The best bottles and bottles to each of you, oh companions of renown. Though the eyes of our foes be many, the resolve of our hearts be true! Long live Queen Titania and Lord Oberon, and may our friendship and kinship be renewed and strengthened as we fight for the heart of this city!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us raise our glasses to, those who have fallen,  those  who are falling, and those who teeter on the precipice.” At this last, he lets his eyes linger on the hushed group he and Daran had been monitoring, nearly imperceptibly nodding his head in their direction before returning his gaze to Bellatrix and the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Applause bursts out from the surrounding tables, cackling from the sister, and general merriment at the boisterous words.  Bellatrix gives Maouelue a wry smile and a tilt of the head, as if in wonder of what his plans hold next.  Several waiters come out to fill empty and empty-ing goblets and glasses.  Even the crowd outside of the restaurant gets in on the positive attitude, some even entering the establishment because of it.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
