strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The party starts noticing that the tunnel looks carved out of the clay heavy soil.  It is ten feet high, a little less than ten feet wide.  The walls look damp but not wet.  A heavy smell of earth hangs everywhere.  Along with the tang of iron, but that could be from your bloodstained clothes...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The silence is the worst part.  Sounds echo, every footfall, even though they're quiet, sound like a heavily laden <i>thump</i> as you all walk.  Stenchy sounds like a bucket of silverware jouncing around.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue winces at each echoing step, but there's not much for it at this point. He makes a palms down gesture to Stenchy trying to get him to lighten his footsteps. Stenchy makes a show of understanding and doing so, but it does almost nothing to change the clatter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tells Maouelue and Stenchy to hold for a moment and takes the torch from Stenchy, moving forward along the passage with Frenchy to scout a bit more stealthily.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the two proceed stealthily up the tunnel, they come to a bisection in the path.  One tunnel goes NE, the other SE.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is keen to keep track of the crew while they wait, maintaining their stealth. He re-summons his spirit bat to keep track of the scouts.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>On second thought, there's no time for that nonsense. Maouelue slowly leads the fighter forward with his elf vision making sure to stay well behind any sign of the light from their companions.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter makes a mark in the ground with his staff pointing down the SE corridor and moves forward with Frenchy. They hear some plated footfalls distantly behind them and get a sense of what's going on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair travel down the path, cautiously looking around, taking in everything.  </p><p>(Perception check from both, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frenchy moves his foot slowly down the path, he feels the floor... change.  It is raised in this part.  Not significantly, but enough for him to feel it under his boot.  He puts a hand out to stop Dieter from passing him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy stoops down to inspect the change in the floor and beckons Dieter to do the same.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a distinct line of something on the floor.  (Frenchy or Dieter can get his fingers underneath it, if they want.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter digs underneath the object carefully, brushing away the debris.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a padded piece of wood, the covering made to look and feel like the surrounding floor.  It lifts easily... and the stench of rotting, decaying meat hit you both full and hard. (CON save.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both feel an urge to vomit as the wood plank is moved away.  It stretches the width of the floor and extends to fifteen feet forward down the tunnel.  The wood feels flimsy under your fingers.  You both can also see that the tunnel tapers at the edge of the torch light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Steadying themselves and holding their breath, they look for what might be the source of the stench under the board.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The board is moved back, slowly, carefully.  A trench full of body parts, in various states of decay, lie ten feet deep.  Sharp points of some sort stick up here and there within the pit.  As you peer further into the miasma or filth...  something moves.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two watch as whatever is in the grossness moves from their left to right, getting slightly farther away from them in the process.  Sick gurgling sounds, squelching and liquid <i>flops</i> can be heard as the thing moves around.  It doesn't seem to sense your presence, for the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What used to be limbs get sucked below the mire as you both watch on.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torch sticks into the abdomen of what might have been an orc, it's green skin turning mottled black, blue, and purple.  It descends almost to the fire, but stays steadfastly pointed up.  (Stealth checks for both again, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The movement from underneath the pile stops suddenly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter cannot make out the size and shape or movement of this creature, but Frenchy believes he does.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy spots something slinking towards the pair...  Then loses it.  He thought it looked like a slug of some sort, but didn't get a great look at it when it surfaced?  Did it surface?  The smell is somehow getting stronger.  (CON save, please, for both!)</p></div>
