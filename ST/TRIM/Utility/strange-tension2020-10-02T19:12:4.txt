strange-tension*Dieter, chastened by his earlier brazenness wants to try and determine whether these creatures might be able to alert them to any potential ambush points in and around the cave.*
Dieter doesn't get words, more pictures and feelings from the animals.  They send a lot of struggling with their fellows, scavenging for food and shelter where they can.  They can to this cave, drawn by the smell, only very recently.  They only know the layout of this room, and the garbage pile a few tunnels over.
They do not sense nor have they seen any other living creature in these tunnels.  They've seen a lot of dead ones, though.
*Dieter attempts to tell them that his party means them no harm and they are just here as ore scavengers. He then nods to his party to move over to the silver vein and begin mining.*
The rat-things go back to their feast.
*The group divvies up their assorted tools and being chipping furiously away at the ore vein. They all seem to feel a deserving lust for the shimmering metal, buoyed by their recent hardships.*

*The group mines for 4 hours taking turns at the pickaxe and sifting through the rubble keying in on the choicest nugs available.*
*As their arms begin to tire a bit, they suggest a break for some rations and to gather their findings into the cart.*
Your group digs for some time, narrowly missing stepping on these strange creatures that always seem to be underfoot.  A few hours in, you stop for a break.  Just as you all start again, Douglas's pickaxe lands on something wooden.
Dieter and Maouelue rush over, and Dieter immediately remembers that there was a strange crevice or depression in the rock wall that they meant to investigate.
You all dig in this one spot, finally uncovering an old chest.  Decorated in gothic iron scrollwork, it reminds all of you of the classic pirates chest in stories of old.
There is a huge, gaudy lock on the front, banded into the wood by thick iron bands.  The thing weighs a ton.  It takes all three of you to pry it from the wall.
*Dieter examines the lock looking at the shape of the keyhole/mechanism. He wonders who put this here and whether a means of opening this chest might lie in these halls.*
*Maouelue considers the gothic markings, running them against his knowledge of ancient scripts.*
The torchlight plays off the rough clay/dirt walls eerily.  The iron and wood of the chest seem to drink it in, making the room dim.  A breeze wafts past the three of you, source- less, but no one notices.


*Maouelue drools slightly as he falls into a stupor while considering the markings.*
*Dieter's pulse quickens...*
Maouelue can't grasp the markings on the bands of iron, they're eroded away too much.  Something, some nugget of a memory pops into Dieters mind, completely unbidden.
He remembers a story of an artificer, a maker of magical items.  He was a sailor, a pirate really, who searched far and wide for a special magic that would make his items renown the world over.  Across the seas, a land of giants harnessed the power of runespells.  Their brand of runic magic was so powerful, it was said to imbue items with a life of their own.  They didn't use their magic for wealth or power, but mainly protection from the outside world.
This pirate found their enclave, slew their leaders, and forced the shamans of the tribe to divulge all of their secrets.  In the years that followed, not only did the pirate become rich and powerful, he became unstoppable.
There came a day that the crew became so frightened of him, half of them mutinied while the other half fled as fast as they could.  Alone, listless on the high seas, the artificer's last days are unknown to anyone.
There is something etched around the lock.  Dust and dirt obscure the writing.
*Dieter rubs the corner of his shirt over the lock, then pours a dash of water from his skein to rinse off the residue. He peers intently...*


Maouelue can make out a couple runes, but not all.  *R-NE--R-*
Douglas is about to say something, then stops, the thought fading before it really begins.
*The party loads whatever they can muster along with the chest and heads back to the cave entrance.*


*Dieter disappointedly hangs his head and unwittingly lays eyes on his Henchmen Mirror. Oddly the face(s?) staring back at him is(are?) not his own...*
Four henchmen (Please feel free to describe their look) appear out of thin air.  Douglas nearly jumps out of his skin, wondering how in that hell that happened.
With all seven of you working together, you manage to not only lift the chest but you all put it in the mine cart.  The four henchmen take positions at the rear, ready to push it into town for you.




Deleted counter inspiration.
*The men merrily roll out to the front of the cave, the henchmen particularly enthusiastic about their good fortune!*
