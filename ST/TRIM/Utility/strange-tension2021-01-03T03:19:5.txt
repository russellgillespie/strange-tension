strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>“Now now Flayco, I’m sorry I hit you with that. My hand was a bit shaky and...Don’t Eat Jaecob! He’s a friend. Friiiieeeeennnndd. F. R. I. E. N. D. Friend. Got it?” He gives a reassuring rub on the top of the whelp’s head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It gives the high pitched squeal that settles to a purr.  (Gotta start calling Dieter Flacco from now on...)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a clanking that comes from the chest, the clicking has taken a strange cast.  Probably because it's been going crazy for so long.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We’ll go find some tasty thief for you pup, there’s plenty to go around. No Jaecob though y’hear?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks worriedly at the chest. “I’m gonna go see what this is all about.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It cocks it's head at Dieter again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He gives a stern two-eyed stare back at the beast and points two fingers at his own eyes, the rotates them back and forth between he and it. He then proceeds over to the chest and gives it an inspection.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks into the chest to find a human heart.  Which is still beating, thanks to the workings of a small object.  Dieter blinks.  Blinks again.  He could swear it looks just like a goldfish.  In a small sphere.  On closer inspection, it is just that.  A clockwork fish swimming and floating, helping the heart continue it's macabre beating.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Bloody waters!” The distressed druid decrees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A vision of the clean, refreshing wate of the Sword Coast flashes through his mind. Calling him home. He can’t go on like this much longer, without light, without air, without green and blue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out to pick up the wretched object, his furry hands quivering as he does so. “Formulated Flippers! This is some piece of work...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing is still wet to the touch, it still looks healthy enough.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter studies the heart, all of it's workings, the connections to the machination.  A small voice speaks up in the back of his mind... </p><p><i>"The damn flayers took out my heart!  To the Hells with them, Druid!  We must send them from whence they came.  Hurry, now.  You almost have everything you need to dispose of their filth.  Destroy their gruesome experiment and take the weapon from the other room.  Then we shall be rid of this prison for good!"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter wraps the fishheart globe in what wrappings he can find and stows it in his pack. He wonders is the good folks over at Bags of Holding Inc.™️ have added a soundproofing feature, then supposed he’ll find out soon enough, at any rate this one is value all the way. He tightens the pack back up then calls to his menagerie. “Time to move out!” He knocks on Shelli’s shell and beckons her out. “Hey there girl, I need you to do me a solid. Can you carry out friend here?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He assumes whatever “Blaaaalkkkeee” means is some form of snail assent and begins to load Jaecob’s prone body onto the Flail Snail, hoping the shell is comfortable enough to ride but not enough to sleep.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter turns around and sees Flayco nibbling on Jaecob's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Don’t. Eat. JAECOB!!!” He shrieks at the mass of wings and tentacles. He tries to pry off the hungry hungry Flayco from the only Human company that remains to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacles rise, Flayco looks at the druid.  Dieter can see the little, sharp teeth drawing blood on Jaecob's forehead.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls the heart-fish-globe back out and holds it up directly in front of Flayco’s eyes, waving it back and forth in a hypnotic manner. “Do you want this ball? Do ya? Do you want this ball?” He then rolls it away from Jaecob back through the weave of tents and says, “Go get it!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Clearly the psychic damage is taking its toll on the Druid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter hears a disgusting <i>slurpp</i> as the baby dragon peels itself off of Jaecob.  It's beady eyes lock on to the sphere and he scrabbles after it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shouts, “That’s my good boy!”, then turns to examine the fresh would on his incapacitated friend with the increasingly inconvenient illithid ingestion injury.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hair on top of his head is now matted with blood.  There is a small tracing of marks around the crown of his head, but it looks like this was too big of a quarry for the little illithi-dragon.  Still, Muhlen is not looking great.  He is still stable, however.</p></div>
