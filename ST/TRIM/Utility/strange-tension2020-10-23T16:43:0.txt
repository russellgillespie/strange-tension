As the hit happens, the party sees the green of the mace deepen and sparkle.  The armor, still ringing, starts shrinking into a smaller version of itself!  The armor is now approximately 9 inches tall.  It looks up at the druid, wondering what in the hell happened.  It's still hugging Dieter's leg.</p></div>
