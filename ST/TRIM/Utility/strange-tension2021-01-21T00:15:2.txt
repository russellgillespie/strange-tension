I would learn of the Fortess of Frozen Tears, for I have heard a small bit that has peaked my interest. Last, I would learn of the trials and rights of lineage of the peoples here. I am a sort of anthropologist that comes from Faerun. I am curious to compare the Sylvan traditions with those of the Feywild...</p><p></p><p>...oh, and yes, whatever spell scrolls you might have about. I would peruse them if they be available.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh.. Oh, my, yes!"  Her hands patter while she looks around the shop.  She tries to steady herself and centers back on Maouelue.  "I can get you the appropriate texts you would need about the Fortress of Frozen tears and the Trials of the Eldar.  OH!  And I have <i>many</i> texts and scrolls on the planes and travel between them.  You come from Faerun, you say!  Oh my, that's <i>lovely</i>!  Tell you what, I'll get some items together, and you and your friend can peruse the spell scrolls at the rear of the store.  They're arranged alphabetically and by level.  I'll meet you back there soon?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Fantastic! The name’s Maouelue, though I used to go by Lumao. You may use either. What is your name mistress?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks shyly at the mage, curtsies, and says, "Nuala Beilyn, m'lord.  Please, take your time to look through my family's store.  I'll gather your texts!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaaah let's see, well for starters, I've always been keen on a certain little tidbit called <i>Ice Knife</i>. Do you have one of those around? I'll consider some others while you look."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"About what rates are these going for by the by? I've not had cause to shop in this city prior."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran helps Maouelue look.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Thinking back to his encounter with the giants and goblins in the forest, he adds, "What about Expeditious Retreat as well?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"...Cloud of Daggers?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm...What else...errr...Lightning Bolt?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok ok. and you know the last thing I'm looking for is...Frost Fingers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With Daran's help, the wizard is able to find Ice Knife, Expeditious Retreat, Lightning Bolt, and Frost Fingers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman comes back with a pile of books.  She places them down next to Maouelue and asks, "Did you find the scrolls you were looking for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“A far few indeed! And see what it is you’ve got there! Oh I do love a good lore dump.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Don't meant to be too brash, but what might we be looking at for this lot?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, my!  Let's take a look."  She peruses the lot.  "All of those, that will be 550 gold pieces.  You might not want all the ones I've found, but all together," Maouelue looks and there's seven books the woman found, "with the scrolls and the books, 800 gold pieces."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue holds out 800 of the gold coin from the armory and accepts the goods. “Thank you for ever so much. Your work will be put to very good ends. I’m sure I’ll be in again sometime. Adieu madam.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nuala takes the money, and says, "Thank you, m'lord.   Here is a satchel, for you to take everything!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Feywild</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The story sort of reads like a fairy tale (which makes complete sense!) about the son of Queen Titania.  He held court and was attended by three Daughters of Delight.  He was in love with one of them, Sharaea, in fact they were betrothed.  Something changed, however, and she absconded to the mortal plane where she fell in love with an adventurer and devoted her life to fighting evil.  The Sun Prince grew jealous and hunted the pair down relentlessly.  Eventually, he caught up to the two and imprisoned them both.  With her mortal love destined for death, Sharaea made a pact with the Raven Queen to save them both.  The archfey cast the two souls ahead in time, hoping to slake the temper of the Sun Prince.  This act, however, broke the Prince, and he left the city of Astrazalian, never to return.  He made his new home in the Vale of Long Night, and built a tower there, naming it the Fortress of Frozen Tears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A lot of legends swirl around the Pale Prince and his lands.  There is one that mentions his defeat bringing back summer to the Vale, however it incurs the wrath of Queen Titania, so the truth is murky.</p></div>
