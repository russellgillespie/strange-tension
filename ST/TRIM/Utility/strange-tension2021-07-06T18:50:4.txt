strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>He takes some time clearing out old rations and filling up his stores. Jaecob follows suit and several fists full of meat and fruit are sent to the snapping maws of Flayco and Shelli.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco gobbles with relish.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But he wishes it were brains.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Sweet, sweet brains.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Full now in belly and in bag, the move to the East room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll get you some brains soon Flay...." <i>Pathetic little whelp.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is nearly a mimic of the long hallway with banners that you all had just come from.  (If you want to enter this room, we'll have to pause.  I want to give you a good description and it leads to a few other rooms.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A 100 ft long hallway greets the foursome, mimicking the hall of banners you had just come from.  Although, there are no banners here.  Just tall, fluted columns with scratches at the bottom of them, as if from an animal...  or a pack of them.  The rest of the stonework also have these claw marks, they go up about five feet all around, but no higher.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes a closer looks at the scratching, being no stranger to clawing a wall or two himself. What kind of creatures might have done this?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A myriad of doorways abound...  one on the N wall, 2 open hallways and 2 doors to the E, one door to W.  To the south, a shrine.  A bust of a massive illithid covers the entire S wall, bookended by two flaming torches.  A few lighted sconces send eerie shadows all around.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's strange, Dieter thinks they look like large wolf marks, maybe a dire wolf.  But there are a lot.  As he peers deeper, he sees dried blood between the cracks of the flagstones.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúCome Flayco, let us gaze upon this shrine together.‚Äù He leads the young abomination over to admire the shrine.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's an abomination, but a nice likeness to Flayco.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco gawks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúCome, let‚Äôs keep moving.‚Äù Dieter says, leading them to the southeast passageway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall turns sharply to the left twenty feet down, the light fades down this corridor.  Turning left, the party sees two doors on the right, one on the left, a hallway on the left near the end of the hallway, and an open doorway at the end, 75 feet away.  A flickering light can be seen beyond the doorway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A strange sounds echoes down the hallway, eerie to Dieter's ears.  It sounds like...  wet mumbling?</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Did one of you just... wait... no, it's something else..." Dieter looks around to get a direction on the source of the sound and heads towards it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Ho... ly...  Shite..   gotta get my old maps out here... üòâ</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The motley crew of a road-hardened druid, a grimy noble-cum-fighter, an odd amalgamation of a dragon and an illithid, and a giant snail make their way through the torch-lit hallway.  Closer and closer the mumbling comes.  The door is halfway open, and just from the opening, Dieter can make out a cozy room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bookshelves line the walls, most are overflowing with scrolls and parchment.  A large light source seems to be coming from just beyond the door, as is the mumbling.  Wet, gurgling mumbles emanate from the space in the room no one can see.  Flaco gets more and more animated as the group closes in on the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A ghostly voice passes by Dieter's ear, riding a cold breeze.  "Yesss...  this way, druid.  My final resting place is close..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shudders but heeds the call and moves to follow, his hand at the ready on his bladestaff.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Active character changed to Dieter Deleter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"<i>Muhlen...</i>" Dieter mutters. <i>Damnable fool....</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>...and he walks on down the hall...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid pushes the door open...</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter grips the Annilus hard and grits his teeth as this invasive voice probes his mind, willing it out of his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The voice becomes a trickle then a whisper as it is forced from Dieter's mind altogether.  Surprise tinges the illithid's face as it feels this too.  He floats-rises to standing beside his contained ritual fire.  Pointing at the newcomers, he hisses through tentacled facial appendages and it's hands are wreathed in a purple-blue light.</p></div>
