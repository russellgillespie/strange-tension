I've no idea what you'd been through, don't blame me if i thought you were putting us on with this."  He taps the paper.</p><p>Looking back and forth between the four others, he says, "You all seriously don't know what this is?  The 'black spot'?  You've never heard the old sailor's tales of the 'black spot'?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad and Vam look on in confusion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well...  that's fair.  Story's simple really, there're tales about pirates receiving this same mark, parchment with a ink spot on it, when they're marked for death.  I thought it was a mere child's story..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam shakes his head, studies the parchment again.  </p><p>"Can you point out the runes, here?  I don't see anything like that."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The big man is now sitting on a padded bench, away from the group, close to the window at the front of the house.  He's chewing his nails and his knees are bouncing rapidly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter turns imploringly toward the large uncomfortable man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad starts whining, pitching higher and higher.  He holds his hands on his ears on both sides of his head.  He rocks back and forth, slowly at first...  then he picks up pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a nearby glass of water and levitates the contents over toward Bazad. He shapes it slowly into each rune in the circle in front of the man's face trying to force him out of his shocked reticence.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad continues to rock, hands over ears.  He is staring directly at the runic waterscape.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood starts coming out of Bazad's eyes and ears.  Soon his eyesockets rain blood down his face.  He's screaming and still rocking back and forth.  Suddenly he bolts upright and runs for the front door, bumping into Vam and the door frame on his way out.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad falls down in the middle of the street, apparently asleep.  (How far away is the party?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Strange bits of sand fall off of the dunegrass summoned by Dieter's entangling vines. As Maouelue sees the spell fizzle as Bazad gets away, and in a fit of inspiration pulls up several grains and sends them out ins a z-shaped wave toward the fleeing man!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you make your way toward the prone man...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ground shakes beneath you.  Lines of dirt and sand puff and blow into the air.  The lines circle around the group, making their way indirectly towards the man lying in the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter calls out his charge, two snake-like creatures <i>pop</i> from the ground around Bazad!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The pair address the snakes and consider them dubiously.</i></p></div>
