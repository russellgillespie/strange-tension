He speaks a word of warmth...</p><p></p><p>"Let the fires of our hearts heat the hearth in this humble home."</p><p></p><p>As he says this, a blast of flames flows outward toward the ceiling, melting the ice into falling drops of water. Then, as the water falls and pools, he speaks a word of shaping and cooling, sending two large planes of water to either side of the group. He holds the makeshift walls of water in place, then concentrates on freezing them in place, leaving just enough of a gap at the top of each for airflow.</p><p></p><p>With this complete, he magically sops up the remainder of the water from the ground and patches up the edges, securing them in place. He then invites the group to circle round and huddle in.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao sits, stroking his trusty hawk, as he slips into his reverie, oddly distant. Daran sees that the sisters are situated for a rest before taking up the watch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A couple hours into the watch, Daran hears a scratching on the other side of the ice-wall.  The side that faces further into the mountain.  He can see movement on the other side as well.  Something big and hulking is moving back and forth along the ice wall...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He decides not to wake anyone just yet and try to surmise what the beast is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A second white blur comes along and scratches the ice as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And then, a third...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hides, trying not to move a muscle for fear the beasts might see him though the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's only about an hour left in Maouelue's reverie.  If they can just hold out...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The scratches turn to pounding.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are low roars and some commotion.  Maouelue hears these murmurings and random poundings as he finishes his reverie.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He sees Daran, motionless, kneeling with hands on scimitars, ready to jump into action.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Silently coming back into the immediate consciousness, the mage directs the hawk silently to fly up and try to peer through the air hole at the top of the back ice wall, trying to get a better view on the beasts beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are four creatures there.  Maouelue sees through the hawks eyes...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue tries to get Daran's attention and whispers ever so softly, "I will take the watch from here brother. Please take your rest while I monitor these yeti."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will try.  If you need me, I'll be ready to fight."  He slowly crosses over to lean against the cave wall, sitting cross-legged, hands still on scimitars.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"<i>Quiet!</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One leaves, the others are starting to lose interest as well.  (One more?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two are still hanging around, but not pounding or scratching...  (Un mas?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader starts clawing and scratching, taking some small gouges out of the ice.  The second does nothing.  (Last one!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran's eyes fly open as he finishes his reverie.  He takes second to assess the situation, then whispers, "Are they coming in?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>‚ÄúThey seem to be turning away for now, but let us consider the situation a bit...‚Äù</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao directs the hawk to follow the Yetis‚Äô retreat whenever the last one decides to turn away. He wants to see more of these caves if he can manage it. Perhaps his old trusty bat may be required in a little while...but for now he trusts the hawk‚Äôs eye. </p><p>ü¶á ü¶Ö</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The scratches start breaking away parts of the wall, showing the wizard a furry white paw.  Grunts and growls greet the group, too.  The sisters wake up groggily, but they're able to keep their surprise under control.  Maouelue also notices, the walls are starting to melt from the top.   The hawk is having a rougher time staying on a perch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The metal mage channels a quick spell to blind the yeti, hoping to disorient it and follow it where it may lead.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue makes to cast the yeti into darkness, but the spell doesn't go off.  The big arm starts to make it's way inside and feel around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other, however, is no longer interested.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran whips a scimitar out, ready to cut off the monster's paw...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Daran lashes out with the scimitar.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The scimitar slices into the fuzzy arm, dealing it a big gash, but not completely cutting it off.  The arm is promptly removed to howls and growls from beyond the ice wall.  "Run or fight, captain?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ha! <i>Now</i> he asks!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Stand and fight!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao pulls out his Eladrin bow and nocks an arrow.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ha!  Let's get at it then!"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>YE1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (3) + 1 = <code>4</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>BL1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (19) + 2 = <code>21</code>.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A greenish blast bursts forth from the witch with what used to be red beams of light intertwined, now turning a bluish purple, ringed with white. They beam through the hole in the ice straight for the Yeti, one impacting on the edge of the hole, the others finding their marks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins whispering to the fiber and grain of string and bow, sending out a cool yellow glow across the weapon.</p></div>
