<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around at the stables, scratching his chin.  "Lemme see what I can round up.  Meet you back here in a few."  He makes haste out of the barn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a beat and looks around at one of the last remnants of the Oakhurst he was just beginning to know and love. Here where they held that fateful council...What a mess! What impetuous hubris. The dark currents run deep and they are not easily displaced. One would do well to remember this going forward.</p><p></p><p>He makes for the main building and comes into Bellatrix's view checking on her reverie.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well, let's just say I've got a fancy new hat!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He trades the Frostbitten Helm for the supplely-scaled, pointed had.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Our steeds arrive and we are off to put this dread pattern right!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Turning from the fire, she gives the wizard a deep look.  Without knowing her, some would say it was a dark, foreboding gesture.  Knowing who she is... it might still be foreboding, but Maouelue knows it as a introspective look.  She purses her lips, goes into her pack.  "Would you allow me an... insight?  Into our upcoming venture?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue slows his gusto replies reverently, “Of course, anything.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What would you ask of me?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Often people are scared of that which they cannot see, hear, physically interact with.  You and I know, however, that there is a weave to the world that is unseen, yet bonds everything together.  There are ways to manipulate this weave.  But for every action, there is a reaction.  Every now and again, I like to try and see the eventuality of those actions and reactions.  I give you the choice - rune, card, or dice?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Rune.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>h!rune</p></div>
<div class="character-5"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mysterious woman smirks a little at the choice.  She reaches into her pack, closes her eyes, rummages more.  Then, slowly, she brings her closed fist out of the bag.  </p><p>"Runes help us connect with the elements.  They are an intimate connection to our inner being.  My runes have been with me for a very long time, since I was a child.  The longer you have a connection with them, and the closer they are to the body in that time, the more accurate they can be."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With that, she opens her hand.  The rune that looks back at you is carved into smooth, sanded bone.  The carved section is black, contrasting greatly against the bleached white of the bone.  Bellatrix's smile fades as she looks at the symbol.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“This symbol is out of balance.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She peers at you and squints. "You've recently found a new deity.   But that deity has some connection to the horrors you've faced.  Even with the heightened piety, or maybe because of it, you are more of a target than ever before.  Not just by the forces you seek out.  Things move in the shadows, to compel you off of your path.  Or maybe onto the correct one?  Maouelue, be wary of going farther away or closer to your patron.  You are on a shield balanced atop a sword.  One slight move any way might plunge you into chaos."</p></div>
