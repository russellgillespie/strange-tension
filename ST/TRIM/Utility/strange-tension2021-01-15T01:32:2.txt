strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>"Yes, I believe that is the best course of action. My ears are open fellows, let us listen deeply and understand much."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Very well." Everyone packs up and begins heading our, Otirnis leading the way silently.  Bellatrix and the old woman follow the female eladrin, while Maouelue and the eladrin leader speak behind them.  Taking up the rear is Daran, ever watchful.  As all eyes scan the forest for signs of movement, life, or danger.  (Imagine the story telling as a beautiful ballad, not the quick-and-dirty I'm going to drop here!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't know how much you know about the Feywild, so I'll start there.  It is our understanding that we are a part of your material plane, and yet not.  We are the closest cross-over, however we are also afloat in the astral sea.  Some say we are a part of Arvandor, which is why Elves find themselves renewed here above all else.  Some say we're a plane of Olympus of Celestia, where the great dragon dwells.  In truth, we are simply...  the Feywild.  And we do what we can to preserve the balance of good and evil while benefitting from this land's beauty.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Otirnis and I are the protectors of seelie fey.  Our court is led by the High Queen Titania, and her Lord Oberon.  They rule in the city in the clouds, Senaliesse.  All of the seelie archfey live there, which is nigh impenetrable from its place in the heavens.  For us and our part, we live in the city of Astrazalian, which is watched after by Queen Titania's sister, the good sister, Queen Tiandra.  The bad sister, The Queen of Air and Darkness," he shudders, "She lives in the Feydark and commands forces of those abominations you fought earlier. Fomorians, they're known as.  Diseased and deformed because of their love of deceit and trickery.  They would have us seelie fey grovel and serve them for eternity, which is why we fight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Queen of Air and Darkness has no love in her heart.  She was to be the one to look over Astrazalian, but a contingent of dwarves brought the woman a black crystal that turned her heart to stone and bent her will to evil.  She will stop at nothing to rid this great land of the seelie fey.  Her co-horts, they're considered the unseelie.  Problem is, you never can tell which you're speaking with until it's too late.  Part of our hesitation with you and your folk here, mage.  Again, I hope that you will forgive us our intensity.   But it is how we have to be with our borders under constant attack.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And lately, not just our borders.  Astrazalian has been attacked thrice in the last season.  Once in ten years is even more than normal, so this...  I can tell you, both Queens Titania and Tiandra are concerned what this means for the future of the feywild at large.  Goblins are joining with the fomorians.  They're recruiting the Moon Court, as well.  Which means lycanthropes may be at our gates at night, and giants and goblins attack during the day.  No one can fight a battle on three sides.  And there might be an archwizard at play here, too.  From your world.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Needless to say, aside from all of our martial ability and arcane skill, we're at a deficit.  We'd like to get more outliers to band together, but it is political and difficult.  Our foursome are a scouting party for both new members, and for the movement of the opposing forces.   There have been rumors, however, that Queen Titania would like a rogue group to go behind enemy lines and strike at the heart of the insurgence."</p></div>
