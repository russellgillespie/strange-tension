strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Another bard comes up, this one an autumn eladrin, bronze skin shining in the evening light.  She has a beautifully crafted lute, and she hums up to the edge of the restaurant's outdoor seating to a smattering of claps.  </p><p>In a heavy brogue, the eladrin bard says in a loud voice, "Did I hear someone want to know the tale of the Black Ship of the Shee Alus, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Applause from most of the tables.  Every one except Maouelue's new friends.  Silence comes from them.  A few of them even look... scared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Play on mistress!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bard gets a glint in her eye.  She bows to Maouelue, then picks up a sea shanty rhythm and tempo.  The crowd starts stomping along, clapping in time with the beat as the woman gets into a groove...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An amazing thing happens as she starts to sing.  Maouelue sees the reality of what's happening, but another layer, like a film across his eyes, show him the happenings of her words.</p><p></p><p>She tells of a group of elves, power hungry and hell-bent on ruling the waters of the Feywild.  These peoples made their slaves create a mighty ship, black as obsidian with black sails to match.  It looked like a thunderhead as it rode the waves, and in a storm, is was completely hidden.  It manned many wizards who controlled the weather, to make it storm around their black ship at all times.  And with that dire boat, they ruled the oceans of the Fey.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Until one day, they met with a more powerful fiend.  From the depths it rose, chasing, then catching the mariners and their formidable craft.  In an instant, they were cast asunder, forever lost to the sea.  They only reason people knew of this tale is because the black ship was never seen on the waves again.  Peace came to the harbors and islands.  Life was sweet.  But every once in a while, people say they can hear the music of the boat, drifting in from the deep waters.  Singing of doom from the pirates below the sea.  And their new god.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a minor chord and a final bow, the woman closes her song to silence.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue slowly stands and begins to applaud. “Enchanting...madam.” He flips her a gold coin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the group starts to clap until a full rousing chorus of applause comes into bloom.  Coins start cascading at her feet, and she bows again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, Tinebrae jumps up from the table and runs into the main restaurant, nearly knocking over a couple waiters bringing more food out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow her.” Maouleue whispers to the slick handler. Don’t worry, we’ll get you a box.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf nods, wipes his mouth, excuses himself to Bellatrix, and hastens away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bard retires from the spotlight, the street calms down to a relative normal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue and the group continue with their meal, the mage keeping an ear on the other group all the time now, as he makes pleasantries with the rest. After a while he calls for the tab and says they must be on their way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tab is produced, putting the mage out 200 gold.  (Daran helps out, too!)  They all start to disperse, running into the guard on their way out of The Queen's Smile.  Approaching Maouelue, he says, "She went into the kitchens, they won't let me in there.  I did look in, though, and she's sitting on a crate by the back door.  Might be able to go around, if you wish to speak with her, lord wizard."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Perhaps I will. Yes, perhaps I will. Pray take the others to the carriage. I will be along shortly.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short salute and he leads them away, promising the carriage will be waiting on the street for the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The wizard treks around to the back, taking down his ostentatious manner...as much as possible. There’s something about this situation that intrigues him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue makes his way to the rear of the building.  No one really marks his progress, but he does stand out.  A bit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The birds are chirping, the sun is...  still setting.  Maouelue hiccups.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Squirrel.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans up against the wall. “This was a good idea. Yup. Good idea.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, the back door opens dramatically.  The sullen woman steps out and starts walking away, weeping quietly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tinebrae...that is your name, is it not?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman jumps, startled.  Crying has ceased for the moment as she gets her bearings.  After a few seconds, she says, in a soft voice, "Yes.  My name is Tinebrae.  Why are you back here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I couldn’t help but note your interest in our party. Why do you flee?”</p></div>
