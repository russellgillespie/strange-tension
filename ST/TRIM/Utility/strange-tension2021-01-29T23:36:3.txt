strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Blackness overtakes Maouelue.  Dread dreams of darkness, where dragons dwell.  The snatches of images are brief, but what Maouelue will remember is the fear and uncertainty all around him.</p><p></p><p>He wakes in a comfortable bed, the setting sunlight streaming through the open windows.  It's a simple room, simple wooden bed.  The room is small and quaintly adorned.  Bellatrix sits next to the wizard, ringing out a cloth and is about to put it to his head when she notices he's awake.  She freezes, watching with wide eyes.  Waiting.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He blinks a few times, then raises his arm to shield the piercing sunlight. His vision begins to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"...Bella?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What...what happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stammers, mouth opening and closing.  Then she closes her mouth and throws herself at Maouelue, hugging him and crying softly.  "Oh, Mao.  I'm so sorry.  You must have been so scared.  It's...  It's...  Oh Mao, it's all my fault."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He is slow to react at first, surprised at her thrown embrace, then he wraps his arms around her, holding her close. Closing his eyes again, he says, "How? How could this be <i>your</i> fault? What happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I let the darkness out.  It is my fault.  You...  you and the Queen, you went to a side room.  The others said she did some sort of reading and that you and she had severe words.  She was concerned about your heritage and whether you had designs on her kingdom.  Madness, all of it.  And all of it laid at my feet.  You both had recessed in the side room, and then an explosion happened.  We heard it from the second floor, across the castle.  Daran said he saw you hovering off the ground and that gravity reversed itself.  The Queen was unconscious and the room was in turmoil.   Naturally, Daran tried to help.  He said you would never, but some guards and soldiers carried Titania away, and the rest escorted us out of the castle.  </p><p></p><p>"We're at an inn at the outskirts of the city.  Just outside of the Eastern docks.  They said we can have passage away from Astrazalian.  They said we can travel in the other lands, but are long longer welcomed by the Court.  Oh, I'm so sorry, Maouelue."  She cowers again against the wizard's chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The gravity of these words falls over the elf like an icy sheet. He shudders for a moment, but otherwise remains motionless, thinking. <i>Surely this can't have been all Bella's doing.</i> His zeal had gotten the better of him yet again, but it would not end here. No way. There were still too many questions left unanswered. <i>The Queen...</i> Once again, memory is a fit of haze. <i>What happened?!?</i> He would have to set this right. Soon. Now. There would be no future chance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's a soft knock on the closed door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We leave for Mag Tureah tonight."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pulls himself from Bella's embrace and goes to answer the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Who goes there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Otirnis, lord wizard.  Bearing a parting gift from the Queen and Court."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao opens the door, a tear frozen in the corner of his eye. "Otirnis, it is good of you to come. You are welcome here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows, hand to shoulder.  Then straightens and presents the book from the side room to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Queen sends her regrets that she is not able to deliver this in person.  She wishes you and your party well.   And she said to tell you, if you decide the opposite road of that which you have discussed before, she would be open to speaking again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Otirnis," he places his hand on his heart. "I will speak with the Queen."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin nods, salutes again, and says, "Very well.  Follow me."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao looks back at Bella, “Let us ready ourselves for the journey ahead. We will meet again with the Queen.” He turns back to Otirnis, “If it please her majesty, I would have us <i>all</i> attend.” He glances meaningfully at Bella, then assembled his things and begins to don his armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis adds, "I will wait by the front doors.  At your leisure, lord wizard."  Carrying her things already, Bellatrix helps Maouelue with his armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After a customary final sweep of the premises, the two leave through the front door to join their eldarin guard. “I am sorry to bring such trouble to your realm, Otirnis. Would that we could have met under different circumstances.”</p></div>
