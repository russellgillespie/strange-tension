strange-tensionJust before the bat's vision goes dark, the wizard sees...



*Maouelue sends his mage hand over to where the bat has just been consumed and tries to ready it to lure and pluck the Quipper out of the water should it jump.*




A fish tries to jump and bite the hand.  The hand moves to grab the fish.  They both miss.  Frenchy thinks he hears something, farther to the W of the cavern.  He can't be sure, though.
*Frenchy relays this info, but Maouelue urges the group around to the northeast passage heading away from the water...for now...*
*Frenchy glances back over his shoulder a few times keeping his eyes on the rearguard.*
(Group stealth check, please!



Stenchy hears something moving through the water as if its tracking your movements.
As the party makes it way to the NE opening, a tail splashes out of the water to make a grab at Frenchy!

The tail whips *just* past Frenchy.  Suddenly a humongous snake-man rears up from the water.  It has a python's head, to beefy arms, a human torso and legs, with a fifteen foot prehensile tail.

*Frenchy pulls back about 15ft and swivels to fire his crossbow at the beast.*

*Spieter has been waiting, watching foe something like this to happen from the cavern ceiling. His arachnid form starts to grow and grow, the eight legs turning into giant tentacles, the pincers turning into a maw....*

*Dieter was having delusions of grandeur...coming back to his senses, his eyes begin to glow red, then one of his eight legs curves and changes into a flaming sword as the rest of his body comes back to form.*



e is not a valid integer.



*Dieter drops down from the ceiling with the blade pointed straight down at the giant creature’s head.*

Deleted counter Inspiration.


Dieter, emerging like a wraith from the *ceiling* of the cave, flaming sword in hand, falls straight towards the ghastly snake!

And lands *on the monster's back* driving the sword point into it's back!

The snake-man tries to grab one of the henchmen while Dieter is on his back.  It does not go well.






*Maouelue charges his sling with magical energy then hurls a frozen orb at the lizard man, striking hard in the shoulder.*





Dieter, Maouelue, and Frenchy take 7 points of damage, Stenchy takes 3 points as a fog starts enveloping the entire cave.  There is a green glow that starts emanating from the bottom of the lake bed, some 35 feet from the party.  With the fog, though, the lights are a blur of color.   The snake-man smiles as he effectively disappears from view of the wizard and the henchmen.  Dieter is still hanging on for dear life.
*Frenchy, bewildered by the sudden appearance of the shining fog, takes a step back and readies his crossbow, waiting for the fog to potentially dissipate for a clear shot.*
*Dieter is fearful of being dragged under by this monster. He thinks fast. His head begins to elongate as his armor fades into his skin. His legs curl backward into a spiral and he becomes a...*

Giant Sea Horse (Dieter Deleter) removed from combat.

The druid tries to transform and backflip off of the snake while doing so.  Unfortunately, the snake-man was expecting this and grabs the seahorse *hard*.   While constricting Dieter, the druid reverts back, still grappled by the snake.



*Stenchy is similarly mesmerized by the sudden appearance of fog but does not care. He's here to smash things. He takes a giant swing with his __magical mace de retour__*

*Maouelue focuses his energy on the area where he last saw the snake and begins to weave his arms in the air, all of the fog in range begins condensing into orbs of ice spaced about 5 feet apart. It's quite a sight as he releases and lets them all drop.*




Another set of damage as the green glow sends more fog in the air.




*Frenchy thought that maybe their budding frost mage might have some method of dispersing this fog, but noOooooo. Frustrated, he releases his bolt now at the place he last saw the snake. He hopes Dieter is at least still on the backside...*


*Dieter is properly freaking out now. This situation got the better of his impetuous nature. He performs some quick maneuvers to regain his safety.*


*Dieter slashes with the fiery sword, then quickly disappears and reforms by his companions.*
The snake-man is furious at having his quarry so close in it's grasp get away.  It lets out a loud hissing cry and dives in the water.
