strange-tensionThe woman sees the towering druid above, then feels a bug landing on her and sees an enormous metal man emerging from the tree/scar.  She screams and screams, not knowing what in the world is happening....  And then the screaming fades as the woman loses consciousness.
*The two shrink greatly at the sound of the woman's screams. Quickly, they attempt to move her body below onto a bed of branches and thicket lying below.*


The woman goes limp in Maouelue's arms.  The two move her into the recesses of the room.  Sounds start coming from outside the ruined barrow.  Many voices shouting, running feet, the sounds of steel being unsheathed.
(With a nat 20) Maouelue can detect four distinct sets of footfalls coming nearer.  The two have only a few seconds to act before they get to you.
*Dieter, thinking fast, pulls out and throws the net of invisibility over Maouelue and the prone woman, then begins to tiptoe around the edge of the room toward the wall from which they heard the yells.*
*As they are ducking under the net, Maouelue holds up 4 fingers to Dieter meaningfully.*



*Dieter tries to move closer to the sound and readies a beach attack with his blades behind the door.*



Dieter knows from Maouelue there are four coming, but he doesn't know from where.  Maouelue can see one silhouette peeking through the broken stone window on the N side of the building.  Dieter knows someone is there, too, just hasn't seen them yet.
*Maouelue’s fingers grip around a smooth platinum orb, frosting it over as he does so.*

*They wait as silently as possible, anticipating the entrance of the bodies accompanying the voices. They are ready to strike but would prefer to stay undetected if possible. Maouleue keeps one eye on the sleeping figure at his feet while he watches the door.*
*Dieter, invisible as he is, takes a  clearer look through the window.*


Dieter peeks out and almost bumps into the man peering through the broken window.  He's flanked by three more burly men, looking for other breaks or entrances into the building, all coming from the N side.  (With a 17) Dieter can also see the circle of runes tattooed on their clothing, signifying the Runemark.
*Dieter can’t resist. He pulls up both his blades and sticks them right through the crack in the window into the man’s eyes, one blade a piece. As he does, he whispers,*

"I know you, your whole crew, are dead men.  Dead.  Men."


Dieter appears in the window in front of the man, and the thug yells in fear and disbelief.  The second before Dieter stabs his eyes out and ruins this man, there is recognition there.  There is realization there.  There is disbelief there.  He barely has a moment to remember where her had heard those words before the swords enter his brain and cease his life.

*Dieter backs off from the window along the wall*
The others saw their leader go down, they're a bit shaken at the moment.  No one is approaching the window.
*Maouelue pulls himself up out of the grotto and moves to the door, checking whether it will open.*
*He takes the net with him and throws it over himself as he approaches the door.*


The runes are dwarfish, Maouelue is pretty sure.  Can either read dwarfish?
Even though Maouelue can't read the runes, they seem to tell a story more than do anything for the door. Decorative only.
*Maouelue tests the openability [sic] of the door.*

*Nobody expects the metal inquisition.*
(I can't...  that's hilarious!)  
The doors are slightly off-kilter, so a good strength check or a good attack could take care of it.  You cannot tell what is on the other side, however.
*Maouelue stands on the hinge side of the door and takes out his water skin. A few drop he pours on his palms, then whispers to them a low blessing. He sends some of his life into the water with his words and sends them across the room to merge with Dieter's form.*



"Oy, you, back to the boss," one yells.  They split, you lose them for a time.  One appears at the East window, the other at the North.  Both have their crossbows drawn and ready to shoot.


They both back out of the window to reload.
*Dieter begins to shrink, all at once, his form merging with his equipment, then it all seems to dissipate with an oddly buzzing sound. The buzzing grows louder as Dieter seems to disintegrate before the eyes, all of a sudden becoming...*

*Now Maouelue tries to open the door.*

*By the power invested in me...*
*Baha-mu-haaaaaa-----muuuuuuuuuuuuuut!!!*
The door comes off the hinges in the Dragon Mage's hands.
