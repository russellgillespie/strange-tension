strange-tensionTo the left, standing stock still, hands clasped in front of her, is a beautiful young maiden.  Hair as black as pitch, clothes patchworked but otherwise clean and neat, she is a vision save for bits of dirt marring her stark white skin.  She looks to be middle age, but when you look again, she looks to be barely an adult.  She waits patiently for you all to enter, eyes unblinking.
*As he speaks, he subtly examines the young woman, not fully believing the facade she presents. He has seen a hag or two in his days and his arcane senses tingle...or did that last lightning strike come a little TOO near?*
*Dieter, who has always been a bit vulnerable to beauty, unwittingly slackens his jaw. Whatever he had been expecting, this figure is not it.*
The woman nods her head.  "M' name is Bellatrix, but the townsfolk call me Trix.  Why do you come so deep into the woods to find me?"  Her eyes, still unblinking, you can see have an odd greenish tint to them.  Unnaturally bright green, reminiscent of firebugs at night or the pallor of a sickly person.  She seems healthy, though.  (Perception check for more.)


The wizard doesn't catch it, but Dieter notices Douglas acting very nervous.  He's grabbing his left elbow with his right arm, not making eye contact with anyone, and not looking around at anything.  There is so much to see in this place, it just strikes Dieter as strange.  He also notices several potion bottles ready to be stoppered.  They're red, swirling, and you know them as potions of healing.
She laughs, looking at the floor for a beat.  She makes her way to the table, stoppers four bottles, and bring them to Dieter.
She smiles and says to Maouelue, "I'm sorry, goodsir, I don't study in the arcane much.  Mine is a...  different type of magic.  Some shy away from it, but it has been with me and my family for years upon years, generation upon generation.  A curse, some would tell you.  It has served me well, though.  And hopefully it serves you well, too."  She nods to the bottles.
*Dieter takes the bottles in hand and offers fair payment. Maouelue’s eyes gaze piercingly into Bellatrix’s. He has an inkling of what she might mean, but is eager not to let on to his fellows the precarious nature of their visit.*
*He nods at the armful of potion bottles with which Dieter is wrangling.*
Her smile fades.  She looks at the silver ore and gives it back to Dieter.  "Although it is very much appreciated, kind sir.  I have no such use for silver or gold, though."  She shrugs and says, in a soft voice, "No place to use it."  She looks at Maouelue, studying him.
Finally, after an uncomfortable minute or so, she says, "Do you by chance have anything of Culver?  A piece of clothing of his?  Hair?  Something he owns?"
Douglas says, "Beggin' your pardon, miss...  um...  I... uh...  I have this... uh...  I have this trinket...  and, um...  and it... uh...  it belonged to Culver, ma'am."  He audibly gulps and holds out a small knife.  "Borrowed it some time back," he says to Maouelue.
*The two adventurers glance quickly at Douglas then at each other, then the witch, and back to Douglas again. Flabbergasted at this turn of fortune.*
Bellatrix smiles at the flustered man, nods as she takes the token.  To Dieter, she says, "We can discuss payment.  Let me see what fate lies in store for Culver.  Then we shall see what payment will be."  She takes the knife over to a darkened corner of the sitting room.  She pulls a dark cloth from what the group can see is an elaborately ornate mirror.  It gleams pristine in the firelight, not a mark or speck of dust is on it.
*Maouelue’s eyes darken and he assumes a brooding posture.*
Bellatrix pinches the knife by the hilt, letting it dangle point downwards.  She holds it in front if the mirror.  She touches its opposite...
The reflection of the inside of the woman's house fades into dark clouds.  The clouds roil for a few moments, and when they clear, a scene emerges that is unnerving.
The view is several feet away, looking down on a bloodied Culver.  His hands are locked in manacles bolted to the wall above his head.  His clothes are tattered.  His head hangs to his chest.
*The party gasps each with their own peculiar terrors reflecting in their minds.*
The surroundings are dark, dismal.  Some type of cell.  A metal clink is heard, and an unseen entity unlocks the manacles, letting Culver's hands fall to the floor.
The view follows the Culver being dragged by his hands out of the cell, through a series of dank hallways, and finally thrown onto a wooden floor in front of a chair.  The chair is occupied by a tall man, his features are obscured.
A laughing voice asks Culver, "What did you think we would do, Big Dove?  Eh?  Just tell me where he is and we can finish all of this!  You can go home, clean up your shop!"  Laughing from around the room greet this statement.
"Tell me where he is and who's working with him and you can walk out of here!  C'mon, man!  Let's get this *over* with!"
*Dieter casts a furtive glance back at Douglas.*
Culver moans.  He opens his eye, the other is swollen shut.  He pauses a moment.  Then spits blood at the  man in the chair.
