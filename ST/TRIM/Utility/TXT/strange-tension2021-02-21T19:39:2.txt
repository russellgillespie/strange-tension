strange-tensionDaran says, "Aye," and starts setting up a perimeter.  He then sets to investigating the hounds for choice bits.  Benna helps.
A few hours later, at the end of the wizard's meditation, he opens his eyes to find a small cookfire set with a choice stew simmering in a pot.
"Daran, you king! This looks delicious! Thank you friend. I will take your watch whenever you would like."
Maouelue looks over and check on the sisters' comfort before digging in to the stew.

As the mage eats, he looks around considering their options. While he had not intended their entrance into the cave to be permanent decision, there was no doubting the heat here was a welcome relief to the blizzard that raged upon them outside. Now to find a way out...or further in...
Benna giggles and says, "You like-a tha stew, eh!"

A fire starts in your belly.  Benna says, "To be honest, it's more of a gruel than a stew.  But it get's the job done!"  *Cackle, cackle*
“Mmm! Mmhmmm....”
*A song of ass and fire...*, broods Maouelue.
“Speaking of jobs, I seem to have gotten us into quite the pickle here. Let us consider our options.”
Assessing the lake again, aside from the holes in the wall letting in the water streams, there is an alcove due E in the water, one N of the camp, and another small walkway S of the group.
“Let’s take a look at this Southern route first.”
Daran takes his reverie while the group eats and rests.  Bellatrix gets her full compliment of sleep, but wakes up still feeling groggy.  Maybe due to the surroundings?  The camp is broken down quickly and the foursome make to scout the southern pass.  Maouelue can feel, as they all head that direction, that the air does seem to get warmer this direction.  (Marching order?)
Maouelue conjures his familiar again as they pack their things.


A dark raven appears on the mage's shoulder.
||"Fly on ahead. Scout out the southern passage."||
The bird flies 50 feet south, hitting a fork in the craggy tunnel.  It is familiar to the waterways above, complete with rocky outcroppings throughout.  The floor, however, is fairly well worn and the ceilings are 25 feet high in places.  At the intersection, there is a tunnel going NW, one going SW and yet another moving SE.  All water has completely evaporated here as it is stiflingly hot.
The crew follows and takes the NW route. The bird scouts ahead as they move.
The bird flies farther into the NW tunnel, then sends an emotion of fear back before the telepathic tether is cut.



This is what the bird sees just before the tether is broken.  You don't get the feeling that it's dead, however.  Just out of range.
Maouelue raises a finger to alert the rest and whispers for everyone to draw their weapons. 
“Does anyone have something to silence our approach? I’m a bit...clang-ey...”

The eldritch fire sears out and blasts the fire snake back into a rock formation behind it.  All four adventurers hear muffled shouts coming from behind the snake and the outcropping.  Suddenly, small orange creatures atop what can only be described as lizards walking on their hind legs, come out and attack!

This monster has no image.

The snake moves in on Bellatrix, since she attacked, and will bite then tail attack!

Benna lobs a vial into the air at the newts and it explodes over the first one, not doing any damage to it.





The newt dodges, and his tongue flits out and licks his eyeball.
~update






It is not your turn.

The newt jumps up and down, squeaking and yelling.  It runs back behind the rock outcropping. (Disadvantage to hit him now.)

“Lucky strike!”

Maouelue sees his conjured familiar in the corner of the cave, knocked out but otherwise fine.  There are three tunnels branching out W, one in the middle is glowing with a faint purple and yellow light.
Maouelue takes a moment to wake up his familiar then they all proceed into the middle passage together.
