strange-tensionDieter... tries to do his trick, but these mugs are covered in a heavy lacquer and laden in grease.  One slips, then the other.  Most of the ale covers you, some of it douses the bear in a gout of sputtering smoke.
The crowd goes quiet for a second.  Then a GIANT roar goes up, Dieter's back is slapped, and *three* more ales are set on the table for you.
Another big cheer, and a mead in a large mug is set up in front of you.  One of the farmers calls for news of the minecart you rode in on.
Douglas scans the area for his contact...

... and sees an obese man in clothes a lot finer than what you've seen in this town so far. He slowly makes his way over.
*He then regales them with a bit of an exaggerated recount of their latest encounters.*

Dieter keeps the majority of the crowd in rapt attention.  Some are being kicked out due to drinking too much, making a bit of noise to contend with you.  But the greatest number is rapt, listening to your tales.
*Dieter stumbles in his speech a bit and lets out a giant belch, rubbing his stomach thereafter.*
Douglas taps the big man on the shoulder and whispers something in his ear.  The man, without looking at Douglas, pulls a piece of parchment out of his vest and hands it to Douglas.  Douglas looks at Maouelue, surprised and somewhat worried.
*Maouelue flicks his eyes meaningfully toward the loos.*
*Dieter, stumbling a bit more now, seeks an open seat near the hearth.*
*Dieter, suddenly realizing he is famished, tries to catch the barkeep's eye.*
Douglas takes the nod, sees where Maouelue is directing, and heads there.  You catch him give the big man a backwards glance.  The man never looks at Douglas. (Perception check for more.)

Maouelue has been clocking the big man's eye movements.  He seems to be watching Dieter very closely.

The wizard and Douglas approach the loos.  Douglas pulls out the parchment, which is folded several times over.  He unfolds and looks at it, puzzled.  He shows it to Maouelue.  (History check.)

It is a dark blotch of ink in the middle of the page.  Nothing else, no writing.  Searching his memory, there is something there, something relating to the sea maybe?  The wizard can't quite put his finger on it, though.  Not precisely.
*Meanwhile, Dieter, ever presentational, makes a show of ordering what seems to be enough food to feed 3 men, going on about how he hasn't had a bite in near a day and a half.*
Douglas nods.
The bartender, a harried man with sparse, flyaway brown hair and a sweaty complexion, nods as Dieter orders.  His eyes go wider and wider with each additional item.  He tries to interject a few times, but Dieter goes right through with his food order.  The people at the bar take notice and start cheering the druid on!
*Maouelue whispers a few words to Frenchy and hand him the 5 silver coins he is carrying. The henchman circumnavigates the crowd over to Dieter.*
*Frenchy shows the silver pieces to the barkeep.*
The bartender, completely flabbergasted, calls to the cook the giant order, and says its to go.  The cook comes to the window and says, "WHO THE HELL ORDERED ALL THIS FOOD -- TO GO?!"

The cook looks through the partition, sees it's Dieter talking and says, "Oh.  It's you.  Okay, but it's gonna take some time.  Gimme a minute."  And he trails off, going back to the kitchen.  The crowd cheers again.  Someone pulls out a handmade lute, a couple drums come out, and a flute-like instrument is produced as well.  Music and merrymaking begin at The Pig.
*Dieter, picks his head up and is shaken to see a flaming bear in front of him. Realizing the increasingly dangerous nature of manipulating an open flame around so many people, he ends his conjuration and stifles a few large belches.*
*Frenchy steps back into a nearby corner and observes the bar as surrogate bodyguard for his summoner.*
As the bear is dispersed, you hear some groans from the audience, still intent on what Dieter is doing.
*Maouelue tugs at the elbow of Douglas' shirt and beckons he follow out the back and toward the Sleeping Sheep.*
*Dieter, his precaution ebbing away, blurts out...*
"What news of our friend Culver?"
*Frenchy's ears and eyes perk up at the sound of Culver's name.*


Even with being tipsy, Dieter can spy a couple large looking men making their way over to him.
*Dieter turns his head, looking to meet Frenchy's gaze.*
The two men cross paths with Maouelue and Douglas, on their way out.  (Perception check for Mao.)


Maouelue steps past the two large men, but Douglas slows, recognizing that they're with the obese man.  He slows, grabbing the sleeve of Maouelue.  They watch the progress of the men toward Dieter.
The first plate of food hits the bar in front of Dieter, and the barkeep says to the Frenchman, "You know, 5 silver won't cover his *whole* order," and leaves in a huff to the kitchen.  Bar patrons shout after him for service.
*Maouelue and Douglas hasten out the back door and run around to the front entrance hoping to be at their companion's back before the burly men are able to make their way across the crowded bar room.*
