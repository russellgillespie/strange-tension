strange-tension*"Hmmm...  That as may be.  It is true for me as well.  Tell me of Lord Muhlen.  Why has he not been to this altar recently?"*
“At last we come to the end of the riddles and get down to the tidings I would bear...”
“Lord Muhlen...has perished. The citizens of Oakhurst formed a fanatical brotherhood and have ssecretly taken the Lord from usss. While the daughterss sseek vengeance, I have been ssent to sseek your counssel...”
*"Very well.  You may recieve my counsel after you pass this tesssstttt..."*  
The voice fades and a small opening morphs into the center of the statue.  What looks like now molten gold ripples throughout the statue.  It seems something is to be presented.
*The heroes turn their heads toward each other and smirk, tilting their necks.*
Frume looks on over your shoulders, curious.
*Dieter takes the Staff of Baobab and inserts it into the the golden solar plexus.*
*He looks at Maouelue*
“The things I do for Life...”
Dieter moves to insert the stalk of the staff into the beckoning golden space.  Just as it is about to break the surface of the statue, Frume reaches out a hand and stays Dieter.
The man looks deathly serious now.  With his right hand on Dieter's arm, he reaches and inserts his left hand into the hole in the statue.  (Perception checks, please!)


Maouelue is surprised by the turn of events, he misses it completely...  but Dieter's eyes see a glint of metal on the man's left hand just as it dives into the hole.
The metal pools around Frume's hand, locking him in place.  
A silent scream appears on his face.
An eerie moment passes, then the fighter drops to his knees and lets forth the pained yell.
The silence is broken by the sound of terrible anguish.  Blood chills as Frume starts trying to pull back from the statue but cannot.
*Maouelue sees the fighter’s precarious predicament and prepares to placate the situation, placing his blade along the man’s wrist...*
Maouelue goes to strike!  He raises his blade in the air.  As it comes down...
Frume falls back to the floor, the blade *swishes* through empty air.
The man's hand has been cauterized, the entire wrist-nub is pinkish red scar tissue.
Frume is lying on the ground, hugging his arm to his chest.  He rocks back and forth, cradling it and saying, "No, no, no, no..."
You hear a disembodied voice say (in everyone's mind), "Your payment was accepted."
A small chamber on the front of the onyx base opens with a *puff* and a small drawer is revealed.
*Maouelue inspects the drawer.*
A book is the only thing in the drawer.  It is well made, bound in a strange type of thinnish, padded leather.
*The mage reaches in and grabs it gently, pulling it up to inspect it more closely.*

*Dieter peers at the journal, mildly peeved at the wizard for just grabbing it first...wasn’t he the one that was infatuated?*
*Dieter’s tongue flicks out in anticipation.*
Maouelue's mind is taken away to a room...  a familiar room filled with foreign, magical books and chests with hidden treasures.  At an ornate desk, a gray-haired man sits, writing.  The book is the same as the one Maouelue holds.  Words are being poured over and transcribed into the tome.  Time progresses.  Maouelue sees the elder mage return time and again to the book.  Finally, with a heavy *thump* the gray-haired mage, looking much older, shuts it an gives it a pat.  The mage calls out of the room.  Two young women answer the call.  The mage ushers them in a shuts the large doors.  In an instant his features turn serpentine, and the two girls react in terror.
He calms the two young ones, lets them see he means them no harm.  He shows them the book he's been working diligently on.  Time progresses more.  As the old man gets older, the two women grow.  Eventually the old man does not show up again and the two women are the only ones using the book.  As the time slows, giving Maouelue the feeling of finality, he sees one of the women steal into the room, grab the book, and retreat down a hidden ladder in the floor.  The other comes in moments later, chasing her.  The vision fades and Maouelue is standing, staring at words of a mage, surging green in the torchlight.
Some words are able to be read, some are in a language he cannot understand.  A portion of the tome reads as a diary, expressing the mage's struggles with deciphering the Netherese books he's found.   Another portion of the book contains translations, or approximations, of several Netherese texts.  Lastly, there are several spells the mage seemed to be working with.  It is almost as if the mage was reverse engineering spells based on the information he was gleaning.
*Maouelue takes the time and stows it.*
*They head back now to the way beyond the lord of stools.*
The party starts to move out of the hallway back to the goblin warren.  Frume is having some trouble getting up, however.
“Here, take this...”
*Dieter hands him a standard shield. Hopefully the fighter can at least wield that...*
