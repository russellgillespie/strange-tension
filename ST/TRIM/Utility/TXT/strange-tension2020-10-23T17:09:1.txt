strange-tension*Stenchy is pissed off. He does __NOT__ like to be grabbed in this way. In fact, he likes to do the grabbing.*

Stenchy wrenches away!
*Stenchy, newly freed, gives his most glottal grievances to the suit of arms.*
*He takes a deeeeeep breath afterward and feels refreshed.*


*Dieter dashes forward and takes a sweeping swing at the armor with the wood of his staff.*

*He overcompensates for the weight of the new shield and uncustomary helm and clanks the eagle totem into the nearby bookshelf.*

Before the armor make a move, it glows with magical light.  Some of the previous dents it received iron themselves out.  It looks a bit healthier...
It reaches out for Dieter with both arms, grabbing the druid, fittingly, in a bear hug.
(Eh?  Eh?!?! üòè)
_Frenchy resigns to pick up his bow_ encore un foix _and launches a bolt at the foe._



*Stenchy ruffles himself and prepares foe a devastating mace strike.*




*Stenchy let‚Äôs out a Haw haw haw of ebullience as he brings his first mace strike searing down onto the punk plate.*
The armor, holding Dieter, takes the hit from the mace on it's helm.  The blow rocks the plates, causing a great *clang* to bounce around the room.  As the hit happens, the party sees the green of the mace deepen and sparkle.  The armor, still ringing, starts shrinking into a smaller version of itself!  The armor is now approximately 9 inches tall.  It looks up at the druid, wondering what in the hell happened.  It's still hugging Dieter's leg.
*Dieter, bemused by this new development, picks up the tiny armor and tries to dismantle it.*

*Riiiiiiiiip*
[100 xp for each]


*Dieter continues inspecting the dismantled armor which seems to start growing back to normal size after about a minute.*
Combat ends and the party resumes checking on the base of the armor stand.  It is square, make of some deep black stone, and it looks *very* heavy.
The armor is a very fine make.  Burnished steel plate armor, full set.  It reminds you of the kind knights or paladins typically wear.
*Stenchy begins donning the armor. Frenchy assists him with the straps.*

*Dieter pokes at the black stone pedestal with his staff, just to make sure. Then inspects the material at bit more closely.*
It's solid.  There are grooves on it, you can see them when you bend over to inspect it.  They're really faint, though. (Investigation check.)

Dieter can't quite see them, they're really faint.
*Maouelue sighs and tells Dieter to step aside.*



*Maouleue shrugs.*
The wand lights up getting close to the base.  There is a trap on the base, but you can't tell the particulars.
*Frenchy picks up some of the runic coins, begins flipping them over in his hand, then throws a handful at the base.*
*Stenchy shifts in his new armor and makes a long noise. Which end it is coming from, the group can't quite tell .*
The coins clatter on the base, but they sound strange in doing so.
Yes, there is a heavier, weightier sounds when they fall.  They don't sound like metal.  You notice it more when there are more together.  It's close, but there's enough of a difference to make it sound odd in your ears.
*Frenchy picks up the thrown coins.
Stenchy walks over to the platform and stands on it as the suit of armor had previously, making a bit of a performance out of it.
Maouelue picks up a coin and inspects it, then mutters....'Runemark'..."
Dieter heads over to the pile of coins and begins dropping them in various amounts. The Dragon on the shield...the flying rider in the night...the black stone...could this be obsidian?*
The platform seems solid under Stenchy's feet.  Dieter is putting things together, he's on a good track.  Maouelue is pretty close to the mystery of the coins...  If he and Dieter put their heads together... (Intelligence check for the two of them.)


Dieter speaks Giant.  Maouelue has a nagging feeling that there is a phrase or word in Giant that could solve this...
*Dieter walks over to the platform and says the word inscribed on the bottom of the chest.*
The word falls from Dieter's lips, the runes on the coins glow but the coins are unaffected other than that.
*Dieter tries a few more words in Giant.*
At dragon, the obsidian base shakes, and starts moving forward.  (Dex save for Stenchy!)

Dieter, still concentrating on the runes and coins, is caught off guard when the base moves.  (One more Dex save to catch yourself before you fall down a hole!)

Dieter falls backwards down the hole that is uncovered by the moving base.  He flails down, falling about 20 feet before clutching onto a rung of a ladder.  It stops his fall, but deals -
Nine points of damage, nearly wrenching his shoulder out of socket.
"The rest of you, use the blasted ladder..."
*Dieter calls his flames down after him and spreads them about.*
