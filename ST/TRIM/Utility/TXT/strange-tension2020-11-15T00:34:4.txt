strange-tensionThe door swings effortlessly open.  Torchlight sputtes momentarily, but resolves on a mountain of platinum bars, all stamped with a seal of a foundry from Waterdeep.  All tallied, there are 100 bars of platinum, totalling 5,000 lbs.  A pound of platinum yields 10 coins.
*A gleam pierces the armor clad mage’s eye...*
Frume is slack-jawed at the sight.
*They begin hoarding.*
*Spitefully the druid pitches in. This dread chain they have forged...the relentless pull of fate...*
*As they finish up, they move to the other end of the room and look at the translucent door again.*
The orange moves as a fire would've seemingly casting shadows on the other side.

*Dieter sends a bolt of fire at the orange phantasm.*
The flame goes through the door and the barrier evaporates.  The heat hits the three hard.
The group looks into a room with an enormous vat of what appears to be lava as the centerpiece.  There is a scalloped edge with the lava pooling ten feet below the floor of the rest of the room.
Frume looks worried, but stands by the door, weapon ready.  He shrugs. "Can't close it, but I'm here!"
*Maouelue begins stacking platinum bars outside the pit...*
*Apeiter shrugs and turns back into a man.*
*Dieter pulls out the gold he has just looted as well and stacks it, taking the mage's lead. They both had business here it would seem.*
*Maouelue begins searching around for large pieces of rock that he can begin to pile up.*
*Dieter begins looking for scraps of wood.*
*They both look at the giant banded door, then back at each other, then back at the door, then back at each other, then move to the giant door.*
*They try to dismantle the door at the hinges.*
*They alternate at freezing and heating the hinges in quick succession. They weave back and forth between them, mimicking each other in reverse. Much like they had when tracing the circle of runes in their trance way back at the house of Ilmater. Something in the chaos of these moments has led the two back to their weird synchronicity. There they continued to work. One in gold and wood, the other in platinum and zeal. On and on they worked at the metal until....*
Frume tries to lend the other two a hand (the only one he has), but they're in lock-step.  Frume keeps watch for any signs of intruders instead.

*They two work together to dismantle the door and attempt to build it into some work surfaces. In one end of the lava room, they set up a long thin box and reinforce it with iron.*
*The one they call Deleter digs inside his pack for some long forgotten tools. He thinks to himself, just how handy inter-dimensional storage really is when it's all said and done.*
*Now they search about for a cornerstone. Something large and flat. Something that can take a beating...*
*They think back to moments ago...*
*The woman...*
*Yes...*
*...*
*It's perfect.*
*They bid Frumious to stand guard over their construction. He wouldn't be on any help anyway, not really for what they were up to.*
Frume nods, curious.
*They walk back around to the manacled woman and inspect the dais.*
*They look at its base and the construction thereof.*
What appears to be solid gold, or maybe gilded in it.  The woman is still motionless on the table.  A wound still in her chest.
*They try to lift the platform off its base.*
It is solidly secured to the floor.  (Less a table, more an altar.  Solid rectangular piece of metal or gilded stone.)
*Maouelue considers their travels a moment, then begins tapping on the walls, searching for any sign of weakness or echo on the other side.*

Dieter is being very careful to stay back from the woman.  Maouelue searches the area, moving his hands over the bas reliefs on the walls.  He lingers a few extra moments on the triad as the centerpiece of the pictures.  The room seems a shrine of sorts.  Or perhaps, something more?  He finds no secret spaces, however.
*Maouelue moves out of the room and back north to look west across the tile room.*
A silver Ouroboros is in the center of this room.  With his darkvision, Maouelue can also see scratch marks on the area of the base where the drawer would be.
i’m looking back across the raised/pressure plates
*The figure in the adjacent room catches his eye and he inspects it.*
It is exactly like the bronze and gold ones you've previously seen.  You can assume it has the same drawer in the onyx base.  Where as the bronze had a key, this one does not.  Words are inscribed on the base this time.  *I am The Great World Serpent. I begin where I end and end where I begin.  Name me.*
The drawer starts to open, then gets stuck on something.  (Strength check, please!)

The drawer comes out a little more.  Maouelue can see inside.  A piece of parchment lays at the bottom, and colored jewels sparkle atop it.
*He is compelled beyond restraint and attempts to secure them.*

It opens further.  If you're careful you could probably get the contents out.  (Sleight of hand check.)

The gauntlet is preventing Maouelue's hand from getting in.  A finger brushes against one of the jewels.
“Gah...Dieter!!! come over here!”
*The druid hears the yell and follows*

*He scoffs a little at the gauntlets.*
