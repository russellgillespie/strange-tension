strange-tensionMaouleue thinks back to what drew him here in the first place. A view of his final encounter with Shi’Vandos begins to coalesce in his mind’s eye...

*His old master, ever patient with the impetuousness of youth, yet ever watchful, glances over at his young charge, lost in his studies. As always Maouelue sits there hunched over his studies of ancient lore and language, his back to the window and the distracting echoes of his cohort frolicking out in the midsummer sun. He uses the latter instead to illuminate his texts late into the day.*

*Shi’Vandos knows that drive, that yearning for something greater than oneself, and nowhere could be more compelling than these old stories. Yet the stories themselves were all an illusion if one never got out of the tower. Yes, this land of Faerun is fabled beyond all, but as the hours in the tower grow long the flower of the power wanes.*

*“Maouleue,” the elder starts, “Come now, the time for reading today is done.”*

*The young elf looks up imploringly from his book, glancing back at the last unread page.*

*The master stifles a chuckle and nods. “Yes, you can finish it.”*

*Relieved, Maouleue buries himself back in and furiously scans over the final words, taking a long deep breath as he closes the tome’s back cover and holds it between his hands. He rises slowly and ritually restores the book to its place on the shelf.*

“It is time we put all of this knowledge you are so keen to accumulate to use. Come, follow me to the observatory, I must show you something.”

*“Of course, master.”*

*Shi’vandos leads him solemnly down a series of ornate corridors lined with oil paintings of old masters come and gone, old glorious deeds immortalized in radiant colors, the intricate white lattice work of the elves who built this wing of the academy lining the walls and letting a moiré of light shine in on the otherwise unlit space.*

*They take a right turn at the end of the long hall and Shi’vandos pulls a thin lever recessed into a nook.*
*A door to a long winding stair opens up and the Master defers to his pupil.*

*”Some things you must see first for yourself.”, he states stoically.*

*Maoulue looks deep into his eyes, questioning, yet obedient. He turns and walks apprehensively up and around and out of view.*

*“Yes, you must see for yourself what I cannot bear to tell you. Not until...you have had time to let the truth of what must be done arise from your own mind.”*

*He waits there, patient, knowing, for an hour, listening all the while. Then he hears it, the cry of shock and agony that he knows only too well himself. He lets out a breath that perhaps he had been holding the whole time, and follows his pupil’s ascent.*

“*Yes, my shining star, you have a half brother...my...other son. It is time you met him...but I am...no longer able to go that way. It is time you seek him out, and bring to him these words I would have him hear, before it is too late...”*
*”Master? I did not hear you come in...*”

Maoulue’s conscience begins to fade back into view, he pushes against the sensation of the dark hovel returning, desperate for answers to the questions he should have asked that day, and the important words he has now forgotten...

“Yes, I will follow you through the plane of the Feywild. If my studies be accurate and my intuition be true, there is someone there with whom I am most anxious to speak.”

“Vam, Heston, I fear my hours with you are always too short and filled with terrible tidings and tasks, yet your roles in this may now just prove the fate of these lands. Get ye hence to Longsaddle and raise what rabble you can, though if you can muster brick and crenelation, the all the better! We will need loyalty above all. Let us each swear now here upon the light of the lost that we shall prevail amidst the darkness and never despair. Let us meet on the field nigh the dark citadel ere the holy light wanes and stake our standards of truth deep in the soil, letting our banners fly to the wind off the Trackless Sea.”

With this, he traces a frozen sigil in the air, one of peace, resolution and above all, balance. He nods at the group and turns his gaze to the sisters of the craft. 

“I would beg no further favor of you two, yet I welcome whatever aid our cause can afford. We now await your blessings as the light of the lands dwindles.”
Vam and Heston nod.  "Until we meet at the Citadel, Master Mage."  Heston gives a very formal bow, Vam puts his arm out for a warrior's arm-shake.

Maouelue extends his arm to receive the gesture and bows back to the two solemnly and with the respect that is due their loyal following. 

“Lady Bellatrix, are you ready?”
The women wait patiently for the men to say goodbye to Maouelue and Dieter, then say goodbye themselves.  After Vam and Heston leave, the old lady turns back to her work, Bellatrix goes to help.  The old woman says to her sister (but loud enough for all to hear), "It's been a while since I've seen it, but I think we're in the presence of honest-to-gods *ta'veren*, Bella."
OK, ending...
The two women gather all of their progress into a few side satchels, and hands one out to each member.  Bellatrix says, "Inside these are two potions of healing, one standard and one greater.  A potion of invisibility, a potion of water-breathing, and two potions of fire resistance.  I'm not sure what else we need, so I'm brining along all I can to help make more on our way."  As she hands a bag to Maouelue, she blushes.
“Thank you *dear Bellatrix*”, He bows deeply.
The old woman cackles a bit, and shuffles off muttering to herself.
Daran is searching in his pack.  He brings out a strange metal symbol or device of some sort.  He arranges it in the center of the room, moves furniture and clears a space.
Maouelue focuses all his attentions on the object, on the precipice of the realm of which til now he had only read in old musty tomes alone in a tower leagues away, eras away. He waits with bated soul.
"I should tell you all, before we start on this path, the Feywild...  Well, time there is different.  It'll seem like time is passing normally.  But when we get back, it could be seconds, minutes, hours...  even years off.  I know I mentioned it as an option, and I don't have anything here worth living or dying for.  But you all might.  Just wanted to put everything on the table with what we're about to do."
“I am ready.”
Belltrix grabs Maouelue's hand.  "I am ready."
Giggling, the old woman grabs Bellatrix's hand.  "I'm ready, too!"  She holds out a hand for Daran.
“How about you, Daran?”
