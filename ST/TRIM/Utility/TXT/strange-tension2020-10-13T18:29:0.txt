strange-tensionThe big man is now sitting on a padded bench, away from the group, close to the window at the front of the house.  He's chewing his nails and his knees are bouncing rapidly.
*Dieter turns imploringly toward the large uncomfortable man.*
Bazad starts whining, pitching higher and higher.  He holds his hands on his ears on both sides of his head.  He rocks back and forth, slowly at first...  then he picks up pace.
*Maouelue takes a nearby glass of water and levitates the contents over toward Bazad. He shapes it slowly into each rune in the circle in front of the man's face trying to force him out of his shocked reticence.*

Bazad continues to rock, hands over ears.  He is staring directly at the runic waterscape.
*Dieter produces a flame and disperses the water into a cloud of steam.*


*Dieter casts a sideward glance at Maouelue as he winks in recognition of their classic hot cop cold cop routine.*

Blood starts coming out of Bazad's eyes and ears.  Soon his eyesockets rain blood down his face.  He's screaming and still rocking back and forth.  Suddenly he bolts upright and runs for the front door, bumping into Vam and the door frame on his way out.



*Dieter sends out restraining vines to prevent the man's flight.*
The vines come out and somehow the man stumbles through them, running like a man posessed through the streets of Oakhurst.



*Maouelue expends the last of his mana reserves in hope stopping the man's flight.*

~~(Do you have a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket, HMMM?? ðŸ˜Ž)~~

Bazad falls down in the middle of the street, apparently asleep.  (How far away is the party?)
*Strange bits of sand fall off of the dunegrass summoned by Dieter's entangling vines. As Maouelue sees the spell fizzle as Bazad gets away, and in a fit of inspiration pulls up several grains and sends them out ins a z-shaped wave toward the fleeing man!*
As you make your way toward the prone man...
The ground shakes beneath you.  Lines of dirt and sand puff and blow into the air.  The lines circle around the group, making their way indirectly towards the man lying in the street.
As Dieter calls out his charge, two snake-like creatures *pop* from the ground around Bazad!
*The pair address the snakes and consider them dubiously.*
"Thisss one is ourssss."  One grabs Bazad!


GI1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (3) + 2 = `5`.
GI2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (11) + 2 = `13`.



Rhahlad runs in a panic straight away from the two snakes.  Vam yells, "Hold 'em off, I'll fetch my crossbow!"  The one grabbing Bazad leaps down the hole with the prone and unconscious man in tow.  The other flicks its tongue out maliciously.  "Good.  I alwayssss prefer an appetizer before the meal..."

It flicks its fangs out and strikes with a quickness neither of you expect.











GI1 removed from combat.





*Dieter attacks with a fiery blade!*
The snake looks from Dieter to Maouelue, sizing up his choice.  Since Dieter just hit him with his massive fiery weapon, the snake is going to go after Dieter with...

(NO!)  He whips his massive tail, and Dieter deftly deflects the dastardly deed.




The snake roars in pain and frustration.  It lashes out with it's tail again and successfully grabs Dieter around his midsection.  He snarls and laughs while pulling the adventurer closer toward his fangs...




The snake curls its tail tight around the druid...

*Dieter takes in as large a breath as he can under the circumstances and attempts to wrest his flaming sword free and slice through the grappling snake.*



The snake is going to try and move Dieter down into the hole... (Either Dex or Strength save, whichever is better for you.)

The snake licks up the side of Dieter's face.  "I'll bring you along aaassss a ssssnacking..."
And he pushes Dieter into the hole.
*Maouleue quaffs a potion of healing before jumping down after his friend.*


The wizard, worried about his friend, slams his potion and jumps down the hole.  Much to the surprise of the snake.  As he's falling, he realizes the hole is much deeper than he originally thought.
*Dieter stands up and wiped the scut off of his face. With a scowl he reaches into his bag and pulls out his last potion of healing, bracing himself from what may come from the snake.*





*Dieter lets out a cry of ecstasy as he channels his last deep breath and releases his ebullition of healing words all over himself.*
The snake sticks it's head to the mouth of the hole.  It opens it's maw, hissing, strands of saliva dripping down into the opening.  When suddenly...
A crossbow bolt catches the constrictor on the side of the head, it lets out another roar and turns it's head to the source.
It looks back and forth, trying to make a decision...
And jumps down the *other* hole in the street...


*As the snake turns to the other hole, Maouelue lifts his longsword high with two hands and attempts to drive it through the snake's retreating tail.*
