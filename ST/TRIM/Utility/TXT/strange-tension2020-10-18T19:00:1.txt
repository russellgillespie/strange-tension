strange-tensionThe snake, bloodied and in a frenzy, snaps it's tail to throw the halfling across the room.  Whether it be the healing he just received or the intensity of his will to live, Briffo hangs on to the tail last moment, jumping clear of anyone else in the room.  Maouelue, however, wasn't as fortunate.  The tail comes straight at the wizard, knocking him prone (and dealing...)



"Thank you, good sirs.  Thought I was a goner there for a moment.  Can't believe he could see me," says Briffo, taking off his ring.  He goes through his bag and hands out healing potions.  "In payment of saving my life!"
(Add one standard PoH and one greater PoH to your bags.)
Briffo then pulls out his lute.  He checks the strings and tunes it.  With a twirl of his hand, he starts plucking a merry melody.  Dieter, you feel more confident, even lucky.  (Take a...






Maouelue feels a sudden chill in the room.


*The group gets to looting as much of the snake carcass as seems reasonable. Maouelue lauds accolades on his Bag of Holding.*


The druid knows what he's doing, takes care of skinning the beast while Maouelue and Briffo carve into the meat.  You get the full skin plus 4 lbs of meat.
*The group looks pleased with themselves as they pack up their snake and sneak out the front door.*
An ethereal whisper comes from behind the group...


Maouelue cannot sense the meaning of the message, but the druid hears it in the back of his mind, faintly.  
"Please.  Stay.  Help."
*Dieter considers the voice. From whom had it come? Was (s)he young? Were...they?...what was this aural apparition?*
*Maouelue gives a look of grave concern to Dieter that is all the answer needed. Dieter begins to answer back...*


The chill deepens, you feel like an answer comes, but you just can't be sure.  The cold seems to be coming from the vault doors.
*Dieter seems compelled. Without consulting with his group, he tractors toward the vault. The others follow in defense of their enthralled companion.*
Thin tendrils of blue vapor course around the door.  They wend and weave their way into and out of the scratches and markings on the doors, eventually bringing to bear twenty sigils arranged symmetrically.
*Dieter begins tracing them in fire, Maouelue shrugs and does the same on the opposite side in ice, trying to match Dieter’s timing.*


*They spell weave top down, out to in along the sigil lines. The flame and ice auras casting a pale light flickering between violet and green where the overlap.*
As your hand covers a rune, it glows a bright purple.  The fire and ice dont seem to affect it but your presence does, or at least your intent to 'activate' the runes.  When they are all lit, they give off a brilliant radiance, filling the foyer.  Then they slowly... fade to darkness.


This time, the wizard picks up the words... "Runes.  Four.  House.  Clues."
*Maouelue translates for Dieter and Briffo...*
*Dieter turns to the entryway and up to the north room with the destroyed portrait ghost. He leads them to the West door and pushes on it.*
You enter the 'green' room.  (Perception check for what you think this room is.)


Dieter looks from the mage hand holding the bronze brazier to the green slime on the walls and floor.  He bends down to scrape some of the muck away and sees cedar wood flooring.  He does the same for the walls, and finds the same.
*Maouelue sees this and he instructs the hand to continue wiping away areas of slime to reveal anything hiding underneath.*
The hand scours the room, unveiling a couple more bronze ewers.  But no sigils are here.  There are four doors, two on the N and two on the S.  The door to the W opens into the library. (They put a fucking sauna between an art gallery and a library?!)
*They proceed to the north  doors and peek through both.*
The one on the NW opens into damp, disgusting scraps of what used to be towels and linens.  The NE door opens onto various bottles and vials on shelves.
*Dieter never says “no” to a vial. He starts hovering them into his bag as he looks at the labels.*
Mostly perfumes and soaps.  Some look a little volatile, though.
*They leave it alone for the time being, head backward and to the west.*
*They move back through the house, through the prep kitchen and out through the east door then up to the north end of the hallway.*
The hall ends in a right turn, a door stands in front of the party.  It leads back to the main foyer.  Briffo scratches his head.
*Maouelue has an idea. He runs through the house and distributes ghost crystals into the three sigil containers in numeral order.*
*I...II...III...”
*While his companion runs around like a mad wizard, Dieter inspects the scrolls in his bandolier.*
*Dieter pulls out his water skin and dribbles a few drops ok the parchment.*
The few drops soak into the parchment, partially showing a sigil under the writing.
*Dieter full saturates the paper, inspecting the sigil.*
The full sigil appears, it is one of the runes you've been looking for.
*He catches Maouelue’s attention as he passes by and shows it to him.*
*They both consider the circle of runes they had seen, trying to recall the message. Maouelue thinks through what he has put together so far.*
“R_NEM_R_...”
*As he mutters, the group heads back into the prep kitchen and looks around some more.*
