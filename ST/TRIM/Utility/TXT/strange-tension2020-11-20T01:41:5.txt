strange-tension*Culver, Douglas, the Muhlen Sisters, Frume.....Briffo...

How many had been slain or maimed due to this accursed business? These many at least just on their account, and lords know how far back these magicks go...

The two worked with a righteous yet contained fervor. They reminisced about old encounters they had been though together before their time in Oakhurst. The one with the forest troll, the one with the singing seashell, the one on the mountain pass when they got caught out in the storm...

Somehow they had come through it all unscathed, mostly, and the manual labor and reminiscence was working wonders for their camaraderie. Maouelue spent more time out of his shell lately as it was just too unwieldy and hot to wear heavy plate at the forge. Dieter was still making peace with his fraught relationship with metal. He supposed that since the lava's heat was of the earth rather than of burning woods, he was more willing to indulge.*
*And indulge he did. They did. They hammered away at that gold and platinum attempting all manner of tricks. Maouelue told stories about ancient folded-metal blades he had read about in the archives, while Dieter regaled the elf about water shapeshifters he knew who could cleave a shield with a thin-but-powerful stream of water. It was great to slow down and spend some time together.*
*Maouelue set to making a new set of orbs, this time out of platinum. He took the mold that Saynea had given him as a carrying case, and this time put it to its original purpose. He set a bar of platinum on each side of the case and painstakingly lowered it down toward the lava, hanging  it from a spare quarterstaff they had suspended over the pit.

He watched the glow and heat flicker and bend in the platinum as it slowly became red, then yellow, then white, then liquified slowly at first, then all at once falling down into the semi-spherical molds. Next he started pulling them up to let them cool and settle a bit before he would finally flip the mold together and send it down one more time to remove the seam. After a few minutes, he pulls up the rig again and brings it over to the cooling pit, which they had built into the dirt covering the spike pit. His hands glow blue as he sends a ray of frost over the mold to crash the temperature. Steam spews everywhere as he does so. After a while he stops the ray and watches as the vapor begins to dissipate. With a cautious hand he reaches out to touch the mold. He opens up the box and sees three beautiful, pure new orbs, now made of the metal of his master, ready to be put into the line of vengeance.*
*Dieter watches Maouelue go through the meditative process of crafting his signature weapon in the image of his idol. Zealous though he was, there was a purity to his pursuit. It made Dieter think about what he himself was doing here and why.

He had set out from home, all that time ago, to gather what information he could about the great serpents of the Trollbark. His enclave had not taken lightly to the loss of one of their young kin to such a fiend, not least because it had been Dieter's hubris that had led Flipper there that day. What an impetuous fool he had been...still was...

And here, once again he found himself at the end presumably, but all the more likely the start of some new adventure. Round and round the cycle goes. He's always chasing the next snake. Each new bit of information, each new piece of serpentine lore. And now, here in these pits of poison, far away from the cool refreshing gales of the coast, had he finally found his new home? Somewhere down here? Somewhere alternating hot and humid and cold and damp, most all dark...

Yet...

He was befriended. Befriended by one of the truest beings he had ever met. Maouelue was a true scholar, and a true benefactor to those around him. Sure, he carries himself away, but isn't that just what he was saying about himself?

And what of that? This...new affinity for alchemy? The science of serpents? The particles of pestilence? The valor of venom?

Well...

If he was to defeat it...

...

He would have to become it.*
*And so he did.*
*He began hammering delicately at new bits of gold, carefully flattening the soft metal into thin plates. The tip of his shortsword of poison was put to the task of trimming out the contours, slowly tracing and reinforcing with his pocket knife as he went along. 

After several hours, he had managed to make quite a few gold shuriken that he set about applying poison to. As he counted his work, he glanced over at Maouelue, who all the while had been repeating his orb processing, and now sat surrounded by nine shining platinum balls. What a sight. What a confirmation of his belief. We are the light drake, we are the dark snake.*
*Once their respective work was done, they each lay down their tools and came over to appreciate each other's work in more detail. A look passed between them as they each silently acknowledged the contrast in...styles the items possessed. They began to test their new handiwork, Dieter flinging shuriken at stray bits of wood and bottles as targets. Maouelue was practicing a party trick where he would try to maintain the balls afloat with water he was shaping, starting with one, then incrementing as high as he could. He seemed to plateau around 5 for the time being. Time would help. Time to get re-accustomed to travel. Time to set out from their retreat. 

Over in the corner of the 4-way, Dieter picked up stray shuriken and stowed them in his bandolier. All of a sudden, he began tidying things up and shutting down the workshop area. Maouelue's concentration was broken by this and he started.*
*That one caught the mage off guard and they each had a mighty chortle. Their bags were nearly set, the workings shut down. It was time now to be on their way.*
