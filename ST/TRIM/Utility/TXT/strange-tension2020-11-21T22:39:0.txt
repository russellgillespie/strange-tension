strange-tensionThe guiding bolt rips through the room, catching the two creatures off guard.  The mage is sent flying backwards and lands prone, with a muffled *oof*.  A platinum speckled glow starts surrounding his body.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
(I guess I did.  My parents always told me to pick up my toys, but...  oh well üôÇ
The mage gets up and faces Maouelue.  "I thought those incompetent morons missed something in their hasty chase of you two.  Where's your friend, eh?  Scurry away to his hidey-hole?"







The spell coursed through the air, particles freeze as a cold of cone blasts through the room.  And, as abruptly as it stars, it completely disappears.  The mage looks from his hands, to the armored man, in disbelief.  "Shit."

The wererat hisses at you!
*The armored magician pulls the  cone of snowy air inward, then he begins swirling it round and round, smacking the two foul beings over and over in their (dis)respective faces!*
*Another ball goes cold...*



The wererat moves in closer to attack, then realized how jacked your armor is.  She starts to run toward the far side of the room, away from Maouelue.  (AOO)

It bounces around the room to avoid the misty blade.
The mage cracks his neck, and bows to the Dragon Mage.  "Good show, young man.  Maybe one day we can put your talents to real use.  As for now..."  He waves his hand and the blue barriers on the doors and windows vanish.  "As for now, I think we'll be leaving."
He drops a vial on the floor then...



*The illuminated inquisitor is not going to let his moonmark get away so easily.*

Maouelue thinks the corner is a solid choice at this point.
*And so it goes.*
*He watches and waits and listens as his pink floaty waves seep outward.*
Maouelue watches as the wererat hits the floor, hard; knocked out from the spell.  (Perception check, please!)

Maouelue knocks out the wererat and tries to listen out for any hidden movement.  His keen elven ears don't pick up anything, however.   (Did you want to move at all?)
*The mage searches around the room for something that would work as a binding. A spare bit of rope...something!*

There are scraps here and there that could be tied together.  Or vines from the baobab tree would work.
*Maouelue grabs a few vines and brings them over to the sleeping wererat, binding her up then dragging her to the precipice of the fall.*
Maouelue starts to tie up the wererat...  when...

A shot of flame burst at you from through the open doorway.  The mage still can't be seen, however.  
A disembodied voice says, "I'd rather hate to leave my hard work.  Any maybe I can add a second minion to my toils tonight, too!"

‚ÄúYes, i bet you would like that...‚Äù

*Maouelue throws caution to the wind, leaping out toward the source of the fireball. As he flies through the air, he slams his bracers together!*


The metal man grows exponentially while flying through the air at the invisible mage.  (Acrobatics check to see if you hit/grapple him.  DC 13-17 you hit him for 1d6, DC18+ you tackle him for the 1d6 and he's grappled.)

Maouelue jumps at the opening and, although he doesn't get the mage, he does some *major* damage to the surrounding room.  More of the structure comes down around the three.  (Strength save, please!)

The walls fall in, you hear an *oof* as stone cascades down and lands a blow to the mage.  The wererat, unconscious, can't help but be buried beneath the column of rock that falls in on her.  A pool of blood seeps from underneath the fallen rubble.
"You ignorant OAF!  I'll have to start *all over again*!  And guess who'll be my next subject!!"
*The misaligned mage manages to right himself.*


*The mage makes as to swat at a fly.*
"You dare use my own spells against me?"
As he's sending out the missiles, something goes wrong.  The mage becomes visible again and only one missile fires off.  His eyes go wide as he knows his doom is at hand...
*Maouelue lowers his visored visage and lets out a low growl*
"You don't want to kill me!  I can give you information!  I can help you find your friend!  I... I..."
*He grabs the mage by the throat and lifts.*
"Talk."
"Urg..   Kklgh...  Lrrgh!"
*Maouelue seeks out the mage's spellcasting focus and tries to remove it.*

The mage's face is turning blue, his hands scrabble at your gauntlets.
Maouelue paws through the mage's dingy robes with a heavy hand.  He finds a small crystal ball with a rat skull inside.
"NNNGGGKKLL!"
*He quickly stows the ball.*

"I can't hear you."
*He squeezes harder and tilts his head as he waits for the mage to lose consciousness.*
The hue goes a darker shade.  The mage's eyes roll back.  He goes limp.
*Maouelue quickly begins binding the mage with the vines he pulled previously, or more if those are covered. He checks over the man's pockets as he does, then brings him over to the precipice.*
The vines are still available.  The tree and the scar are still there.
*He looks around for a stray feather or bit of down that stray birds might have left about while hunting the small rodents in the area.*
