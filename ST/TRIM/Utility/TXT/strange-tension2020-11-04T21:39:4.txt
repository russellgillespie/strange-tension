strange-tensionThe room is roughly ten by twenty (height by length), stocked full of herbs and ingredients.  Strange smells waft in the air, the sounds of burbling liquids are bouncing around the stone walls.  You can't really make out details as the light is very strange in here, but you can see your quarry standing at the E end of the room, approx 15 feet away from you.  There seems to be an exit on her left (S) and a door behind her on the right (E).
*DD moves to block the S door*
*Maouelue makes to help Frumious jump up into the chamber as well, offering his overlapped hands.*
*He readies himself for the moment when Frumious is up*
"Thank ye, friend!"  (To jump is 3+strength modifier, with a 10 foot running start.  Standing high jump is half that number.  At this point, Frume is up for sure.  How high can Maouelue jump?)
Frume puts his arm down once he gets in the room, hoping Ding Dong can hold off the woman for a minute.
*Maouelue takes his sword out and his sheild off his back. He slaps The Blade of the Mists into his greaves and begins to evaporate!*


*Maouelue shoots up into the air in a streak of platinum mist, reforming in the air on the east side of the room, then falls, crashing to the ground below.*

Veena smiles at the armored wizard who just popped into her space.  She waves her arms in front of him, saying dark words.  A living nightmare grips Maouelue, his darkest fears revealed to him.
"What a bitch!"  He pulls his crossbow, aims...

"Shite..."
“Raaaaaaaaooooooooo!!!!!”


“Ooooooaaaaaaoooooo oooooogh!!!!”
The nightmare suddenly ends for Maouelue.
*The metal mage stares unrelentingly into the dread eyes of his next purge.*






Effect Frightened removed from Maouelue.
*Maouelue’s radiant focus begins to slip in the dark torchlight, but then, searing from the abyssal dark, the wink of a dragon ridden by a bard. His zeal surges!*
Effect end removed from Maouelue.
All effects removed from Maouelue.
You all watch as the woman starts growing a massive tail, trailing out from behind her.  It whips and *cracks* against the walls of the room.  She says, "Fine.  If I can't play with your mind, I'll play with that pretty armor."


She smiles and hisses, not noticing the damage wasn't as much as she'd hoped.

"That's better!"





The woman is looking *very* beat up.  She's looking a bit more panicked now, you guys are hitting harder than the last time.

She screams in rage and frustration.
"I think it's time to end this, boyos!  Mind yer heads!"  The woman looks strangely at the new man rushing at her.


Frume yells, "DAMMIT, DIE ALREADY!"

“Raaaaaaaaaassssssssssssss”
*The ape gestures to his pack.*
"Sorry lad, never had any.  But take a look at this!"  He gestures to the tables you can now see in bright torch light.
*Maoulue inspects the corpse...where’s the sister...he muses...*
*Dieter checks things over with Frumious.*
There is no trace of the other Muhlen sister.  As Maouelue inspects the corpse, he sees the skin is bubbling and sizzling.  Acid is eating away the flesh, an acrid smoke is rising from the remains.  (Con save and investigation check if you're going to inspect the body more closely).

The potions are numerous and multi-colored.  You do see red potions you know to be potions of healing.  There are also dark, foreboding vials.  A green, effervescent tincture. 
 A purple/yellow mixture that is constantly swirling.  All in all, a variety of ghastly stuff.  The other thing you notice is the lack of ingredients for potion making.  There are herbs hanging and a few items in the middle of being chopped and prepared.  But for the quantity of empty bottles, there aren't many ingredients for new brews.


*Maouelue attempts to stay the dissolution by freezing the body, tracing his ray over the sizzling flesh.*
*Dieter makes to divvying the lot.*
Maouelue dives into the mire to retrieve...  (d100 please!)
There are six bottles of the standard potion of healing.  (Arcana checks for some of the others.)

There are a few gems, not very good quality, all totaling 10 gp.  There is also a spell scroll of chromatic orb (first level).  The rest of her robes and satchel are burning in the acidic ooze.
*Maouelue reaches in with a gaged hand to pull the satchel out of the ichor.*
The bottom falls out.  It's contents are already puddles of muck.
*Dieter takes the vials and stores them in the bandolier.*
*Maouelue inspects the scroll of chromatic orb*

Dieter notices it's not the only one, there are couple more just like this green one already in the bandolier.  (He would also know that the damage on this one is 7d6, Con save of 13 with half damage on a save.)
The liquid is viscous, syrupy.  (It would coat four arrows or bolts, or one shortsword - or similar - for 1d6 rounds.)
*Dieter proffers one of the original vials from the bandolier and hands it to Maouelue.*
“Here brother, do you know of any way to produce an anti venom from this?”


Frume pats the ape-man on the shoulder and downs two a go.
[250 xp]
"Ah.  Bit better that, thank ye lads!  I'm going to check-see what's through this door, aye?"  He more to the small door on the E wall.
*Their lips slaver with red drips.*
