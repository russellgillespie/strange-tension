strange-tensionThe room is a mess, at the the W and NW sides.  The hallway beyond is rubble-strewn as well.  Out on the grounds, though, Maouelue finds what he's looking for.  (Take your pick, too.  There should be some of that near/in trees or in bushes or just lying on the ground.)
*He picks up a handful of feathers and stows them alongside his sand pouch, keeping one in reserve. He then drags the mage by a bit of vine he has left hanging from the binding. He throws the mage down the hole in the ground and as the body begins to fall, he whispers a few flowing words to the feather, which shoots out and flies under the falling man!*
Target me not found.

*Maouelue starts his descent down the tree, holding on to the unconscious necromancer like a festival girl holds on to a balloon.*
*As Maouelue mulls over the experience he has just gone through, he wonders why Dieter never returned with the Henchys and whether they themselves ran into any trouble that delayed them...*

*The scene fades from the Giant Metal Man with his plummeting pinion to a similar scene. The empty Baobab’s leaves seem to shuffle at nothing. The bats are keeping their distance and there is no wind down here in the scar.  It shuffles down and down over a hundred feet then a scraping sound and* **thump** *as Dieter hits the ground.*

“C’est qui la?!”, *a voice asks the disembodied sound.*

*Dieter’s shape comes back into view as he greets Quenchy and takes the cigarette being proffered. He looks at it with a mixed emotion, then resolves to take a drag.*
“Quenchy, apologies for my earlier flight. We have much to discuss. Come, take me to the others.”
*Dieter leads on hurriedly, Quency follows at a medium pace. The Druid comes around the corner to find Stenchy and Frenchy roasting a stray bit of fungus over a coal from the forge. They both are leaned in, wafting the fungal fumes into their eager faces. A few half drunk bottles of ale surround the scene.*
*Dieter looks about, slightly bewildered. The two besmirled faces turn up toward him and waft a large tuft of smoke over into his face. Quenchy steps up behind him.*

“So let’s ‘ave a look at zis mirror, non?”
*Dieter looks askance at Quenchy then turns back to another mouthful of mushroom mist. This pattern seems to oddly repeat a few times, then he turns to take one more mouthful and meets his tail between his eyes, he lunges out to bite at it, but glottal laughter becomes elongated hisses as his ‘friends?’ forms stretch upward laughissing all the way up. The six yellow eyes glisten, then blink as a silver shimmer pulls into view. Shrinking back down slightly, and looking mildly less snakelike, the henchmen hold the mirror up to Dieter’s face and force him to stare into it right as the hallucination begins to fully come up.*
The mirrors surface shows Dieter, eyes wide and unfocused, yet his clarity has never been higher.  The surface of the mirror is crystal clear.  Yet, now, it starts to haze over with a sort of frosted rim, the ice crystals crackling and creeping to meet in the center.  The center focal point becomes a tunnel, the frost becomes walls akin to the ones Dieter remembers travelling in to get to this accursed underground tomb.  And with that thought, the speed of the tunnel picks up until it feels to Dieter like he is being catapulted though a cone of ice, the end getting farther and farther away.  At the point where he feels he can't go any faster, the end of the tunnel can be seen, a distant black dot on the horizon.  The speed intensifies and the dot grows to completely fill his vision...
He blinks once.  Twice.  Then he notices the stars.  He looks left and purple nebulae waft in the distance.  Enormous floating land masses dot the amorphous landscape.  Their massive bulks house stone buildings, some have trees, others have architecture Dieter has never seen nor could fathom.  In the far distance, it looks like a magic battle is raging, streaks of red, blue, and silver swirl and explode.  A gigantic leviathan swims towards the battle, silently.  Dieter's mind reels as he watches everything pass him by.  And then he realizes...  he's moving in this incredible sea...  Towards...
A small island appears close to the druid.  It's covered in lush grass and a single tree, its branches thick and full of fresh, green leaves.  He alights on it gracefully and spies a pool of water underneath the tree.  The liquid, however, is made of a silvery substance, which reflects the myriad colored lights of this place oddly.  Just as Dieter is about to reach out and touch the pool, a thought comes into his head.  It's the though of a person, featureless but bulky.  Muscled but ordinary, non-descript.  A generic henchman, Dieter thinks.  As he thinks this, the image morphs into existence right in front of him.
Dieter looks over the generic person, thinking, *"This looks an awful lot like Frenchy."*.  As soon as the though ends, a silvery string of liquid comes from the pool and starts to cover the entity.  The substance starts at the feet, covers the entire body, then retreats the same way it came.  As it retreats, Dieter can now see the features of Frenchy clear on this man.  Frenchy looks around, smiles at Dieter, then sits by the tree, waiting.
