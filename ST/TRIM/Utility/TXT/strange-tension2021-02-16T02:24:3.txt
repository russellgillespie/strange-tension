strange-tension"Take your time! Draw that string back to its fullest now there Daran!" Maouelue encourages pedantically.

The metal mage sends a frostily debilitating blast toward the raging waters.
"Chill out man!"
The outline of the elemental frosts over, showing the group just how big this thing is.  It *towers* over the group.

It yells, echoing shrilly off the cavern walls.


"FI-nally!"
"Theeeeere it is! Nice one Daran!"

"Let's have another go 'round!"

*Bellatrix blushes.*
*The blood witch rubs her wrists in dismay, turning away from the gloating Maouelue.*
His jocularity turns to concern as he sees her go dark.



He looks at Maouelue after the bow string slaps him in the face.
"Not. A word."
Caught between concern and suppressed laughter, Mouelue turns again to the elemental, calling once more to Frammy.

"Frammy! You were right there!"
Cowering, the blood witch tries to debilitate her foe.


"AARRRGGGHHH"


The mage begins paddling hard for the swirling form.


The icy creature suddenly dives into the water, disappearing to the depths.
"Where is it?!"
Maouelue implores the frog to go find it.


"Okay one more Bella!"
The witch puts her hands into the icy water and sends out flaming jets, trying to boil the elemental in place.



Bubbles rise to the surface of the water.  Then, all is calm, cold, and quiet, save for the dripping of the ceiling and the rivulets pouring from the hidden shafts above.

The whole cavern slopes downhill towards the north.  There are rapids in the NE.

As you get closer to the rapids, the ice boat gets caught in a current and is being swept towards the rushing water!  (Strength checks again, please!)

Bellatrix puts her back into it this time, but as Maouelue is digging in, he's suddenly and hypnotically struck by her beauty.  The boat starts to spin, but gets no closer to the rapids.
You all feel one more good push will get you to the N alcove.

Benna's eyes go wide and Bellatrix yells, "Brace yourselves!"  The ice boat starts down the raging rapids into the heart of the mountain!
The ice boat is rotating fast.  As it's sucked towards the rapids and a decently steep first drop, the boat is either going to go down sideways, or right itself to going forward or backwards.  (The line-up is Maouelue, Bellatrix, Benna, and Daran, from front to back?)
As the boat twists around, dips, dives, it rights itself and heads over the first set of rapids, thankfully with Maouelue in front, steering!

Rushing water sprays up as the first rapid is met.  All of the sudden, the speed picks up as if the boat is pushed by a giant hand.  The drop is precipitous, and rocks jut out at all angles.  The light-orb hovers just in front of Maouelue, giving him a spine-chilling view of the tunnel they're about to traverse.  It is ever descending.  Untold numbers of rock spikes poke out from the walls and the water itself, almost as if the tunnel has teeth.  Benna starts giggling.
The boat plunges twenty feet down in an instant, and the group goes down a waterfall!


The company careens out of control down the drop, the back of the boat listing dangerously close to a group of spikes.   Just as it sets down in the water, a spike comes up and spears Daran in the shoulder.  Then, he and the rest of the group are wrenched away with the rushing tide.
OK, ending...

The buoyancy of the ice boat helps to float the group down the quickening river.  A few more bumps along some stubby stalagmites and the four find themselves in a coursing flow that is heading toward darkness...  and further and further down.  (Perception checks, please!)

Bellatrix and Benna are too busy paddling and removing water from the boat, but Maouelue and Daran can feel the air around them, almost imperceptible, heating up.  As if they were headed into a heat source.
In front of them, out of the darkness, is a massive upthrust of mountain stone, complete with piercing juts of rock.  The water flows to the right and left - which way does Maouelue go?

Maouelue paddles hard to the left.

Benna isn't able to react quick enough to the quick turn, and her hand gets caught by one of the passing rock outcrops.
After edging into the left course, Maouelue notices immediately that it's flowing slower down this route.  There are still the outcroppings, enclosing on the four as if the mountain were about to chew and swallow them.  (Perception checks, please!)

Growling echoes throughout the cave.  It makes it sound even more like a hungry mouth now.  Water sprays up as the boat splashes next to rocks jutting from below.  Suddenly, Benna gasps...
A group of slithering serpents bob and weave through the water, approaching the boat *fast*!
