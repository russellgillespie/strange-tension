strange-tension*Dieter thinks for a moment, then he remembers he has his mess kit in tow. That should do nicely to gather up the parchment ashes. He dares not leave them behind, so he opens up the tin box and brushes the ashes into the cup before resealing and stowing the box in his pack. He still feels oddly compelled by the amulet, but will not sully the good will of the Ilmater by taking it unbidden. He casts a fleeting glance back at the locket, then says to Douglas,*
“Let’s go now and find Maouelue...then break our fast while we consider our next course of action.”
Douglas gets up gingerly.  Patting himself down, checking to see his inventory, he frowns.  Then smile abruptly as he fishes out a few coins, drops them on the table.  "Not much, but I hope it'll do.  After you!  Oh, I'll have to stop by my rooms to grab a new tunic, too."  He stoops down to pick up his blood sodden shirt.
*They leave the building and begin walking back to the inn as they continue to converse.*
"No, I stay in a barn, southwest of town.  Farmer's real nice.  Since I'm just passing through, I wasn't planning on spending too much money or setting up shop at The Sheep.  I was mainly at the mine most of the time anyways.  If it's all the same to you, I'd like to stick with you guys?"
“We welcome your company with open arms...and if I could make a casual observation, you seem to have a part to play in this yet. What do you know about those men?”
"Which ones?!  There seemed to be thugs every time I turned my head!"  He shrugs, good-naturedly.  "The ones in the lady's mirror, I couldn't tell much.  Only know the moustache man vaguely.  Saw the big man at The Pig last night, he had his goons with him.  I recognize them, but I'm not high up enough on any ladder to know names," he chuckles.
"There's a lot of people that work for the big man; some that live in town, some that don't.  Either way, seems like he's working for someone, too.  Could be more than one person, but the talk I've heard is that Moustache is the boss.  Nothing gets done without his okay."
“I see...let us take care then not to draw attention to ourselves and our mission...though...I suppose I should avoid free ales for a while...”
*Dieter lowers his head in a show of mild embarrassment.*
"Yeah...  I never got one of those last night!  Too busy...," he starts patting his pockets.
"Dieter, you didn't happen to see..."
"You didn't happen to see a piece of parchment paper, big spot of ink on it?"
“I can’t say I have, not unless, well...there was a piece next to you on the table, but...it burned. We...there...was this circle of runes...”
*Dieter trails off as his eyes cloud over slightly and his complexion darkens a shade.*
"It burned?  Hmm.  Strange.  And the runes, are they like the ones on the coin I showed you?"
“Coin?...wait...*in the mine!* I knew I had seen their like...  what do they mean? You mentioned you were searching for them. “
"Yeah, that's the reason some of us were there.  Besides the ore veins.  The big man came up to me one night in the Pig, asked me if I had found any of those coins.  Laid down five gold, said, 'There's more where that came from, bring me more of these coins when you find them,' and that was it.  I have no idea what they are or what they mean.  I don't read runes, and I didn't ask the big man.  He's not an 'answering questions' type, anyways, know what I mean?"
“Indeed...”
*Dieter frowns gravely*
“Dark deeds, runic circles, mystical convergence...we must be wary. Fel things await those who delve too deep into the magical unknowns of this world.”
He reflects on something.  "Huh...  I would think those would be the thugs that had Culver, but we saw him with Moustache..."
*As Dieter considers this for a moment, his gaze is drawn to a glimmer of blue-white light streaking toward him from down the lane. As it draws nearer, its form becomes clearer. It appears to be a sort of fey fox. It sprints directly to him and holds its mouth slightly agape. He appears to be offering a small scroll held in his trap.*
*Dieter peers curiously at the beautiful, unearthly creature and slowly reaches for the roll. As he stretches it out, a second piece of paper falls to the ground. He stoops to pick it up and sees the message “...bring your net...”. With a furtive glance over at Douglas, he quickly reads Maouelue’s message on the larger roll. His gaze lingers on the paper for a beat, then he turns to address Douglas.*
“Douglas, ill tidings from Maouelue at The Sleeping Sheep. Pray, hasten to your rooms and gather what you need then rejoin us at the inn.”
"Will do, meet you there." He dashes away toward his lodgings.
*Dieter walks at a steady pace toward the inn until Douglas is out of view, then he turns and sprints instead to Culver’s shoppe.*
*As he approaches the building, he casts a few furtive glances around, wishing to avoid the watch of any passers by.*


Dieter looks around, believing he has been unseen.
*He enters the building and locks the door behind him. Seeing the scene of destruction again in the morning light kindles his inner rage once more. With a steely grimace, he makes his way to the back room.*
*As he enters, he surveys the scene, he is keen to determine whether anyone has disturbed his...secret.*

Dieter scans the scene.  Everything looks the same as you left it.
*He moves over to where the armoire had been and reaches out, feeling for the cords of his net.*
... he grips them...
