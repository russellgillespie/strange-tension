strange-tensionAs you say the guesses, a rumble takes the whole castle over, threatening to dump the entire second floor into the first.  After almost a minute of shaking, the house settles.  The area the party is in wasn't damaged further, but from the crashing heard after the earthquake stopped, you figure some of the house took damage.
As the party walks into the kitchen, a strange sight greets them.  Two of the larger knives are hovering in mid air.  They fly at the group!!
AN1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (8) + 2 = `10`.
AN2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (2) + 2 = `4`.



*Dieter and Maouelue are startled a bit by what they see, but they quickly steel themselves for the engagement.*
Briffo puts the ring on!


*Dieter channels the inspiration of the song bestowed upon him by Briffo.*












*Maouelue is indifferent to Dieter’s lack of appreciation as he frosts another ball.*





Briffo become visible after he throws his boomerang.  Not knowing it did that, he curses and tries to hide behind the prep table.






The knife slices and dices the wizard's arm, blood spalshes everyone!

"Damn it," yells the halfling.

*Dieter moves into range of the second knife and his staff gleams orange as he swings it down hard.*

The heroes catch their breath, Briffo goes to Maouelue.  While touching his leg, he says, "Those things were tough to hit, eh!"


[300 xp to each]
*Maouelue inspects the remains of the blades.*
*Dieter practices a few moves with his bladestaff in a corner, working on a new "wind echo" technique.*







*The group takes a brief rest, then forges onward back to the vault door. They take a longer look at the sigils, seeing if any of them match what is labeled by the ones they have found, or if any match the mysterious circle they keep finding. Could there perhaps be a "bust rune?", perhaps a "Roulette wheel?"...could it be so simple as that?*
All of the runes from the coins in your posession are on the vault door, along with several others.
The group's steaming breath can be seen billowing from your mouths now, its pretty close to freezing in the front entry way.
*Maouelue steels himself, then traces the runes in the same order as the circle they have been seeing.*
The runes glow blue, then purple, then crimson, back to blue, cycling through the rainbow of colors until with a blinding flash, they light up brilliant white.


A low rumble starts, intensifies and sharpens to what sounds like laughing.  Familiar laughing.  The laugh rises in pitch, becomes a searing scream in your ears.  The runes go out.  Darkness invades all of your senses.  Even Maouelue's dark vision is affected.  Suddenly, a dark shadow comes *through* the closed vault doors.

WR1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (14) + 3 = `17`.
The wraith laughs a throaty laugh.  "My master sends his tidings.  He wishes you to know, you will die here never learning what is behind this door."
The laugh echoes throughout the house, shaking the foundation.  Somewhere part of the second floor comes down in a massive *whoosh*.

The wraith wafts down from the stairs and tries to claw at Dieter, but the druid deftly dodges!

The boomerang flies, finding it's target and fleeing back to it's owners hand.

*Dieter's hand pulses feral energy into his staff as he then takes a full-range swing with the totem-end.*


Target sling not found.

*Maouelue concentrates the cold air around him int crystalline magical energy that imbues his sling with an icy aura.*

You do not have permission to view this combatant's attacks.

*After charging his sling, Maouelue channels what at first appears to be one normal magic missile which then splits into three smaller, weaker ones.*

The wraith screeches and lunges at Dieter again, incredibly mad that it missed the first time.  It rakes it's claws down the druid's front, searing into his soul...


The halfling wrings his hands, he had hoped that would do more damage...
*Dieter let’s out a furious cry that becomes a giant roar as his form grows hairier and his posture leans forward. Ape X Deleter stands clad in the hero’s armor and clinging to his bladestaff.*


✅ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Ape (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 12 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).



Frozen pellets careen around the wraith, battering it.  You can see wisps of blue-purple smoke wafting from the tattered holes in it's feathery cloak.  It looks at the wizard, who has been pelting it with so many ice balls.  The wraith's head cocks to one side, leering at it's prey...

A scream from the bowels of hell is unleashed by the wraith.  It turns its head to the remaining party members...
Briffo sees the wizard get clawed.  Praying that the damage is something reparable, he puts his hand over the wizard's chest...

*Maouelue gasps for breath in excruciating pain. He reaches for his greater potion of healing and downs it in one.*
