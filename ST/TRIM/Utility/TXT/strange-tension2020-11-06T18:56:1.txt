strange-tensionThey do not pay you any attention at the moment, they're too busy humming and worshipping their idol.
*He raises the Rod of Sky fire and lets off a charge directly into the center of the scene.*

The effect is...  as you would imagine.  The burst does...
Six damage to each of the fungal goblins killing...
Three of them on the spot, and causing all of them to run in every direction, panicking.
*The group draws ranged arms and begins hurling and firing.*
*Maouelue sets his sword and shield aside, going back to his frosty roots a bit and charging an orb. Dieter preps his boomerang.*
Of the four that are left standing, two run directly at you, two run to the farther end of the room where you see an exit to the S.



*They unleash on the grotesque scene.*
Like a scene from Apocalypse Now, the goblins explode around the room.  Entrails, fungus, and green/black blood/sludge coat every surface of the room.
*They take aim at the fleeing goblins.*



You *destroy* all of the goblins.  And the shit idol.  And the throne.  And...  yep.
*Dieter tries to find any remains of the phosphorescent fungus.*
*Maouelue stands like a sentinel.*

Dieter sees one neon blue mushroom cap, growing off a decapatated goblin.  Its slowly losing its glow.  (Sleight of hand check.)

As you're harvesting the mushroom, you slip on the brain goo and slice it clean off.  It loses its glow, but you can still take it.
*They step over the fallen fleeing foes to the passageway and move forward.*
The passage south opens into a 10x30 room with...  a *very* obese fungus goblin, wallowing in a mud pit.  At least you hope it's mud.  By the smell, it probably isn't.  There is a ten foot neon purple mushroom growing from this bulbous goblins head.
*Maouelue stays the hand of his friend whose rage is rapidly building. He calls out to the being...*
"Glorgig.  Glem bleh flerg baash."  His speech is very lethargic; sounds dribble from the sides of his mouth.
*The two heroes both speaking in Giant at the same time, taking their best chance, then laughing briefly about having the same idea. It almost feels like before...for a moment...then Maouelue catches himself and lets Dieter continue.*
The mage looks over to Frume.  He looks...  astonished.  "I have no fuckin' idea what's going on right here."
*Dieter’s eyes narrow, but he turns to go. His mind is on **something else** anyway.*
*They turn and Dieter begins to lead them back to the statue,  the one with the difficult-to-displace eyes...*
(I keep on doing this, I apologize...)
There is a larger exit to the room on the opposite side from the party.  One small route to the SE and one fairly large exit to the N.
*Dieter leaves them all looking a bit confused, but heads back to the junction between the burning statues and the golden snake behind the door.*
*He rushes down to open the door then heads back to the junction. Pulling out the Rod of Sky Fire again, he kisses it quickly then sends a blast at the golden figure, ducking behind the wall and into the corridor as it explodes.*
A few moments pass, but no explosion happens.
*Dieter has been plugging his ears, but doesn’t feel the expected rumble. He peeks around the corner real sneaky like.*
Nothing doing.
*The Druid is intrigued. He decides he had better show the others. He runs to get them and to show a repeat of the trick. This time he stands farther back and watches.*

*Dieter stares intently as the firework blast travels down the hallway, waiting...*
The firework hit the statue head-on, exploding.  It is a very nice show.  But the statue still stands.
*Dieter runs up to it and tries to carve at the gold with his blade trying to see if it will peel or dent at all.*
It does not.  (Strength check and then Wisdom save for Dieter.)


(Good rolls!)
The gold gives under the blade a bit, Dieter feels it give but checks again, it doesn't score at all.  There is a tug at the back of his mind, but it goes away just as quickly.
*He says a word in Giant. The word from the other statue above so long ago.*
The gold glints in the torchlight.  Other than that, nothing.
*They try to turn it on the platform.*

*Dieter and Maouelue put their backs into it.*
After a few minutes of pushing and pulling, the idol hasn't moved an inch.


*Dieter tries to remember a few of the words he uttered to the snake-stone door.*
"Open"
The tugging at the back of Dieter's mind turns into a whisper.

*"Why?"*
"For Briffo."
*"I don't know a... Briffo.  I know only Muhlens.  Who are you?"*
"I am the one they call Deleter."
"We come on on behalf of the Muhlens"
*"My name is Quetza.  I am the keeper of the Muhlens secrets."*
"Hozieh sent us to sspeak with you."

*"They have never mentioned a...  Deleter.  Tell me, do you know the key?"*
*Dieter reaches in his pocket and pulls out a piece of parchment covered in a circle of runes.*
*There are many keysss in thiss world ssir.*
*He pulls out a bottle of the venom.*
"Which would you have of me?"
*"Am I?  What did you say your name was, again?"*
“That depends what form I take. If you take my meaning.”
