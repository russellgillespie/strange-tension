strange-tension*They stumble back into the room, exhausted. Dieter lays down almost immediately.*
*He immediately passes out.*



Dreams of the adventurers are heavy, thick, like swimming through molasses.  Vague dangers are felt through layers of viscous fluid; words are muffled, faces are blurred.  All three, however, share an aspect of their dreams...  A ring of runes, moving in a circle.  Spelling out something ominous.  The laughing man from the scry can be heard every time the runes come.
Overall, though, the three spend a night in restful sleep. (Long rest and level up!)
















*Dieter is awoken by the crowing of roosters thoroughout the town. His eyes remain shut for awhile as his dream consciousness lingers on the runic circles and laughing voice. He opens his eyes slowly, and looks at the scene around him. Empty is the space where when he last laid eyes, there had been four thuggish mercenaries settling down for the night. He wondered if their...did they even have (spirits?)...if they lay there dreaming of a morning full of silver riches. He wondered about Frenchy. He reaches for the mirror just to touch something that had been part of the summoning, but refrained from looking. Some other time. He looks about the room checking over the supplies that had been strewn from the mine cart by the henchmen and setting them in order on Maouelue’s empty bed. Where was Maouelue? Frenchy...he had said something about the parsonage. “I should make my way there straight forth”, he thought. Reminded of his friends, he draws forth the runed cloth in his pocket, pondering the similarity of those in his dream. He stands there for a moment transfixed. Then, with a backward glance at the pile of silver and tools, heads out and locks the door behind him. He makes haste for the parsonage.*
Dieter walks through town to the parsonage, after inquiring directions with Denson.  The streets are sparse but the people that see you wave in happy greeting.
On approach, Dieter almost does a double take at the hovel that Denson directed him too.  In the light of day, it's barely more than some warped boards fit together, possibly not even nailed down.  A basic bench is outside; a small woman sits, lips moving in quiet prayer.  There is no door to the building.
She nods in welcome, says, "Well met, traveler.  I do have new of your companions.  Come with me."  She hops down off the bench, waves you in as she enters the hovel.
It is a small space, you see some makeshift windows on the left and right wall.  Against the back is a small table with various items adorning it.  There are bedrolls stacked in a corner.  Against the right wall, huddled in bedrolls, are Maouelue and Douglas.
The wizard's mouth is agape, nearly snoring.  Douglas is laying on his back, red-splotched bandages on covering his midsection.  His tunic was hastily bundled under his head as a makeshift pillow.  His breathing is regular.
"Your wizard friend is fine, just over tired.  The other man was deeply cut, possibly through to organs, there was quite a bit of damage.  The knife was serrated, as well.  He did not have a very good night's sleep, but I did what I could.  He's stable, breathing, and taking the healing I can give, so that's a positive.  If I can get liquids into him throughout the day, he should bounce back quicker."
"I would like to go and see about more bandages and some cleaning solution for the wound, would you like to stay while the awake?"
*Recollections of last night's drunken escalation flash through Dieter's mind and he feels a deep pang of guilt and sorrow as he looks down on the victims of his rashness.*
*He bends down, taking a closer look at Douglas, then with a steely exhale, he touches Maouelue's shoulder.*
*Maouelue's eyes open groggily, and a thin smile widens on his face.*
*They turn to look at Douglas*
*They both let out a long “Wheeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...”*
*Dieter appears lost in thought. He idly produces a flame and unconsciously rotates through the rune shapes that have haunted his recent waking and dreaming hours.*
*Maouelue stirs as he sees the symbols...His eyes glass over slightly and he involuntarily begins to trace the runes with an incredibly thin ray of frost.*
*The fire and ice begin to create a waving mist around the runes which begins to distort the air as a mirage in the desert.*
*The two journeymen lock eyes in a trance-like gaze.*


The trance leads down psychic bends, twists, turns.  Visions mentally fly by the two, trying to come together in some semblance of understanding.  Both are  trying, straining to make sense of their shared dreams.  Suddenly, the trance breaks...
And they see a piece of parchment next to Douglas is on fire.
Dieter also feels a sudden heat in his chest pocket.
*Maouelue sees Dieter wince and looks down at his coat pocket. He reaches out with his icy hands and attempts to free the now-glowing rune cloth.*
