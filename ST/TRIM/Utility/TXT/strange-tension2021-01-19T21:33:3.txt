strange-tension"Raise your eyes, youngling," the elder elf says softly.  "There is no reason to beg forgiveness; no need for your penance or absolution.  Nor is there reason to mistrust your feelings on this matter.  I *am* to blame for all of this;  for you being put in this position, for Shi'veilan feeling as he does.  However, knowing what we know of the arcane, of the weave that blends and balances, the weft and warp correcting flaws and strengthening bonds...  We know all things have their place.  Even feelings.  Go forward with your passion.  Go forward with your fire.  You could never displease me...  son.  You are strong."  He stands in front of his student, hands inside the opposite sleeves, eyes wet with emotion.
"Your wayward brother will be at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  He will be expecting me.  Give him this note.  Then, no doubt, you will begin the trials.  They are a series of tests, but not like what your brother is expecting, I imagine.  They are tests of character, not of skill or strength.  Not even of magic, although the result will get you that which you have been studying and searching for.  Take what you need for a long journey.  You can find a crossover to Faerie in several areas, but the strongest and possibly the most direct might be near Mount Hotenow, or one of it's cave systems.  I seem to remember one leading me right into the heart of the Neverwinter Wood."
He looks wistful, staring out one of the stain-glassed windows.  "Who knows," he says into the distance, "you might even find someone to share the road with you."  He blinks, seems to come back to himself, and smiles at Lumaoue.
The apprentice, now collecting himself, lifts his head now and as he sees the smiling face of his father, he swells and straightens upright, now once again holding himself with the dignity that is his due. He hoped he would never forget this moment. Though his quest was daunting, finally, he would lay down the lore and become the stuff of stories. How he had always dreamed of Faerie and all its mysteries. Ancient starlight...

“I will leave at dawn.”
Shi'Vandros, eyes shining, closes them and bows in the ways of his forefathers to young Lumaoue.  He straightens and, with a smile, leaves his apprentice to get ready.

The young elf hears the words fading “Goodbye Lumao”...”Goodby my Lumaoue good bye to you LuMaouelue Bye Lue Mao...”
The scene becomes misty as he hears a sweet music drifting into his consciousness. A montage of  his fledgling journey begins to fly through his minds eye; the descent from the tower and through the main academy grounds, carrying only what he absolutely needed, a spartan beginning for an aspiring hero. Soon the carefully engineered wooden walkways of the campus grounds give way to the deeper, wilder woods beyond. As the trees approach they begin to domineer over him, and a cold wind blows through, it seems to root him, he tries to put a foot forward into the trees but his body won’t obey. Something has him rooted. As he struggles against the sensation, slowly fear and breathlessness overtake his view into darkness...

The Dragon Mage comes up spluttering, coughing out spurts of the lush foamy water. His reverie had taken him deep, perhaps a bit too deep. Wiping the foam and water from his face he rises out of the tub, a sight to behold, wavering but collecting in the steamy washroom air. He dries himself and puts on a robe before sidling over to the day bed and beginning a prayer to his patron asking for guidance. In answer, he simply hears, “Stay Vigilant.” The Dragon Mage picks up his armaments and gets to his exercises, exorcising the foul blockages of his psyche with each thrust and shadow parry. Back to work.
There's a knock on the door.
“Enter.”
Daran peeks his head in.  "Sorry, Maouelue.  I'm headed into town for some supplies.  Need me to get you anything?"
“Let me accompany you to the market. I need to have a look around myself. What of the lady Bellatrix and her sister?”
"Haven't checked in yet."  They were shown to their room next to yours.
“Good. We should head out the two of us at once. Let us not disturb the others.”
Daran nods, turns and makes a motion to the guard at the door.  The ranger has a guard in tow as well, so the four set off into the city proper.

The open market is the first thing the group comes to after exiting the palace.  Fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meats, spices all on display.  Various artisans pose their wares, a few of them creating new pieces on the spot.  Music fills the air from several minstrels both passing and stationed in their own artisanal areas.  Beyond are the shop fronts, advertising everything from weaponry and armor to magic elixirs and salves.  A few are fairly unique shops, specializing in curiosities.  The entire city is bathed in an autumnal light from the still setting sun.
Along the way, Maouleue doesn’t speak much. He seems business-like and intent on carrying out a few long overdue bits of trade and to seek out some of the new wares he might find in such a place. He stops first by the weapon and armory to peruse the wares and offer up for sale some of the goods overflowing from his Bag of Holding ™️.
“Daran, if there’s any of this you might find useful, it is yours, else I’ll transmute it, so to speak.”

“Keep any eye out for any enchanters as well, perhaps some work could be done on some of this too. If we ever do find Dieter, he should have something of Faerie make.”
