strange-tension"Thank the gods!  The Queen's Chosen!!"  He fiddles with an amulet around his neck and cautiously moves further into the room.  

"It all started...  let's see....  about four days ago.  Large battalions of troops from the Summer Court materialized at our gates.  It's impossible to teleport into the keep itself unless given the magic directly from the Queen, so we knew there was no threat inside, however these eladrin invaders started picking through our defenses quickly.  Soon, most of the Fomorian guards and the mage range fighters were repealing back into the keep, some even went to the transport room and fled away completely.  The Queen took a contingent of her guard and touched the chardalyn, teleporting I know not where.  I've been secured in here by the arcane door, listening for more breaches of the castle walls and viewing the battle from afar.  It seems a stalemate at the moment, actually.  The outer walls have been broken through, but our inner sanctum is still intact.  I have seen others escaping via the aqueducts as well - dirty pirates and brigands, the lot of them.  She should have never brought their kind on...  Oh...  my apologies, Chosen.  I did not mean to speak ill of our Queen."
“You would do well not to, young one...,” he gives the whelp a simmering look from under his visor as he lets this absorb in the silence. “As it so happens, I am here because of that very...treachery. I come from the throne room in the Fortress of Frozen Tears, if you take my meaning. I am bidden to come and clean up the...” he looks about the room, “mess that’s been created here.”
“Your time has come. Lead on, young one. Take me to the Queen.”
The young mage looks abashed, then says, "I'm sorry, saer knight.  I can only lead you to the arcane door.  The knowledge to move past I do not have."  

Maouelue is shown doorway with a shimmery opaqueness that has taken the place of a physical door.


"You have my thanks, young one. Your duty now is to make haste away from here." He hands him a platinum coin. "Here is for your troubles. Arm yourself with what you can and now make haste away!"
He looks wide eyed at Maouelue, nodding off-handedly.  Making his way back to his chair and desk on the northern wall of the W room, he starts back up writing, with a *scritch, scritch, scritch...*
“*What part of AWAY didn’t you understand, young one?!!*” Maouelue takes a few intimidating steps toward the youth.
“Give me those, I’ll see the Queen gets them myself.”
"Wh...Whh..  Where am I to go?!  I cannot get through the barrier?"
(There are no other exits, just the arcane door on the S wall of the W room.  Roll20 is up to date.)
“One point of egress...naturally. Well, hide yourself as best you can, and *give me those papers for the Queen!*”
His hand shakes as he hands them to you.
“Your *service to the cause* is greatly appreciated. You shall be rewarded.”
"Th...  th..  thank you, saer knight..."  He backs away from Maouelue.
He steps to the shimmering door.
Maouelue bounces back from the door.  His hands come up and press against the shimmering.  The hands stop as if a real door were there.
The Metal Mage considers the door a moment and looks to Bellatrix, concealing his questioning look from the young elf.
He whispers, "What do you know of portals such as these?"
"Not much.  They usually either have a word to open them, or they're attuned to  specific person."  (Arcana check, please!)

Bellatrix's words hint on something Maouelue remembers from his studies.  These locks need a password, or to be attuned, or they can be dispelled by a spell.  It would have to match the level the lock was set at, however.
Maouelue thinks about Bahamut and touches himeslf...

*I don't want anybody else.*

...he intimates to his patron.



The Dragon Mage lifts the shield in the air and activates it.  He moves toward the door, holding the shield at the ready.  As the shimmer touches the shield, it parts, blocking off the spell's energy and creating a barrier around the shield itself.  (As if it were dispelling with a 10 ft sphere around the shield.)
🛡️
He hold it open and says, “Ladies...” as he gestures them through the door and then follows with one long last look back at the boy elf. He opens his mouth as of to speak, then thinks better of it, turns and vanishes.
Stepping through the door, the trio enters a long hall with statues lining the wall.  Right in front of them is a massive statue of a screaming dragon.  The ones on the wall are made of etched stone, but the dragon is highly glossed, polished marble.  Immediately to the left of them is an animal very familiar to Maouelue...  the man-faced dog is quirking it's head to the newly arrived group.
“Hoy Man-Dog....” he looks at the ground around... “Shit.”
YE1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (7) + 3 = `10`.

Bellatrix was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (4) + 2 = `6`.

It looks stunned and tries a half-hearted bite at the metal man.
Bellatrix pulls out a drop of healing potion and herbs and slaps it onto a bit of rations, she begins waving over to the Dog-faced-pig-man, “Who’s a good boy? Commere! Commmere! That’s it! Good boy!!”

“Where’s your mommy huh!? Wanna show me where your mommy is? Yeah?!”
The dog pads over and begins nibbling at the proffered food.
“Ummmm....Bella?”
Maouelue shakes his head and searches about the room.
He moves to the marbled dragon and sets his hands upon it.
"Whomever could you be, elegant dragon? What deeds have earned you this place of reverence?"
Looking over the room, the statues are of various elves, all in a state of battle or reverence.  Most are fully armored, almost every one has a beautifully crafted weapon of some kind barred or in use.

The dragon statue is very similar.  Very lifelike.  This section has been enlarged from the others, to accommodate this statue and some of the others, which tower several feet over Maouelue's head.  The dragon is 20ft tall itself.  

The Dragon Mage touches the marble statue, and a slight hum can be felt.
Maouelue let’s the hum overtake him, falling into a meditation on the hum’s internal rhythm and harmonies.
