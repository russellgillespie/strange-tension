strange-tension"The fact that you think you can get information from me.  The fact that, even though you're holding that, you have no idea what it means.  The fact that I got caught by amateurs and you didn't kill me outright.  There's *plenty* to find humorous."
“Oh the latter can be arranged wench...”
*Dieter pulls out his scimitar and holds it to her throat.*
Bellatrix cries out, "No, you musn't!  There are horrible consequences if she loses her life by either of you now."
She hestiates.  "I might have an alternate option."
Bellatrix looks shocked at the accusation.  Then visibly composes herself, although with an effort.
"I'm used to having people distrust me. I understand.  What oath could I give you that you could trust?  I've already helped you with potions.  I could swear something in magic, if you would like?  If either of you are able to do something to that effect?"
*He hands her the parchment and a runed coin.*
*Maouelue regards the scent with intense apprehension and caution, searching for any tell of deceit.*
Bellatrix takes the items, looking forlornly at Dieter.  "I will help you in this.  We need to finish with Veena, first.  After we decide on what to do with her, we can make time for another scry.  I will only be able to do one more today.  May I ask, are these yours or no?"

Faintly, in Maouelue's mind, he hears, *"There is much to magic.  Life and death are inexorably linked.  I appreciate them both equally."*
*Maouelue involuntarily mutters under his breath, “Yes...balance in all things...equal measure...a perfect node of truth in between...”*
*Dieter proceeds to search her for any boot daggers or hidden vials and the like.*
No boot daggers (that would have been cool, though!  C'mon Joe, write a better villain...), the bandolier is off of her, along with all of her equipment.  Didn't get her leather armor off, though.
*Dieter scowls.*
“Bind her while we regain our strength. I will take her to the council myself. I would have you come with us...so willing.”
"Oh... I...  can.  If you prefer."
“Yes. I will risk no more surprise. Maouelue, come, let us recover an hour and consider what we have seen.”
"I will pack some things.  However, I do travel light.  Let me step inside.  We require Douglas to remain... uninterred, correct?"
"He will be sealed inside the thorn wall, but the carrion birds...  They will have access.  If we hurry, it should be fine.  I will make haste."   She picks up her skirts and runs to her home.

Bellatrix returns with a small pack, using a staff to guide her steps.  The staff is gnarled, twisted, the top is a mess of brambles, nettles, and thorns curving in on itself to form an imperfect spheroid.  "All set.  I've set wards on my home.  Give me a moment to do the same for Douglas's resting place, and I will create the Forcecage for Veena.  Then we will away."
She waves her hands toward the wall of thorns, a shimmering like a heat haze settles on the structure.  Next she turns to Veena.  Her irises turn a milky white, she points her fingers at the woman.  A darkly wavering set of ethereal walls appear around the prone woman, her vine bonds drop away.  She stands and puts out a tentative hand to the dark magic wall.  She recoils as if bitten and looks darkly at the other woman.
"She will not be able to leave."




*The party takes a short rest while Bellatrix prepares her spells and seem to understand a lot more about their lives thereafter. Though still a bit tired, they carry on with their mission.*



The party makes haste through the forest and into Oakhurst.  Bellatrix says, "Although I know the way to certain people in the Five, I would be... unwelcome calling upon them.  Do you know who you would like to speak with first?"
*He scowls at Veena.*
(Did you take Veena with the group, or is she back at Trix's?)
"Yes, and no.  There is no head of the Five, they're all equally powerful, within the town as well as in the group.  There is Bazad Dunnol, the tanner.  Rhahlad Boste, he owns the coster.  Vam Stuniz is a wonderful horse trainer, he also works with a variety of farm animals, he's fairly popular with the citizenry.  Then there's Hozieh and Veena."


"Yes, I can take you there."  (If you'd rather not rp the blacksmith trip, we can just say you went there & picked up the bit.)
*The group is anxious as they approach the ranch, looking around and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of all the animals.*
*Dieter seems as calm as he has in a while in the midst of the beast party.*
*Maouelue looks as if he is bracing for a snowstorm.*
The quartet walk down the street,  the woman in the cage draws almost all of the attention.  Whispers flit back and forth between shop patrons and the rabble that roam through town.  There aren't a lot of people, but you feel that it probably doesn't matter, this is going to be the hot gossip today.
