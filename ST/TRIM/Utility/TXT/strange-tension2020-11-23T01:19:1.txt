strange-tension‚ÄúAnd so you and your...horde...eat these lies like the feces they are and that are your kind‚Äôs diet? We set out to *save* Oakhurst from him and his ilk.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you with your...special interest...an outcast you say? shunned you say? Yet you would have me believe you could lead me to them and convince them to sway?‚Äù
*Tap. Tap. Tap.*
"I can and will, if you let me go.  I can bring one to you, if you'd wish.  You've only been in the area for around a tenday.  The Runemark has been at his games for years."
‚ÄúGive me my dagger.‚Äù
*Dieter stares back, irresolute...*
*Maouelue nods.*

*Dieter stumbles over and takes one hand on the dagger with Maouelue.*
*They both thrust the blade through the mage‚Äôs forehead, sparing a retch as the sick crunch resonates in the tight tunnels.*
*Maouelue feels a twitch in the back of his head.  It feels like a shiver, it travels down his spine and nestles in his chest.*  [Alignment changes to Neutral Good]
*Dieter takes a moment to inspect the black dagger, pulling it from the necromancer's skull.*
*Maouelue takes a moment to sanctify the body.*
*Dieter nods, then moves over to the henchmen. He jostles them awake and they all come to with a start as they see his eye, keen as the day staring at them.*
*Begrudgingly the henchmen agree, exchanging dark looks. Quenchy proffers a cigarette and pointedly doesn't offer any around.*
*They tidy up what there is of the forge and pack their things, taking as much of the gold and platinum as can be carried in the bags of holding and on the packs of the henchmen. Spare gear is distributed amongst the party, balancing the load and making ready for what is to come.*
The dagger (not to go pass that up, sorry!) glows like a black light, a white halo surrounds is as it's removed from the dead man's head.  The halo glows bright and abates.  Whomever is holding it can feel him pulse like a heartbeat.
The party gets ready to leave as thunder starts rolling.  All can hear it reverberating around the cavern.  The group can see lightning flash as they start climbing the baobab tree.

*He watches as they all grunt and begin to shimmy and grapple up the long climb.*



The four adventurers make it up into the destroyed barrow without major incident.  There was a moment when Quenchy, after looking down, was a bit disoriented and slipped backwards on the vines.  Stenchy valiantly stopped Quenchy from falling too far, though.
*As they crest the touch, they look down to see the Baobab tree beginning to glow slightly, then recede into the darkness leaving a treacherous voice behind. Down below, Dieter holds his hand to the shrinking trunk, grabbing two fruits deftly from the branches as the staff reconstitutes itself. Then all of a whirl, the staff continues shrinking and Dieter shrinks with it!*

Lizard (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 15 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
*Dietard flicks out his long tongue and scampers about, finding a footing along the edge of the floor and wall, then begins climbing silently upward.*

As the Dieter-lizard moves upwards through the cavern, the sounds on wonder echo down to him. The group waits patiently, cheering the druid upwards.  About 50 feet up the wall, Dieter disturbs some bats perched upside down, causing him to shift and scrabble. (Dexterity save, please!)


There is a moment where you feel like you're falling.  You grasp out with your arms and legs, scrabbling and slapping at the wall.  Suddenly you're moving downwards and, at the same time, remember you have a tail.  The tail whips and catches on a random vine growing out from the dirt wall, and you are able to catch yourself enough to continue climbing.   After your heart calms down.

(Maybe next time üòÑ) 
Dieter-lizard climbs the rest of the way up without issue and joins the rest of the group, cheering on their leader.





(The newest member is saving the day on this one!)  Everyone is busy looking at the damage and looking for a way out, they don't see the eyes in the window on the N side of the building.  Quenchy does, though!
*Dieter walks out of view of the window then touches his ring, fading...*
There is a rustling as whatever was at the window takes off in a hurry.
*The rest of the crew continues around their respective sides of the building, Dieter trying to see where the fleeing form is headed.*

As Dieter nears the window, he can make out several campfires going, several remnants of others now amber coals on the ground.  There sounds like a lot of people milling about a distance from the barrow.  In the dark its hard to tell the exact distance, though.  He approximates about a quarter mile off.
*He rushes back into the barrow, changing shape as he does and hurried to tell the others to regroup and flee to the south. This outlet is clearly being watched.*
The group clambers over the stone debris, what's left of the barrow, and flees to the S.  (Moving speed?)

Lizard (Dieter Deleter) removed from combat.
