strange-tensionSeconds pass.  The tension is high.  (Perception check for everyone.)




The tail whips out again, this time at Dieter!  (The creature is right in front of the entrance, submerged in the water.)


The tremendous tail snaps out of the water, wraps itself around the druid's legs, and starts to pull him under the water...
(Can't pull him yet, that's a full action....  but next time ðŸ‘€)
*Stenchy has a very keen hatred building up for this beast, now fully enraged as he rushes toward his grappled friend and tries to smash the tail with his mace.*

The tail is *blasted* by the mace, and lets go of Dieter!
*Maouelue is afeard for his friend. He rushes to his side and pours the entire contents of a Greater Potion of Healing down his throat.*

*Maouelue ducks back into the tunnel entrance after pouring the potion.*




*This battle is getting bloodier and more desperate by the second. Frenchy raises the bloody flag and marches on to make impure blood soak into the soil.*


*He rushes at the Snakeman and stabs with his rapier, following up with an offhand dagger strike to the underbelly!*
*Dieter is filled with the glory of the children of the countryside and faces up against this tyranny facing the party.*

*Dieter's rage is clearly getting the better of him. He slips while wielding the flame blade and completely misses the snake. Seeing his plight he quickly mutters a healing word.*

The snake-man hiss-chuckles at Dieter's misfortune, his thick, purple tongue flicking the foggy air.

*The fighter has his bloodlust up. He will not go quietly into the night. He raises his mace overhead and....*

*Maouelue deems this is not time for cheeky balls. He pulls his hands together and mutters his incantation, a bluish purple aura begins to glow from his hands. He lifts them up and points two middle fingers and two thumbs at the snake, sending four bolts streaking at the enemy.*

*Maouleue lets out a calming breath as he brings himself back from the ether. He hears the Henchys muttering something about "only room for four giant snakes in this cavern." Dieter is heaving giant breaths and looking up with admiration at his companions.*
SW1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (16) + 3 = `19`.
*The Henchys begin singing a tune about an uprising and a bloody, rallying victory over tyrants.*
SW2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (5) + 3 = `8`.
*Blood swirls in the water.  The party sees fish emerging, presumably kept at bay by the snake-man.  They're hungry, and the blood is making them frenzied!*





*Frenchy moves around the edge of the cavern to one of the presumptuous fish, preparing his blades to strike.*



*Dieter, still reeling from the previous encounter, recedes into the tunnel and begins performing rituals of healing.*




*Feeling slightly better now, his breathing relaxes and he turns his attention back toward the battle.*

The sharp teeth do nothing against the massively armored man...








The fog lifts a bit more.  Still hard to see...


*Frenchy just gets on with business. He wants to take un nap.*

*Dieter moves over to Frenchy to heal him up and take a swipe at the swarm.*



Again with the hard metal.  They're going to swim around to find different prey...
*Stenchy joins his countryman and gives the other swarm a cursory WAP!*

*The WAP turns into a splash instead.*








You all are starting to find it hard to breathe, as if you can't get enough air in your lungs.


*The Frenchman hasn't had this much trouble breathing since that brothel back in Leilon burned...He high tails it out to the NE tunnel!*
As he moves NE, the air clears significantly...




*Dieter hurls his boomerang at the swarm, lightly grazing them, mutters a word of healing to Stenchy then follows the rogue down the passageway.*
The remainder of the swarm eyes Stenchy and Maouelue.  Knowing what they went through with the armored man, they swarm the wizard...

The quippers jump out of the water to get at wizard flesh!
*Stenchy needs a hot meal and a dry bed. It's probably not coming any time soon, so he decides to go fishing...hammer fishing.*

*He's pretty exhausted though.*



*Frenchy looks back and sees the dire straits his friends are in. He lines up a crossbow shot!*

*He hits it, then he walks on down the hall!*
*Maouelue is almost really most sincerely dead. So he follows the hallway back to return the potion favor.*

*He then gets back the fuck outta there.*

There are still a few attached to Maouelue's legs, they start nibbling...


*Maouelue needs to get out of the lair. He drinks a small healing potion then retreats.*
Combatant not found.






*Stenchy is really having trouble targeting these quippers in the pool.*
*The feeling is mutual...*




The fish, knowing they're in a losing battle, are going to disburse, fleeing in to deeper water.  (AOO from Stenchy.)

[425 xp for each]


The green glow fades, as does the fog-mist.  The cavern is eerily serene after what all just transpired.  

The tunnel you're all in runs straight into darkness.
