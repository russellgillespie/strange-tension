strange-tensionThe ice boat descends into the cavern, a multitude of other waterfalls mix and add to the chaos.  Judging the distance down at near 200 feet, Maouelue and his crew brace for impact into the fluid below.  Fluid, not water.  He sees, as it comes up quickly, that it's a brownish, greenish soup.
It's difficult to breathe now as the air in this portion of the mountain is steeped in lava ash and soot.  The boat melts on the way down.  The four are plunged into the depths of the fluid and find that they cannot see right in front of them.  It's a struggle to get back to the surface as the liquid is very thick, viscous.  (Dex saves, please!)

Maouelue breaks the water, followed closely by Bellatrix and Benna.  Immediately, they're all caught in a current that pulls them farther down.  Daran is able to land clear of the current, and he breaks the surface... without the others.  He tries to check on the others, but he can't see more than a couple inches in front of him.
He dives down once, twice.  He still can't see them and can't tell where they might be.

*A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).  When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.*

Although the heavy armor catches the water being sucked into the center of the lake, Maouelue rights himself and starts making pace against the flow.
The wizard is pulling, straining against the dense water on top of him.  (Strength save, please!)

The group meet each other at the surface of the primordial swampy lake, bits of algae float along, adrift on the sea.  They make their way to the closest edge, but just as they get near, they see...

Five hounds, lapping at the brackish, disgusting water.  Steam rises from their hides.  (Stealth checks, please!)

The hounds do not notice the heroes as they wade in the water.  (If you get closer, though, they might.  What would the group like to do?)

Frozen balls of fury come flying at the surprised hounds, incinerating four of them with an ice blast on the spot!
The last one standing snarls at the group emerging from the soup...
"Go on! Git!"

"How about you finish this, captain."  Daran readies his bow, just in case.
Bellatrix readies her swords in case the hellhound charges.
It is not your turn.
Maouelue kisses his lucky bow.

Maouelue readies five arrows, Men in Tights style, and only one arrow lands true...  in the last dead hell hound.  The group is silent behind him.  Even Benna.

Maouelue looks around at the frozen bloody bits of hellhound sinew scattering the area. He chuckles slightly and looks around at his companions. "Well, that was nine hells of a run! Glad to be warm and safe at last! Perhaps we should take a rest and gather ourselves here."


The crew looks for a secure place to rest, and they try to attune to which direction the heat seems to originate from.
The group is able to remove themselves from the disgusting stew.  Once they move the dead hound bodies, they are able to find a sufficient corner to rest in, decently secure in their safety.  (Short/long rest?)
Maouelue looks with concern at the sisters. Bella having lost her magic and Benna...well, Benna was anyone’s guess, but though she seemed to enjoy the rapids ride, she certainly could do with some down time. Maouelue looks at Daran. “Let us set up camp again here for the...whatever time it is. Daran, could you take the first watch while I recover my mana?”
