strange-tensionThe smell of smoke and fire overtake Maouelue's senses.  An acrid, acidic taste hits the back of his throat, and he gags, inhaling even more of the phantom remnants of imagined flames.  His body temperature rises instantly and Maouelue is overcome with heat, causing his armor to heat as well, burning to the touch.  A powerful voice overtakes his mind, adding to the pain and chaos of the situation.

"*You* are not the Queen.  Where is she?  When will my torment end?"


Maouelue feels that this voice, if it were embodied, would like to do harm to everything and everyone.  Then his mind flashes back to the wizard trapped in the dungeon.  And the shadow dragon shut up there as well.
He staggers back, reeling and attempting to maintain his balance in light of the horror. He should be more careful with his communion henceforth.
The voice stays with Maouelue, the feel of the flames, the false smoke he inhales with every breath.  

"I asked, *WHO* are *YOU*?"
“I am Lumao. And I am here for your Queen.”
"Hmmph.  She's not my Queen, Lumao.  She, along with a *very* long list of offenders, have trapped me in this hell...  this...  limbo.  One which, even with all of my considerable powers, I cannot undo.  Find a way to destroy this cage I am in, Lumao, and I will grant you treasure and power beyond your every desire."
"I already have a dragon patron, one of pure radiant life, light that would scour your darkness from this realm. No, I think you are here for good reason."
The growl resounds around the mages brain...  
(Constitution saving throw, please!)

The ringing abates slightly, but does not go away.  The growl turns into a roar, and at the pinicle, the dragon says, "Today I add Lumao on my list of enemies to *vanquish* upon my GLORIOUS return!"  

And with that, he fades from Lumao's mind.   The marble phases out to the group's eyes, almost as if a blur spell had been cast on it.  As quickly as it comes, it goes.  Bellatrix, Benna, and the Man-Faced-Dog(tm) all look at the mage curiously.
Shaken, he turns to the others. “Let’s move.” He offers nothing else.
The group looks around for signs of exits.  There is a doorway E, leading to the crystal room.  There is a doorway NW, and another straight S, leading out of the hall of statues.
They head NW to the door and peer in.


Maouelue grips the side of the wall as he peers into the next room.  An edge of a block of stone is just slippery enough to make the mage's armor *scrape* and a large face turns in his direction.

As the behemoth gets blasted by the green energy beams from Bellatrix, it falls with a roar and a *thud*.  In the quickening quiet, Maouelue can now hear voices shouting to the N of their fighting.

The crew moves over to the Northeast portal and takes a peek through into the room beyond.


As the trio make their way through the area, they keep hearing echoing voices, urgent and wary.  The fighting has called people - the question is, who?  The group makes its way out of the small passageway connecting the contoured stone block rooms to an open cave system surrounding the structure.  Just to the right of them, as they ease out into this new area, a wooden pen can be seen.  Within, a monstrous creature with an orange-amber carapace, a long tail with a viscous looking barb on the end of it, six spindly legs, and two massive clawed arms jutting from it's front.  It is using the claws to hack at the wooden beams of the pen, looking for a way out.  Farther into the cavern, more yeth hounds can be heard, yipping.  

Around the corner, movement...  Then...
An arrow comes out of the area just beyond the pen, arcing at Maouelue!



“On your guard!”
“Draw weapons!”

You must start combat with `!init next` first.


A glistening reddish black shield forms around the witch’s skin, giving it an eerie sheen like that of fresh blood.
She urges Benna to hide herself behind a statue or corner to avoid incoming arrows and Tucker herself behind her...battle-mage-archer-dragon-knight in shining armor.
It is not your turn.
Two more arrows come out of the black space beyond the pen, arcing over the snapping behemoth inside.


An arrow just catches Bellatrix where the mage armor doesn't quite cover, doing some significant damage.
Maouelue moves forward and brings his hands together, a rime of frost forming on his hands. He shouts out, "How cool is cool?!?" The rime then seems to dissolve from his hands, creeping around the bow arm of the attacking archer.
