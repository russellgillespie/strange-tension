strange-tension"Well met and well found indeed!  The war goes well, it seems we've just breached the main hold.  I was hoping you could tell us more of the Queen of Air and Darkness - we have not been able to find her.  Our magics are clouded as to her whereabouts as well, so we had hoped to find her here.  If you're asking, I can only assume she's eluded you too.  No matter, we will scour this keep and then burn it to the ground!"  The contingent she's with yells heartily and fans out, scouting other corridors bending around.  A large group pass by into the heart of the stone rooms, searching and continuing the fight.
"Have you completed your tasks, Dragon Mage?  Or do you wish to go back to the Court?  Once there, we can debrief you more on the war efforts."
"The Pale Prince has fallen. We were teleported here by means of an enormous chardalyn crystal as foretold. It would seem our intelligence has been our boon. I would have those with an eye for the arcane follow me to the chamber straightway."
"It will be done."  She gives a small bow, turns to the group of seelie eladrin streaming in.  Finding someone, she calls to them, brings them over and says, "Illafaera will assist you with your arcane needs.  She is has been instrumental in taking the keep back.  If you need any more aid, please don't hesitate to have a runner come find me.  It is good to see you both."  She gives a small smile, then jogs south, shouting more commands.

Standing demurely in front of the pair is a tall, willowy summer eladrin, bright gold skin shimmering in the pale light of the underground castle.  Her long blonde hair hangs loose, all the way down to her waist, but it is as thin and wispy as spider silk.  Her large golden eyes look upon Maouelue with a mix of wonder, awe, and resignation - the Dragon Mage is having a tough time reading her emotion.  She waits, swaying slightly, her white-gray robes wafting in an light breeze.
"Your radiance..." Maouelue says as he bows perhaps a little too grandiosely for Bellatrix's liking. She interjects with a poorly disguised cough of annoyance.
"If you would, we have found one of the great chardalyn crystals that the Queen's champions have been using. I would have you investigate its arcana. Perhaps it could be of use to our cause..."
She bows her head, letting her lead you to the crystal.
A short walk, just past the creepy dog, the group meets around the chardalyn, which a few other eladrin have found as well.  All stare in awe at the massive crystal jutting from the center of the floor.  (Investigation, perception, and arcana checks, please!  Arcana with advantage, because of Illafaera.)



"It seems there are...  spells locked into this crystal," the blonde eladrin says, turning her over-large golden eyes upon Maouelue.  

As the wizard takes his time to investigate the crystal, he notices a few very curious things.  First, it nearly mimics the one in the Pale Prince's throne room...  almost exactly.  Almost as if they were the same piece.  The floor does look torn away at the base of the object, and it does look as if the crystal was growing from beneath the keep itself.  There has been several protection charms cast on the chadralyn, mainly to bolster it's flimsy character.  A piece this large, though, could be very hale.  With the charms, it might be indestructible.  

There are several spells stored inside - teleportation, transmutation, communication, even a few divination spells.  There is one, however, which is strange.  As Maouelue peers deeper and deeper into the shard, he notices a light inside of it, beating as if it were a heart.

Two of the soldier eladrin, who seem to be taken in a trance-like state, reach out to touch the shard.  A small, soft voice flits in and out of Maouelue's consciousness, saying, "Touch the crystal.  It will give you powers beyond your wildest dreams..."   Maouelue notices several others turning to one another, apparently hearing the voice as well.
"STAY YOUR HANDS!!! HEED NOT THIS SUCCUBUS' TREACHERY!!!"

The soliders break out of their trance and stare at Maouelue, then each other, blankly.
"Surely it could only be her...though there was this hag..." He takes a moment to recount his combat with the crone.
"Fascinating.  And she just...  disappeared?  Where could she have gone?  And what are we to do with this...   chardalyn, did you call it?"
"Is there aught we can do to break the barriers? Have any of you any Dispel Magicks?"
"I can, and at a fair level, but I'm not sure that would eliminate this...  problem.  I fear it is a more physical approach that we need."  She stares up at the crystal, it's topmost points piercing the ceiling.  Illafarea steps back, ushers others to do the same with a movement of her hand, and then points her hands toward the chardalyn crystal.  Her fingers start to shimmer, a spell is directed towards the shard.

The room reverberates with the casting, causing a few to step back from the central figure in the room.  A blue-silver beam emanates from Illafaera, is thrown out at the shard... but nothing happens.   The crystal is not affected.
The Metal Mage mulls this over for what seems like a week, rifling through his bag, looking for anything that might be of assistance.
