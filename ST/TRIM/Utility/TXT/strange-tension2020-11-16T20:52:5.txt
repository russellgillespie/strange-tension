strange-tension*Maouelue picks up the shovel and hurls it up toward Dieter.*
*Dieter grabs it and begins shoveling dirt from the edge and tossing it down, covering up the spikes. Maouelue works in turn trying to cover up the spikes and chip away at the NE wall, building up again from there.*
*They do this for hours.*
*They are in a bit of a fervor.*


Dieter takes a point of exhaustion, working so hard.  (Maouelue is getting beefy ever since he upgraded a cleric level!)

*Dieter was raised on a coastal inlet in a semi-tropical biome. Perhaps somewhere a bit to the south. His people lived on the edge of a great forest that pushed deep into the mainland beyond. In the far distance, mountains could be seen rising high above the darkest reaches of the deep jungle. 

The people lived off the land, or rather...they lived* **with the land.** *They spent their days tending the dune-grasslands, harvesting local flora and nurturing fauna and pollinator alike. The community understood the nature of things and thus did not shy away from eating meat, yet there was great reverence whenever it was hunted, processed, and consumed.

The sea was the standard place of play for the children of the coast. They would run and laugh about, finding starfish and crustaceans along the surf line. The older fellows would venture deeper out into the waters, and when the conditions were right, you could see them shifting shape with the waves, alternately becoming leaping dolphins, then giant sailfish, each adolescent trying to outdo the next. Then...inevitably they would irritate some local Greatfish and an elder would whale over to them for a condemning escort back to the encampment.

Dieter would watch and sometimes play with the children in the surf, but really, he always looked longingly at the mountain, rising so high above the horizon. Somehow, the forest seemed so much more formidable than the sea. You could see the sea, but you see, the forest sees you...

At times he would coax an older boy or girl to take him out into the woods a bit. They would gather and forage, sometimes running as rabbits or squirrels through the woods. Sometimes they would become insects and inspect the insides of trees. They always tried to have someone there to help in case they needed a quick rescue, but things didn't always go as planned...*
*One day, when Dieter couldn't find one of the older fellows, he coaxed his friend Flipper into coming with him for a forage into the forest. The young druid boy was often quite adventurous when he swam at sea. He could often be seen flying high across the shallows as he would zoom and leap across the sunset in great arcs. Flipper was built for speed in the smooth fluid environment of the water. The thicket they found themselves in as they left the dunes and headed into the forest that day was not so relenting...

On a recent foray into this area Dieter had seen a glimpse of something green glowing deep in the jungle. He didn't mention this to Flipper, but he* **needed** *to find out what it was. Flipper moaned and yipped a bit about the thorns pulling at his smooth, scaly skin, only to be hushed by Dieter as they pushed further in, leaving the daylight behind and moving slowly forward into the obscured streaks of light under the canopy.

A little ways further in, Flipper and Dieter looked up in awe...
Hundreds of birds of all colors and sizes were swooping above them in glorious glides from one gargantuan Greattree to the next. Monkeys and other small mammals flung themselves from branch to branch to vine and back. It was indeed a sight to behold, and worth the tough slog they had made thus far!*
