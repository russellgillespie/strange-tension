strange-tensionFrume follows, painfully.  The party goes twenty more yards and the link comes back to Mouelue.  The bat is hanging upside down outside of an entrance to a cave opening.
"No, no.  Gotta take the good with the bad, eh?"  He takes a swig from a flask, but other than that, he's following behind dutifully.






Updated and saved data for The Frumious Bandersnatch!

Dieter walks down the SE passage.  About forty feet or so down, Dieter sees a goblin covered in dirt and feces.
*He stops to consider the goblin a moment and listen.*
It chitters away to other goblins.  Dieter can't see the others but he can hear them.  They're really loud.  And really disgusting.
*Dieter tries to pick out how many individuals he can hear.*
*He looks at the bat meaningfully as he does so.*

There are about six goblins that he can pick out.  There might be more beyond, but the immediate area has six.
*Maouelue directs the bat to try and pull just the first goblin's attention while Dieter lines up an invisible sneak attack with his boomerang.*
*Maouelue stands a bit back from the entryway while sending Frumious up to line up a ranged strike as well.*
Frume nods, gets into position.  The bat flits back to the goblins by Dieter.  It flies through the goblins, trying to distract it.  (Dex save for the bat, attack roll with advantage for Dieter.)


The bat *poofs* as the goblin by Dieter swipes at him.  As it disappears, the goblin hears a *clunk* of wood hitting the wall of the tunnel right by it's head.  It looks around...

The goblins all rush to the aid of the first goblin, who gets wrecked by a bolt from Frume.
*Dieter dives into the battle and spins his relic weapon in a furious, cleaving arc!*



The goblin *explodes*!
*The metal mage strides up, slinging his shield over his back and gripping his sword in two hands.*




Target g04 not found.



The last goblin flees down the tunnel...
*Dieter runs after it, picking up his trusty boomerang on the way and flings it at his quarry!*
"For the moment.  I could use me a breather already!"

*The sentinel marches forward and raises a cold hand.*

Frume races after thr goblin, hot on Dieters tail.  The tunnel weaves around amd around.  Suddenly, a fork comes up, amd the two stop abruptly.
Dieter deliberates diligently.  Determined to doused the dreaded devils, he dashes down...  the left corridor.  It's a good move, because the one on the right *stinks* to high heaven.
Frume follows with a newly lit torch.
*Maouelue follows his companion...to the left.*
The party moves further and further into the cave system.  The tunnel twists and bends, moving steadily downward all the time.  Further the descend and travel.  Dieter notices, at the edge of the torch light, that the tunnel ends.



The wizard is the only one who sees the glint of metal above you all.
*Thinking quickly the wizard sends a bolt of energy in its direction!*

With a flash and a humongous *BANG* the trapdoor *EXPLODES* upward, causing a rain of metal, rock, and dust to fall in on the heroes.  No damage is done, but I'm afraid...
Once the dust settles, two female faces stare down at the party from the hole where the trap door had been.  Brightened by the torch flames and backlit by the strange lighting of the chamber they're in, Veena and Hozieh Muhlen stare down at the group in disbelief.
GO4 removed from combat.

YU1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (**20**) + 2 = `22`.
Veena says something to her sister.  Hozieh nods and backs away from the opening.
"Come on up, boys.  Let us have some more fun.  Ha Ha HA!!!"
It is not currently anyone's turn.

The lights in the area change and shimmer.  They all turn to a black-light version of themselves.  Almost as if each light is a miniature black hole, they seem to drawn in light rather than emit it.
No matching spells found in the combatant's spellbook. Cast again with the `-i` argument to ignore restrictions!

Frume looks at the two of you.

"Friend of yours?"

✅ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Ape (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 6 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
*Ding Dong leaps up high and straight grabbing the edge of the trap door, then vaults up into the room staring at the scene.*

“Aaooooooo Aaoooooo!!!”
(Oh, yeah.)  Perfect three point landing as he vaults through the door.
