strange-tension*Maouelue tilts his head and hisses back. His hands start to crackle then turn bluish white. He raises them and points them directly at the maw!*

*His spell fizzles...*




CA1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (4) + 1 = `5`.


The thing *squeals* as it's hit.
*Frenchy, lurking invisibly by the door, lines up a crossbow shot directly at the maw.*

*Stenchy, considerably less stealthily, picks up his crossbow and aims it at...whatever this fucking thing is.*


*Dieter, seeing the beast flailing above, throws his trusty boomerang +2 at the slug and splits Frenchy's bolt in twain!*
The thing tries to scamper higher, but it's getting hit by all of these attacks.  It squeals again, as it gets hit with the boomerang, loses it's grip on the ceiling, and falls, screeching, to land *flump* on the cold ground.

The sounds of it's death cry reverberate around the cavern...
[75 xp]
The sounds compound.  Larger sounds join them.  Sounds of something large... rolling, skittering, crawling.  (Perception checks for all, please!  And nature checks, too, if you'd like!)










The three in the middle of the room are scared, hearing movement above them, all around them.  Strange sounds bring them to the height of panic.  Maouelue sees above where the creature was clinging to the wall, a hole begins.  Out of it, a massive head pokes out.   This creature is at least three times as large as the thing they just massacred.
As the head and body continue writhing out of the hole, making it's way down the wall, *another* head pokes out...   this one even larger than the last...
CA2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (3) + 1 = `4`.
CA3 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (18) + 1 = `19`.
As the thing crawls down the wall, it pauses at the body of it smaller member.  It lets out a screech and a cry that rattle the walls, then stares at the wizard.  (The roar will be one action, they each have two attacks they can make.)




The carrion crawler moves down the wall, searching prey out with it's snoot.  It latches onto Maouelue's scent, and also senses the group not too far way from him.  He can't quite reach the wizard (in melee), so it's going to lash out with its tentacle...

The wizard gets *slapped* by the dripping tentacle, feels the burn of the poison, but staves it off to fight on.

*Stenchy misses with a crossbow bolt, then moves toward the wall between the opening and Maouelue.*
*Stenchy trundles over to the crawler currently engaged with the wizard.*

*Dieter is keeping his distance for now. He goes over to guard French and sends his boomerang at the engaged worm.*




The crawler mauls into the two people in front of it, slavering rows of teeth crunching on the wizards arm.


The gaping maw closes in on the wizard.  At the last minute, it's stopped by something, clangs against it again, but can't get close to the wizard.  (Great move!)


The big mamma-jamma opens it's maw and goes after the wizard again!


It roars and tries to back away.  (Out of melee, since you already used a reaction, you aren't able to get an AOO.)
*Frenchy lines up another bow show on the big mudda.*

*He hangs his head in shame.*



✅ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Ape (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 9 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
*Dieter apes out.*
The crawlers are starting to get enraged...


It roars in anger!

(Whoa with the nat ones!

*A song stirs in Maouelue’s mind’s ear...For Briffo!*


This crawler disengaged and was going to move to the other group firing long range at it.  It rushed and attacks!


It whips out with it's attacks, flashing serrated teeth in circular rows around it's disgusting mouth.

*Frenchy fades into fog.*
The creature is startled to see the thing it just bit vanish.
*Stenchy’s last six seconds have felt like a day...he feels ready to strike...something...anything...with his mace.*

*Apeiter rages out on the nearest crawler.*


Green blood sprays from the slimy creature, splattering the floor, sizzling as it hits.


It roars in rage!

You could swear you hear one on the things laughing...  Must be your imagination...

It tries to bite the thing that was just in front of it, but it can't find it.  Enraged, it turns it's attention to the ape-man...

It roars with ineptitude!
*Frenchy has been sneaking away in fear for his life towards the cavern entrance in case they need to flee. He takes his time lining up a sneak attack on the large worm.*

*Stenchy spits on his hands, brushes his shoulders off, does a little shimmy...and picks up his mace.*

*Apieter bangs on his chest with both fists and lets out a primal howl.*


*On second thought, he should have just gotten on with things, as it seems the howl alerted the crawler of what was coming.*
The ape gets close enough to see the beady eyes of the beast.  It snarls...

And coughs on something it ate earlier.  A partial hand comes flying out of it's mouth, hitting ape Dieter in the face.

It might be starting to choke on it's prior food...
