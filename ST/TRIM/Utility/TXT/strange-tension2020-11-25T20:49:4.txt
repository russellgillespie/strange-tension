strange-tension*The two take their modes of invisibility and fan out to the edges of the party for scouting. They carry on Southward trying not to make too much noise, but being as swift as they can.  The clang of the armor is just a matter of fact at this point for the travelers. They try to find cover.*






*Maouelue scans...*


As Dieter says this to Maouelue, both invisible people see three men walking around the side of the building, searching.  (They haven't spotted you all yet, but they're on the verge. You'll have a surprise round if you want it, or you can run for it, put some distance between everyone.)
*The invisible members try to push out and get a look at the newcomers as the rest ready ranged attacks for when they come into view, should they be assailants.*

*Dieter channels the fury of the storm and slashes out at the three scoundrels!*
*Frenchy throws the net aside and strikes with two ferocious thrusts!*
The wave hits, in more ways than one.  The thug in the rear takes both of Frenchy's slashes, then gets pummeled by a wash of water, that he somehow withstands.  The others weren't so lucky.  A quick slash and a burst of a wave throws both of them back, sending thug #2 into the broken bits of the brickwork behind him.
(Nice turn!  Anything else?)
Thug 1 is going to get up from prone, put a whistle in his mouth and blow a high-pitched note, then he'll ready his mace for an oncoming attack.

*The now leather-clad fighter is unburdened by the heavy armor that seemed to throw his weight around unpredictably in the caves before. He brings the mace around hard and true!*
"OOoofff!"




*The french rogue strikes true on his engaged combatant, casting him aside, then lunges wide of the leader.*



Frenchy hears hoofbeats coming closer.


*The mage shoots a blast of frost then recedes into the trees.*
Resigned to his fate, the thug swing wildly, trying to hit either Frenchy or Dieter.


*They dash for the woods.*





The horses come from the N, the clacking of their hoofs on the stone sound like small explosions.  The group tries to tear over to the trees, but a couple of them are spotted by the lead rider.
"Full attack, men!  No prisoners!"
TH3 was added to combat with initiative 9 as part of group Riders.

Updated and saved data for Quenchy!

*The range shoots then continues fleeing to the trees.*
The horse takes a bolt to the chest, nearly bucking the rider off.
*Catching a whiff of valor from his compatriot, Frenchy turns and dives toward the horses, pulling his weapons across their charging flanks!*



As big as the horse is, Frenchy is imposing his will and making the horse stop in it's place.  Blocking the way for the other.  The group can hear them yelling at each other.




*Dieter pulls out a shuriken with either hand in a crossing gesture against the bandolier on his chest. He flings his hands outwards!*


*He misses. Badly. With both.*

"I have to stop letting vengeance get in the way of rest..."


The lead horse goes down, the rider jumps.





The vicious rapier slices through the throat of the horse, felling it in one.  The thug tries to hop off while it goes down.
He's upright, and now facing Frenchy.
The other one sees the lead thug still blocking his path and he starts swearing a blue streak.






*The Druid pulls his water skin out and drips a single drop into the air. He immediately begins coaxing it with his voice and hands as it extends out into the room as a gigantic tidal wave!*
Dieter yells for Frenchy to dive back, and the thug swings at him while he jumps away...

The frustrated thug decides to charge past his comrades, inciting yells from the leader.  Dieter holds his ground and cuts down the horse, sending the rider flying.
The rider flies and falls just behind Stenchy, now off his mount.






More riders are coming from the north.







*Laying low the first two horsemen, Maouelue and Stenchy lead the retreat into the wood.*


The two remaining move in to position around Dieter, bringing their maces out and quick wrapping their wounds.  (Two mace attacks on Dieter.)
(Oh, and perception for Stenchy, please!)




*The Druid's form begins to flicker and shift in the glints between the two assailants, he fades, flickers, refracts, until there are now four Deleters!*




*Missiles come flying fast and furiously from the fetid forest. The penultimate pursuer perishes pathetically.*

*Another snipe from the shadows...*
