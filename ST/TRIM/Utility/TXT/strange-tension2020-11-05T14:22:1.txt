strange-tensionFrume opens the door easily.  This is a storage closet.  Ingredients by the crateful are stocked in here.  (Anything you need to stock up on, component-wise, would be in here.  Feel free to rp it!)
*As they walk into the store cupboard, they are overwhelmed by a pungent aroma ride with all the lichens and fungi and...bless my word...*
“Ah the smell o the salt sea and the green ground cover under the trees. The warmth of a fair maiden on your chest...a hint o the town’s finest on the lips...”
“We told tales of the green dragon and pictured it out over the cliffs, rising and diving...we played at all manner of magicks there on the sheer...”
*Maouelue sets his helm aside a moment and grins at his friend. With the face guard down, Maouelue regains a bit of his old demeanor and goes to give Dieter a hearty slap on the back, just realizing at the last moment he still wore a sturdy gage and stopping himself, his smile fading slightly.

He takes a professionally curious glance at several of the assorted pastes, cross sections, and nuggets. He waved a hand glowing so blue as almost to be white over each in turn, seeking the forces of healing within.*
*As he does so, he beckons to Frumious and bids him to scout the corridor.*
Frume nods and exits a south door, leaving it open.  There are enough ingredients to make about 2d10 standard potions of healing, or 2d4 superior potions of healing.  (You would need an herbalism kit to prepare potions.  A proficiency in it will let you add your proficiency to the roll to make anything.  Expertise will get you advantage on top of that.)


*Dieter comes out of ape form in a whirl of fur and leather. He delicately begins setting ingredients aside to concoct some of the solutions listed in his kit. He draws on everything he knows about the subject and the strange healings of the places where rock meets the sea.*
*As he works the bench, he fiddles with a bit of the shamrock and mistletoe, grinding them into a pulp and rubbing down the sides of the workspace, sending a greenish yellow glow throughout the wood. He hums a reel as he works.*
"The luck o the threes lads!"
"The threes!"
It takes three hours, the workspace is very well set up, if a little grim. The equipment, you can tell, is used for poisons, mostly.





*Dieter gets in on the rest act.*
*As he divvies up the goods...*







While resting, the group starts to relax.  However, this is a bad place to relax.  There is a chittering coming from the hallway.  Maouelue rushes to the doorway.  Nothing is there.
*The mage puts a metal hand on each of his companions and speaks a word of comfort.*

"Thank you friend.  I believe we just might be needing that.  Soon."  Frume looks around, nervously.


*He leads them down the S hallway.*
Maouelue, Dieter, and Frume exit the S doorway.  Frume's torch sputters and cracks, throwing light erratically around the finished stone walls.  A few feet past the entrance, the party hears a *thump* coming from behind Frume...

Frume's eyes go milky white as the disgusting creature rears up and chitters at Dieter and Maouelue!
NE1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (**1**) + 3 = `4`.



*Maouelue raises his shield to disrupt the incoming curse.*

The cloudy eyes seem to clear momentarily, then they frost over fully.





The creature - scared of fire in this it's deep, dark home - shrieks and skitters, trying to get away from the flaming blade.

Frume, eyes all white, turns to Dieter and slashes with his rapier!


Blue light swirls around the Dragon Mage's gauntleted hands.  Stardust particles drift towards the creature and Frume, trying to lull them into slumber.  The two are unaffected.
*The mage blinks nonplussed.*
The monster crawls up the wall and tries to get around to the other side of the party.  (AOO from Dieter and Maouelue.)


The thing crawls across and almost loses it's balance when it gets hit by the Blade of the Mists.  Is throws itself down behind Maouelue and attacks!


The bite finds a soft spot in the armor, piercing it and injuring the mage.  The claws rake against metal, however.

*The druid's eyes reflect the hatred in his eyes mingled with the flame of his blade as he slices through the form!*
Like a knife slicing through soft butter, Dieter slice through a mandible.
Frume's eyes are still white as he moves to attack again.






The thing hisses and chitters again, eyeing Dieter.  It moves forward...


As the claws rake across the Druid, a silvery force field comes up and blocks it, swiping it aside to hit Frume.

The claws rake across Frum, and the white eyes blink.  They are normal again.



✅ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Ape (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 13 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).

With a flourish of a rapier, he takes out the things legs, then appendages, finally driving the spike into the thing's head.  Twisting and pulling, viscera and brains are removed and sully the blade.  He turns to see if the others are okay.
[300 xp]


*They each quaff a superior potion and hand frumious a standard from their bags.*
*Maouelue searches the remains.*
