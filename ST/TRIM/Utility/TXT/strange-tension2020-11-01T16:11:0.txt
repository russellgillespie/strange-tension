strange-tension*Dieter, having had a moment now to absorb this change in his companion, begins to feel bolstered by this confident crusade. Since his last musings on the mirror, he felt empowered having a point of focus foe the battle in front of him...one for whom he wouldn’t have to bear the soulful burden of summoning. In a tight spot, Dieter knew deep down he would be happy to see the countrymen again, but for now he would use the shadow cast by his radiant friend to obfuscate his approaches and gain his advantage. It’s time now to serve the serpents a certain serenity.*



The two friends and their newfound companion gather their belongings and head towards where Frume said the lair entrance was.  The party moves through the cave into a spacious tunnel, and along the passage until it opens further into a cul-de-sac of sorts. Moving slower and slower as you approach, you can see figures guarding something at the very end of the cavern.

The party moves further in the cavern and is able to glean a few things.  Firstly, there are no exits save from whence they came.  There are four serpent beings milling about the front of a door, framed and made of stone.  Maouelue can see that there are bodies on the ground, a couple of the snake-beings are tending to them.  They're just off to the side of the door.  Lastly, the wizard sees that the door is odd in the sense that it doesn't have a handle or any other obvious way to open it.
*Maouelue whispers a few words to Dieter, the Druid’s eyes widen, the narrow and harden in assent.*
*Dieter pulls out his waterskin and draws forth a single drop. He begins speaking, his words sounding like waves crashing upon the shore, his hands pushing and pulling the drop as bread being kneaded and stretched. Maouelue mutters his incantation and splays his hands wide, wrist to wrist. With a nod, the two cast their magicks in turn.*

Frume's eyes go wide at the magical display he just witnessed.  He tries to hide behind a big rock, seeing the lizards on the ground, head reeling, slings a shot quickly.

The wizard can tell the beings on the ground are doing *very* badly.  Frume already killed one with a bolt.  There is one standing that looks fairly healthy, considering.
*As Maouelue strides forward, he pulls out a small piece of parchment on which he has scribbled a dragon. Speaking to it, it begins to spread around him in a golden aura.*



*He then raises his hands and shoots a piercing ray at the second snake being, slowly marching forward.*

Effect Shield removed from Maouelue.
The one remaining lizard person on the ground looks around at their frozen and pierced comrades, struggles to get up on their feet, and loads their range weapon...
He sees all three of you, decides to take a shot at... [1 Mao, 2 Dieter, 3 Frume]

And it tries to run backwards to hide near the door...
Slips a bit, doesn't get far.
There is one lizard person on the party's left side that is looking fairly hale.  It screeches, rattles something in it's throat (I'm hearing something like the raptors from JP) and takes a shot with their range weapon as well.

It hisses and moves to hide amongst the scree in the far side of the cavern.

*Dieter touches his ring and goes invisible, moving around to the left of the tunnel.*

Seeing the thing's arrow hit Dieter hard, Frume starts to go check on the man.  However, he goes invisible just as Frume steps forward.  Shaking his head at the magical wonders that never cease, he peers through the darkness to try and spot the lizard-person that snuck away...

And sees it...

Frume smiles when he hears the bolt hit home, then backs toward the guys to see if he can help them.


*Maouelue continues his steadfast march toward the serpents, his pace slowed, but his conviction not so weighed. He lets out another frosty advance.*

The snake-person takes the ray of frost to the it's back, knocking him down to a knee.  It is nearly frozen, the cold all around it affecting his cold, cold blood...  It tries to reach around with it's bow, possibly for the last time.

The arrow bounces off the cavern wall, the serpent hisses in pain and frustration.
The other serpent, seeing it's last remaining member fall, makes a dash to the door.  It hisses in it's own language, saying something serpent-esque, and the door cracks open slightly.  He makes to open it.
