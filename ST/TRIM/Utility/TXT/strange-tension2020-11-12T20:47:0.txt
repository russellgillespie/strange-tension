strange-tensionFrume uses his stump to point at an intricately carved double doorway, oak with iron bandings for the hinges.  Although not quite as elaborate as the garden scene from the metal door, this is just as well made.  The scene on it depicts a ritual taking place, a naked woman is on an altar, all variety of beasts cavort in the background.  Raising a blade in the air, the priest performing the ritual looks odd.  As you all come closer, you can see his face has been seared off, the wood scorched.
*Dieter give the door a cursory yank.*
It opens slightly, you hear falling metal coming from the other side.  The door is able to be opened, just catching on something now.  Beyond the small opening, the room is dark.
*Maouelue moves over to take a look, checking for traps and seeing whether he can perceive anything in the room with his darkvision.*

Maouelue can see torchlight flickering off some metal inside, looks like gold from here.  It's near the floor just inside, but the crack in the door isn't too big yet.  As Maouelue pulls back, he checks the picture on the door again.  (With that perception check...) Mao notices it's odd.  Something is odd about the scene.  (Investigation check, please!)

A sudden rush comes to the wizard as he's looking at the scene play out on the wooden door facades.  Immediately, there is a great sense of danger about what the ritual represents.  He's also very sure that this isn't depicting a ritual in the traditional sense.   It's more like the priest is defending himself from the woman.  As he looks closer, Maouelue notices horns on the woman's head...
*They all work together to clear and open the door.*
The doors swing wide, bringing with them a bevy of golden items.  Kettles, pots, dishware and silverware all clatter to the floor.  It is as if all of these items were piled up and shut inside hastily.  In the torchlight, a golden dais can be seen emerging from the mound.  Many more golden items are piled high on it, the dimensions are large and it basically seems like a pile of golden treasure in this room.  The dais is approximately 5ft by 10ft, placed directly in the middle of the room.
*The druid riffles through the pile, seeking anything gold resembling an acorn. But no matter if not...he could always melt it...*
*Maouelue takes more of a loremaster's approach and begins inspecting the items for additional symbols and examining the dais.*
There are many pieces here to melt down if you wanted, a few pieces of tableware that could be sufficient are around, too.  (d12 for how many you find.)
Maouelue sees the same thematic structure of the door on the walls of the room.  Mainly animals cavorting, then growing larger.  As the scene progresses from the front of the room to the back of the room, the animals seem to grow in sentience, walk on their hind legs.  They start slaughtering the lesser animals, until finally, on the back wall, a gilded form of a demon, two heads of simian make, with tentacles for arms, screams at the sky.  Beside him, a massive serpent is coiled around a tree that stretches from floor to ceiling, the top boughs even melding into the top stonework of the room.  To the right of the serpent, a skeleton with its musculature still attached, has the head of a dragon, the body of a humanoid, the legs of a lion, and the feet of a giant eagle.
As Maouelue makes his way into the room, he bumps and shifts through the various pieces when, in an instant, the pile shifts...
A rolling pile of golden debris falls around the room.  Revealing a woman manacled to the dais.
Frume stares at the woman.
"She's not breathin', lads.  But she doesn't look rotten, like everything else in the gods-forsaken caverns."
He starts to approach the dais.

Blue-silver light glows around the woman and the mage.  (Perception checks, please!)

The glow dissipates around the two, and the wizard leans down to the dais.  The woman is not breathing, not moving.  She looks perfectly healthy, otherwise.
*The mage pulls out a potion of healing and begins tipping it down the lady’s throat.*
Maouelue's gauntleted hands touch the woman.  He tips her head back and pours the red healing liquid in her mouth.  The liquid spills out, runs onto the dais.  She feels completely limp, as if she doesn't have any muscles at all in her slim frame.
*Maouleue raises his blade with both hands, the tip of the blade pointed downwards. He thrusts hard into the woman’s chest!*
Violent ripping and tearing of sinew and bone can be heard as the Dragon Mage's blade pierces the woman.  No blood spills, none is expelled from the wound.  The woman is still completely limp, like a doll of flesh.
The pale skin is reflected eerily in the pale blade.
*Dieter shoves him aside and sniffs at the lady, his snout turning a bit long and whiskered...*

Frume steps further into the room, saying "Whoa, Dieter, what's going on?"
“Baeeestttsss! Grreaaaauuuuuueeeoooogggh!!”
*He leads them back over to the door with the star key.*
With a wistful look back, Frume follows.
*The group is clearly beginning to suffer from their long stint underground. Maouelue is losing the thread of his righteous vigor. Dieter is aping out unwittingly. The metal mage rushes over to the door and instead the star key, twisting hard.*
