strange-tensionThe Staff of Baobab is special.  It can only be used by a druid.  When inserted into soil, a great baobab tree grows (you can decide the height & look).  The tree bears only two pieces of fruit per growth.  This fruit, when consumed, heals 1 disease and does 8d4+8 healing.
*A pure feeling of life seems to seep into Dieter's being as he takes the staff from Maouelue.*
The shield is called the Shield of Disruption.  Adds +1 to your AC and it has 4 charges to impose a CON save (DC10+Intelligence modifier) on a creature using any spell.  You can spend 1 charge against the spell, or spend more for higher level spells.  (If you wanted to counter a spell at 5th level or above, the DC would go down by 3 for every level higher.)
The mace twinkles in the candlelight.  This is the Mace of Reduction.  The attack and damage rolls have +1, crits on 19 and 20, and on a natural 20 the target is under the effect of the *Reduce* spell.

*The group ruffles through the burgeoning bags of holding to produce the Barbarianâ€™s Wind tome. Dieter holds it in his hand and speaks the rune using his most ostentatious form of Giant.  (He loves to be very presentational in front of the henchmen...)*
As the druid holds the book aloft and speaks the Giant rune, the book glows a glittery blue hue.  The words on the page magically rearrange themselves into different words, pictures, diagrams.  As they come together and form a completely new tome, a sharp pain courses through Dieter's head.
*Fighting back the pain, Dieter attempts to pore over the tome and withdraw its secrets.*
As the words coalesce, Dieter has a harder and harder time concentrating on the book.  At the height of his ability, he's still not able to comprehend the language or read the book at all.  His headache starts to get worse...
*Stenchy picks it up and hands it over to Dieter, who hastily puts it on, not fully knowing what it will do.*
*It's a bit awkward to hold the book while putting the helm on, but Stenchy lends a hand to help him sort it out.*
As the helm goes on, a feeling of sharp cold comes over Dieter.  It helps quell the pain of his head, but only momentarily.  (Is he still trying to read it?)
The cold abates and Dieter starts feeling comfortably warm, noticing for perhaps the first time how cold his surroundings really were before.
*Dieter sets the book down momentarily and produces a flame, he sends a bit of it into each of the emptied rune chests to provide some additional light and heat in the room. He gestures to Maouelue to take a look at the book.*
*Maouleue picks up the tome and tries to read some of it as well. He wonders whether he'll have the same searing experience.*
Maouelue is able to read it perfectly.  It is the musings of an arcanist who was obsessed an ancient race of people called the Netherese.  The land of Netheril was located where the Anauroch desert is today, and a mageocracy of peoples inhabited the land.  Thousands of years ago, the archmages of Netheril controlled magics unheard of, and with their prideful demise, most of the artifacts and knowledge died with them.  That did not stop this particular arcanist from searching, and clearly finding, books and items from the bygone era.  This spellbook is both an account of what the arcanist was able to glean from the books in this library, as well as his dabbling into some of the forgotten magics therein.  The books and items in this room are priceless, worth more than a mansion in Waterdeep for some buyers.  Collectively, you could be looking at millions of platinum to the right person.
*The group packs up their things and Dieter coalesces the fire and moves it over toward the plate armor.*
*Stenchy looks admiringly at the armor and sizes himself up against it.*
*As Dieter is responding, Stenchy is already coveting the armor and running his sweaty hands over the epaulets.*

As Stenchy touches the matte black armor, it's hand shoots out and grasps the henchman's!
The grip is a vice lock, Stenchy tries to pull back and fails.
As Stenchy is trying to wriggle free, the armor, now animated with red flames for eyes, steps off of it's podium...

AN1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (12) + 0 = `12`.
*Dieter, seeing his companion grappling with the animated suit, hurls his boomerang in hopes of disengaging it.*


*He picks up his Bladestaff with his now-free hand and charges it with magical energy, preparing for close combat.*

The armor tightens it's grip on Stenchy further and swings him into the nearby bookshelves.

It then whips him back around, slamming him against the chests.

*Frenchy takes a pot shot with his crossbow and pings the armor at the gorget.*

*Maouelue tries to freeze the armor, but is rebuffed by the metallic form!*
*He preps a frosty ball anyway...*
