strange-tensionEveryone is making great time, and pushing hard to get the pass.  The mountain looms in front of them.  The nightwalkers let out a baleful, clicking howl, sending shivers down everyone's spine.

Just as the group gets to the foot of the mountain, the group enters the shade proper.
Benna is suffering from exhaustion.  (Her survival check is at disadvantage.)
Daran rummages through his pack, gets out the meager climbing gear, and says, "Let's bundle up.  It's going to get colder as we get higher."

Tramping up the new pass, the group finds a great, easy slope up and make it a decent distance.  There are a few concerns...  there are a few ledges here that look pretty dangerous.  Plus, there happen to be a few caves and crevices through this pass, which could hide a number of things...

The climb starts getting rockier, steeper.  Daran leads as best he can, making sure the creatures are at a distance and that they're putting the right feet forward.  However, it is taking longer than expected.  Everyone, now, is suffering a point of exhaustion.  Couple that with the fact that the group has not slept in quite a while, this might be difficult going.  (Perception checks, please!)

Benna sits shivering in the snow-packed trail.  The rest spy a cave a little further on.  Daran, sizing up the group's situation, says to Maouelue, "Might be best to take a breather.  There's a cave up ahead there.  You and I can check it out, maybe make camp there for a longer rest?"
Lumao looks over at the sisters, who are looking rough and bitterly cold. 

“To the cave!”
“But for the sake of the gods, keep a lookout for anything that moves!”
"Let me take the lead on this one!"

Daran covers Maouelue's flank, the women huddle against the mount wall, trying to escape the bitter wind.  Maouelue does not see anything at this point, the cave looks to be deep, more than 20ft deep at least.  There are no animals visible. 

As the pair continue to make their way to the mouth of the cave, nothing else presents itself, but the inside is more visible now.   Darkness shadows the back of the hole in the mountain.  The ceilings are covered in sharp icicles, which start ten feet overhead.  The snow goes in a few feet, but the eddies of wind keep the rest of the cave snow free.  (Perception check, please!)

With a good look, and with Maouelue's dark vision, he can see pretty far into the cave.  It goes on a distance, the space opening up well past the limit of his vision.  Bones litter the floor.  Small bones, none look to be bigger than a human hand bone.  At least of what he can see.  (What would you like to do?)
Lumao asks the group to stand back by the entrance for a moment. He raises his hands toward the icicles hanging from the ceiling. He speaks a word of warmth...

"Let the fires of our hearts heat the hearth in this humble home."

As he says this, a blast of flames flows outward toward the ceiling, melting the ice into falling drops of water. Then, as the water falls and pools, he speaks a word of shaping and cooling, sending two large planes of water to either side of the group. He holds the makeshift walls of water in place, then concentrates on freezing them in place, leaving just enough of a gap at the top of each for airflow.

With this complete, he magically sops up the remainder of the water from the ground and patches up the edges, securing them in place. He then invites the group to circle round and huddle in.



Lumao sits, stroking his trusty hawk, as he slips into his reverie, oddly distant. Daran sees that the sisters are situated for a rest before taking up the watch.

A couple hours into the watch, Daran hears a scratching on the other side of the ice-wall.  The side that faces further into the mountain.  He can see movement on the other side as well.  Something big and hulking is moving back and forth along the ice wall...

He decides not to wake anyone just yet and try to surmise what the beast is.
A second white blur comes along and scratches the ice as well.
And then, a third...
Daran hides, trying not to move a muscle for fear the beasts might see him though the wall.
There's only about an hour left in Maouelue's reverie.  If they can just hold out...
The scratches turn to pounding.

There are low roars and some commotion.  Maouelue hears these murmurings and random poundings as he finishes his reverie.
He sees Daran, motionless, kneeling with hands on scimitars, ready to jump into action.
