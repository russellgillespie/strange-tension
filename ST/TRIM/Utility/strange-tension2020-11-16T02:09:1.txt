strange-tension*Maouleue follows at a distance watching the scene unfold.*

She follows you, tiptoeing across the tiles again.  The three of you approach the lava room.  Dieter immediately senses something is off.  Frume is not at his post.
*Dieter takes note, but does not falter. He leads her around to the left of the lava and to the door.*
“Go in here.”
"Master wants me to go... into the pit?"  She smiles.

“Yes. Take this. Dig me a staircase from the pit up to the right.”
*He hands her a shovel.*
*Meanwhile Maouelue does take note of Frume’s absence and begins lightly scanning for clues.*
The woman takes the shovel, in both hands.  She walks past the Dieter to the edge of the pit.  Approaching it backwards, staring at Dieter, she stops at the very edge facing away from it.  She cocks her head again, looking deeply into Dieter's eyes.  "We could have had so much fun."  She falls backwards into the pit.

Maouelue checks the lava room, no signs of struggle.  He checks the garden vault.  Some bars of platinum are missing.
*He chuckles to himself.*
“Poor soul. He deserves whatever he made off with. This mission took more than he could afford.”
*He whispers a few words of prayer.*
“Someday...maybe you will let us make good on our promise...”
*He turns back to rejoin Dieter.*
As Dieter looks into the pit he sees...
His shovel laying on the ground, amidst bones and other detritus.
“Hmph...it figures.”
*He goes back over to the lava room and stares down in the pit for a few moments. Then pulls out his bedroll and finds a spot with a suitable temperature inside the room, then lays down shuddering.*
*Maouelue sees this strange passage of behavior and stands vigil over his resting friend.*
As he walks away, Dieter hears coquettish laughing in his head.
*As Dieter descends into dreams he sees a great wheel emerging from the space in between a great darkness and a great light. Like two planes meeting, rising vertically into the sky. Dieter’s mind’s eye begins to deviate. The black and white begin to overlap as the flat scene becomes skewed by an additional dimension. A thin strip of grey seems to swirl in limbo. This part of the scene begins to bulge with perspective, becoming increasingly radial as it extends toward the primal spirit eyes of the Druid. As this pushes and rolls onward, a dichotomy of shadow and highlight begin to spread out from the wheel onto the black and white planes. Each is affixed with a symbol in its opposite shade. The white plane bears a semicircular black dragon, mouth open in pursuit. The black plane is an inverted mirror of the white, with the darkness penetrated now by a radiant white dragon.

The grey in the middle begins to turn a wild and perhaps slightly pestilential green which casts a verdant pallor over the whole scene. As it does, the great wheel that has extended begins to turn in earnest, starting the great rotation of the planes. The scene pivots slowly on its vertical axis around a point in the center of the wheel. The planes seem to shrink inwards and the draconic images are pulled and distorted as they suck back in to the center. At last the pivot ceases, revealing a dusky grey background with a great wheel turning in the center, each of the dragons now in its place, both predator and prey, light, forever eating dark, forever eating light, forever shaded by green, both bountiful and baneful. 

A snake slithers around the hub, weaving in and out of the spokes, flicking a red tongue as it does, piercing the colors of the vignette. It’s eyes turn, they look back directly into the mind’s eyes.*

“Sssuuurrreeennndddeeerrr....”

(So it's less Quantum Leap and more Eastern religion/previous life, where he knows all that's happened on the 'other side'.  He's not burdened with jumping back and forth, but he does have memories of being the other entity."


The two, keeping especially close watch, as safe for the time being.  As the walls seem to close in around them, they wake up feeling rested, at least.

*As Maouelue comes out of his customary trance, he looks across at Dieter, who is huddling near the warmth of the pit. The druid seems worried about something...It has been a harrowing week, and the mage considers that there is indeed a lot to be worried about, then his mind moves on to other matters.*
*Dieter, surprised at this bit of impetuousness, breaks his brooding and slowly a determined look comes over his face. He moves over to the pit and looks down to where the armored man has jumped.*

Maouelue jumps into the pit, putting his faith to the test.  Yet even the power of Bahamut, in all of his glory, can't stop the spikes from battering him around as he hits the ground hard.  There is something he can feel...  he probably should have had more damage, but instead he's only lightly bruised.  (Take 4 points of bludgeoning damage.)

When he comes to himself and looks around, he sees four solid walls, a bunch of bones and debris, and Dieter's shovel lying on the floor of the spike pit.
