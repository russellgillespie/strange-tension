strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>He stands back up slowly and pats his amigo on the hindquarters. He leads back down out to the corridor and turns left to inspect the end of the hallway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Moving around the corner, Maouelue almost has a heart attack when he sees an enormous frost giant in the middle of the room!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then he notices the pedestal and that the being is lifted off of the floor by a foot or so, making him more imposing than usual.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The being is either dead and stuffed, or under some type of spell.  He's almost completely frosted over, but that might just be how frost giants look.  He is in full regalia, too - full giant armor and holding a gigantic shield and spear.  There is also a closed door on the E side of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He backs away slowly, not quite ready to there...yet. He heads back around through the armor room and hangs a Lumao at the junction, inspecting the space to the East.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... and sees a massive wall of ice.  Inside the block are beings, seemingly frozen in stasis.  The far side of the block can be seen, but just vaguely.  The block looks to be several feet thick.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks to see if there is a way around to see it from all sides.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The only areas are the halls he's seen.  Nothing backs around to the other side.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He puts his hand to the ice and wipes away the rime, trying to see more clearly what, or whom lies within.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue looks into the depths of the ice block, peering into the miasma that becomes clearer and clearer the deeper he goes.  Bones, bits of armor, various weapons, body parts...  all suspended in the ice...  or...  it looks strange, now.  The mage moves back and forth along the length of the blockage, sussing out the contents.  There are definitive striations, vertical markings where it looks like the ice might have frozen against something.... an invisible wall of sorts.  This striation is on both sides, six feet or so from the edge of the side walls.  There doesn't seem to be horizontal striations, but the vertical definitely stand out as he moves across the surface of the ice wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue shudder, privately praying that he doesn't end up a disembodied array of items frozen in that mass of ice. He moves back around to the Giant Room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is sparse, the only furnishing is the frozen giant.  The door on the E side of the room is made of pure solid metal, something very fine (investigation check for material).  The base of the giant is frosted over, but it looks to Maouelue like there's a small plaque near the base.  There are words on the plaque, giant markings, but only the first few words and letters can be seen.  The rest are obscured by ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He investigates the door material then tries to wipe away the ice obscuring the letters.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That’s pretty metal.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Can't quite tell what the door is made of.  It's definitely not made of ice, though.</p><p>The ice on the statue base will have to be removed for Maouelue to read/make sense of it.  (Mao speaks Giant, right?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"... m a giant, an anci..."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes out his knife and begins to scratch away at the icy covering, trying to reveal the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue looks up at the king’s necklace, seeing just what these <i>jewels</i> might be.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is no necklace on the giant.  He wears no crown, either.  Just bulky armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes out the mace, thinking to crack through the remaining ice, but takes a moment to inspect the Giant’s shield and insignia.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The shield is of exceptional make and quality.  As is the armor and the great-axe at the giant's side.  The rimed shield does have a raised insignia, a series of runes that identify him as a bard of the frost giant ordning, who have a major place in frost giant society.  Unlike traditional bards, frost giant bards are specifically runesmiths.  Some of the runes lining the perimeter of the shield give Maouelue a twinge, but he can't put a finger on how he recognizes them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue pulls out his book of drawings and etchings comparing the runes to the Runemark and others he took down in the Muhlen Vault.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A <i>lot</i> of them match up.  Most of them, in fact.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dieter should be here...” <i>sigh</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Friend.</i> The Dragon mage utters in the Giant tongue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It stands solid and frozen in place.  No reaction.</p></div>
