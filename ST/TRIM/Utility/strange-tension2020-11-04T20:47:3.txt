<div class="character-1"><p>With a flash and a humongous <i>BANG</i> the trapdoor <i>EXPLODES</i> upward, causing a rain of metal, rock, and dust to fall in on the heroes.  No damage is done, but I'm afraid...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Once the dust settles, two female faces stare down at the party from the hole where the trap door had been.  Brightened by the torch flames and backlit by the strange lighting of the chamber they're in, Veena and Hozieh Muhlen stare down at the group in disbelief.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>It is not currently anyone's turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lights in the area change and shimmer.  They all turn to a black-light version of themselves.  Almost as if each light is a miniature black hole, they seem to drawn in light rather than emit it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>No matching spells found in the combatant's spellbook. Cast again with the <code>-i</code> argument to ignore restrictions!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The room is roughly ten by twenty (height by length), stocked full of herbs and ingredients.  Strange smells waft in the air, the sounds of burbling liquids are bouncing around the stone walls.  You can't really make out details as the light is very strange in here, but you can see your quarry standing at the E end of the room, approx 15 feet away from you.  There seems to be an exit on her left (S) and a door behind her on the right (E).</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>DD moves to block the S door</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue makes to help Frumious jump up into the chamber as well, offering his overlapped hands.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He readies himself for the moment when Frumious is up</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank ye, friend!"  (To jump is 3+strength modifier, with a 10 foot running start.  Standing high jump is half that number.  At this point, Frume is up for sure.  How high can Maouelue jump?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume puts his arm down once he gets in the room, hoping Ding Dong can hold off the woman for a minute.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Veena smiles at the armored wizard who just popped into her space.  She waves her arms in front of him, saying dark words.  A living nightmare grips Maouelue, his darkest fears revealed to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What a bitch!"  He pulls his crossbow, aims...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite..."</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>All effects removed from Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all watch as the woman starts growing a massive tail, trailing out from behind her.  It whips and <i>cracks</i> against the walls of the room.  She says, "Fine.  If I can't play with your mind, I'll play with that pretty armor."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and hisses, not noticing the damage wasn't as much as she'd hoped.</p></div>
