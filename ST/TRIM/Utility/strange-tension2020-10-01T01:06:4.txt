<div class="character-1"><p>The walls are silver ore veins. (Investigation check for more.)</p><p>The chest looks locked.</p><p>The creatures are standard animals, the goblin doesn't have any identifying marks on it.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any usable weapons</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You're going to need some supplies to get the ore out, Maouelue and Dieter see one lone spade and a pickaxe in the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter also finds 5 silver on the goblin</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the chest for any sign of a trap.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter slaps Maouelueâ€™s hand out of the way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There seems to be a catch inside the lock.  Dieter finds something to jam into the keyhole, and something clicks and a low hiss starts coming from the chest.  </p><p>(Dexterity check to avoid, or another sleight of hand to try to diffuse.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The lock abruptly explodes, sending shrapnel out in all directions.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Each of you take 6 points of damage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the chest pops open, Maouelue and Dieter get struck by flying metal shards.  One pierces the wizards chest, and he falls to the ground.  A shard glances by Dieter's face.  As his face whips around to see his friend fall, he spies several potion bottles lining the bottom of the chest.  Some glisten red.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter searches frantically through the potions for something to save his friend, knowing that he was out of spell slots to cast his healing word.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are potions of healing in the chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a slightly quivering hand, Dieter uncorks and drizzles the contents of one of the bottles gently down Maouelueâ€™s throat.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a shuttering breath, Maouelue's eyes pop open.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both lean over and peer into the chest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are at least four more potions of healing, two standard, two greater.  (I got the number wrong, too, it was supposed to be 2d4+2.  Give the wizard another hit!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are two potions of digging.  One bag of holding.  And a scroll of disguise self.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and the wizard, although going quickly, investigate the area thoroughly.  The two cannot tell if the human is Douglas or not, but they take the corpses features down to relay them to the people in the town, just in case.  The ore veins will take a few hours to mine, the best that you could hope for at the point is to take a few hours and get 6 pounds of ore for the both of you.  (Approx 6 gold).  There is a curious section that looks like it has already been mined, but dirt and debris was piled back up quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With that check, it would take an hour to remove some of the debris from the cavity.  Two hours to completely remove everything.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and wizard quiet their bodies and minds and reach out in the darkness for signs of life.  You're facing North.  The tunnels you've travelled are to the West and Northwest.  There is a tunnel directly ahead of you, one to the Northeast, and one due East.  There are muffled sounds coming from every tunnel.
