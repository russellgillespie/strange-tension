<div class="character-1"><p>@Russell </p><p>lately trying to keep an ear out for any sign</p><p>of adventure and you hear a lot about what</p><p>is going on in the town. It’s no surprise that</p><p>you have begun to recognise lots of the</p><p>patrons and stall owners. Many are just</p><p>weekly customers and some regular</p><p>travellers from a nearby village but you also</p><p>have your chaperoned nobles from the</p><p>merchant sector and adventurers looking</p><p>for supplies. Much like you they standout,</p><p>something about their bearing making</p><p>them noteworthy. You’ve also come to</p><p>know some of traders by first name and</p><p>when one day you’re standing looking at</p><p>the spices on the colourful exotics stall you</p><p>spot the merchant Culver quietly talking to</p><p>a miner, concerned looks on their faces.</p><p>You sidle up to within ear shot and pretend</p><p>to examine the ceramic kettles on the</p><p>barter stall.</p><p>“Have you seen Douglas recently?”</p><p>“I saw him at the Pig and Falcon a fortnight</p><p>passed but not recently, why do you ask?”</p><p>“He was meant to be working up at the</p><p>Mine at Krytos Hills, you know beyond the</p><p>red plain, but I haven’t seen him of late.</p><p>Usually he’s at the Pig as you say.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t think there’s anything to worry</p><p>about. He’s probably just camped out</p><p>somewhere.”</p><p>“Nobody has seen him.”</p><p>“Not even down the Pig?”</p><p>“No, it’s been a while and I’ve known him</p><p>for an age. For Douglas to spend this much</p><p>time away from the tavern seems very</p><p>strange.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“The problem is Culver, that I’ve heard</p><p>there are goblins roaming those parts</p><p>recently. I just hope the old fool hasn’t got</p><p>himself into trouble.”<i>himself into trouble.”</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue unfolds the map and shows it to Dieter. They both look at each other and nod to head directly toward the mine on foot.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>You make your way safely to the place marked on the map.  Although you hear beastly noises coming from some forested areas, you are spared any horrific encounters.  After cresting a small rise, you see a small mine entrance carved into the stone.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter considers the scent of the smoke coming out of the cavern. Searching for any hint of a familiar odor.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p><i>Maouelue clearly sees through the darkness that a small campfire lined with stones still emits smoke and ash.  Beside the fire, two bedrolls lay empty.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue approaches the cave entrance from the right, Dieter from the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is no response.  You hear the calls echo throughout and rebound and come back to you very quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue lights a torch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You go to inspect the chest and see that the lock has already been broken off, in a brutal fashion. </p><p>(Do you want to check for traps?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue opens the chest.  It creaks and a very noxious odor comes out.  Take 1 point of damage from the nausea that comes over you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard looks in, he sees random body parts, rotting and creating an ooze a the bottom of the chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter notices two things.  The bedrolls have a layer of dust on them, indicating they've been there for a while, maybe a tenday.  Second, the sound echoes strangely deeper in, giving it a weird, unbalanced vibe.  It could be the way the stone was mined or the way the tunnels go, but the acoustics are giving everything a strange, undulating texture to speech and sounds.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue taps into his Eleven history, recalling a bit about silver having a strange property when it comes to sound.  Silver mines are known to play with miner's inner ear, make them unbalanced and groggy.  It's not unheard of for miners in silver mines to wear items over their ears to protect them from the sound.   However, it does leave them open to attack, if they don't have the proper security on hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The company moves into the hallway left of the cave entrance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p></p><p>beyond. It is approximately 7-foot-wide and</p><p>the walls are covered with tool marks. Ten</p><p>foot in, you find two more bedrolls and ten</p><p>foot beyond that, is a flight of stone stairs</p><p>down into the dark. Beyond the tunnel</p><p>tapers, narrowing to 3 foot wide.<i>tapers, narrowing to 3 foot wide.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>You have no characters.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>About a half hour into Maouelue's meditation, a group of bats flies by outside in the darkening dusk.  One of them breaks from the pack to glide into the edge of the cavern mouth.  It lands, upside down, right above the wizard.  It's eyes are open, however, and it's eyeing Dieter hungrily.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter side-eyes the bat</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat hisses at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sends his bat down the first hallway to inspect past the taper.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat flies down the hallway.  A couple of minutes later, it comes back.</p><p>(Animal handing check, with advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat lands above the wizard and, telepathically, relays what he saw.  There were two bedrolls, moth eaten and dusty.  Silver ore veins ran rampant through the far end of the tunnel.  The taper stops several feet in, good silver available there.  There is something strange, though, at the beginning of the narrowing.  Something...  empty.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You receive - "Walls too thick."</p><p>(Is Dieter at the mouth of the tunnel by chance?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>When the bat returns, Dieter casually, but obviously, wanders away from the bat and toward the taper.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter approaches the narrowing of the walls, the stairs off to the right become more and more evident.  The reason being is that Dieter now can hear snuffling and scratching coming from down that corridor.  The stairs go down at a very steep angle.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter continues down the staircase and calls back to Maouelue to follow. He uses his scimitar to brace himself down the steep stairs and Maouelue uses his quarterstaff to do the same.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(No worries.)</p><p>These stairs are not meant for either set of feet as first Dieter then Maouelue stumble, then slip down the stairwell.  You don't take any damage, nor do you fall prone.  But you do alert the green-skinned creature currently bent over a human body, muttering to itself.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No longer muttering, however, as it turns around quickly to see you.  It snarls and, as it does so, releases the leash he's holding.  Two slavering dogs quickly pounce as the creature reaches for its weapon...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p><i>The first dog, emaciated and snarling, lunges for Dieter and misses.  The goblin, reaching for his scimitar, gets confused and thinks about going for his shortbow instead and misses his turn.  The next dog runs head-on to Dieter.   He stands his ground the the dogs bite just misses his leg.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>The first dog tries to right itself, only to flail out with a hasty bit, missing the elusive Dieter.  The goblin, finally deciding to use the scimitar, stumbles, overcorrects, then falls on his scimitar, eviscerating itself.  The last dog takes a hefty bite, doing some damage to Deiter.</i></p></div>
