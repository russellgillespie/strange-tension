<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is whisked away to a vast, open field of grass.  In front of him is a giant wall, over eight feet tall.  Just in front of the wall are five beings, what looks to be a dwarf, a halfling, a gnome, a human, and a dragonborn.  The dragonborn can reach up and touch the top of the wall, while the gnome is well away from the top.  There are shouts coming from the other side of the wall, clamoring for aid.  The five are in a frenzy about how to scale the wall.  The halfling sees you, runs over, and says, <i>"Hey mister, we're sure glad to see you.  Our families are on the other side of that wall, we need to get to them quick - do you think you can help us?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dragonborn, you flank the wall, followed by the human; forgive me, I do not yet know your names, but we can deal with the pleasantries later. Master dwarf, you come next followed by the halfling and gnome respectively. Thus you shall form the fellowship of the staircase and scale yourselves up. Human, toss the dwarf if you have to, dragonborn, cradle your hands as a step and your shoulders to boot. The lot of you should be able to hoist the dragonborn thereafter, and if naught else I can provide a push. May these tactics lead you to those who call for aid, and may you provide it well and willingly.</p></div>
