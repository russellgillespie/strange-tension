strange-tension*Dieter hesitated a moment as he pulled something shiny out of his pack.

It couldn't be...

It was...the Mirror!

Oh dear...what—?*
*And with that, he leads Maouelue out toward the crevasse without a backward glance.*
*And with that he begins singing and weaving his arms, pointing his hands at the soil in and around their side of the crevasse upward, rising.*

*Then he sinks the Staff of Baobab right down in the soil at his feet, sticking out at an angle into the rising abyss of the crevasse's center. A giant Baobab tree begins to ascend up and outward, climbing into the upper reaches of the cavern, a thin route cut out of the enchanted thicket surrounding the tree's trunk.*
*The mage...for once...is speechless.*
Dieter taps into a deep pool of druidic knowledge.  Warm humming stems from him and echoes around the cavern, casting harmonics everywhere.  A crescendo of sound, positive radiant energy is visible as golden and green sparkle motes in the air.  The bats take flight moments before Dieter thrusts the Baobab staff into the ground.  

At first, nothing happens.  Then, the gold and green motes seem to be sucked into the staff, giving it a glow that nearly blinds the two heroes.  Dieter yells to his friend to stand back just as roots erupt from the bottom of the staff, growing directly into the soil of the cavern wall.  Thick shoots start emanating from the staffs top, and the width of the staff starts to grow.  Second by second the staff adds more boughs.  The staff turns into a massive tree growing from the side of the cavern wall.  Vines have knotted themselves up the side of the tree to make a makeshift walkway/ladder the men can use to climb up.  With a final *creak*, the tree finishes its growth, a tuft of leaves blotting out the sunlight at the top of the rift.

*Maouelue stares awestruck. He flaps his jaws soundlessly for a few moments then simply says,* “Well done friend! It is magnificent.”
*The two then tighten their pack straps and start to make their way up the long course of thick ivy and vines with which Dieter has surrounded the tree trunk.  It’s a tough slog, but the extra footing and holds help greatly as they ascend. A glance downward shows Quenchy sitting out by the wall of the crevasse smoking a rolled cigarette and making dismissive gestures.*
*Dieter and Maouelue slog their way up the tree. It is slow going through the thick branches, but they take their time to avoid any...pitfalls.*
*Maouleue is suited back up, so he has a particularly tricky time and you can hear his plate armor clanking and reverberating about the abyss, loud to the point of wincing as they ascend.*
Loaded and saved data for Quenchy!
yes






The Frenchmen make themselves at home, picking out areas for their work, and even dismantling the trap in the hallway so they're able to move through with ease.  The climbers hear the bats flit around them, but they do no damage as one of their members is friendly to Maouelue.  All told, the trek up the tree takes some time, but the two reach the top branches and the entrance to the barrow right around sundown.


You both crest the opening of the scarred earth and hear talking.  It's low but it sounds like two people arguing.
*Sounds of scrabbling up the wall farthest away from Dieter and Maouelue.*
*Dieter signals back to Maouelue to stop moving. He touches his ring and shimmers as he disappears from sight.*
*Dieter climbs as quitely as possible up through the crack, peeking his head out to survey the scene around him.*
*Maouelue tries to find a comfortable branch to support his temporary repose.*


As the woman comes over the blocks of broken stone, she sees the tops of the tree and hears a creaking as Maouelue settles himself on a branch.  
"What the hell...?"
*Dieter takes the chance while his prey is distracted to pull out his shortsword and grapple the woman from behind, holding the sword to her throat, whispering,* 

"Make a sound and you're headed down there..."

*He gestures to the pit below the tree.*
"Whom do you work for?"

Somehow she senses something coming up from behind her.  You get your sword out, bring it around to her front and try to grapple her from behind.  She wrenches a hand out and flails at the air, not seeing but sensing a body pressed against her.  Just before you're able to get the sword under her neck, she knocks your arm away.

"Get over here!"
She tries to roll away from the danger she senses, but Dieter catches her arm as she moves.

TH1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (**20**) + 0 = `20`.
"Mao get up here..."

The woman screams at the invisible force still grabbing her.  It is very loud, echoing around the chamber room.  Her main arm is being held, so she tries to wrench it away...

The woman tries to pull away, the druids grip is too tight.


Effect invisible removed from Dieter Deleter.

*Maouelue sees a stray cricket in the thicket and realizes it's his ticket to the wicket, so he picks it up and flicks it into the air, speaking and waving to it as he does so, sending a soft sweet song into the bandit's ear.*
