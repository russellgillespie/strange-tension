<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is very much still focused on the large beast in her midst.  Maouelue, seeing the eladrin fall, hears from down the tunnel they were running,  the sound of more running feet - coming towards them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue picks his head up, searching for the fallen eladrin, listening for the coming footsteps.  Suddenly, an arrow comes from the darkness beyond the fallen bodies, farther up the tunnel!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow arcs over Maouelue, over Bellatrix...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>...And lands in the middle of the creature's body, causing it to rise up and trash around wildly.</p><p>(Dex saves, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue clambers away safely.  Bellatrix dodges just in time to miss an errant claw swiping through the air.  As they both fall to the ground, more arrows come from the black space, followed by summer and spring eladrin, bows trained and firing on the beast hovering over the heroes.  In a few moments, the cavalry arrives in full, killing the animal and a familiar face greets the fallen Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>"Thought we'd lost you, Dragon Mage,"says a battered Jelentrianna, captain of the guard of the Summer Court.  "There's quite a few folk going to be happy to see you alive and well."  She offers a hand to Maouelue and Bellatrix.  </p><p></p><p>"Only the two of you left?  What of the older woman and the ranger?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well met Jelentrianna! A sight for sore...and cold eyes indeed! The lady Benna is recovering her strength around the corner, praise the Platinum. Our good friend Daran however... he is clouded from my sight. It seems he has faded, if not gone entirely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"A fair tale we have to regale you with though to be sure! What of the assault, what of the dark Queen?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well met and well found indeed!  The war goes well, it seems we've just breached the main hold.  I was hoping you could tell us more of the Queen of Air and Darkness - we have not been able to find her.  Our magics are clouded as to her whereabouts as well, so we had hoped to find her here.  If you're asking, I can only assume she's eluded you too.  No matter, we will scour this keep and then burn it to the ground!"  The contingent she's with yells heartily and fans out, scouting other corridors bending around.  A large group pass by into the heart of the stone rooms, searching and continuing the fight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Have you completed your tasks, Dragon Mage?  Or do you wish to go back to the Court?  Once there, we can debrief you more on the war efforts."</p></div>
