There are some aches that even the elven food won’t cure, and it certainly does not quell the smell of his under armor sweat. He strips down bare leaving the armor and garments in a corner of the room before moving into the washroom and drawing a hot bath for a long-overdue soak. </p><p></p><p>Though he is by rights a frost mage, Maouleue does not shy away from bringing the water to a heat just shy of scalding. A pure heat from within, as Shi’Vandos used to say, stays an frozen heart when the ice starts to flow. </p><p></p><p>As he sets himself in and lets the hot water scour his skin and spirit, the rare combination of warmth, silence, and safety cast him into a misty reverie.</p><p></p><p>The rising steam in his eyes turns to swirling clouds, spinning upwards to a vision of the tower where his master...his father...<i>it still hadn’t quite set in after all this time...</i> had led him to the discovery of his secret heritage. The memories, always a distorted mixture of emotions in his mind, seem to resolve more clearly in this palace of starlight....</p><p></p><p><i>“My son....”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"... Shi'veilan is his name.  He is your younger brother.  I am... sorry it's taken this long to tell you of him."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Master...." </p><p></p><p>Maouelue, bewildered at the flood of destabilizing revelations, is not yet ready to call him <i>Father</i>...</p><p></p><p>"...Why?...Why have you kept this from me for so long? Why would you send me away at the moment of knowing? We could have....We could have...."</p><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shi'Vandos smiles kindly down at the boy, but the smile doesn't completely reach his eyes.  He looks sorrowful and frustrated.  "It is...  not a story I like to tell.  I would rather you remember me, know me for my triumphs.  Not my failures.  Mortals have the potential for great works and deeds.  Yet, when posed with the possibility of... gratification..."  He shrugs.   "We are mortal.  My choices have erred on the side of pleasure, as time is so short.  Even for us elves."  He calmly moves to sit at a nearby chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue does not speak fir fear of faltering. He listens patiently, trying in vain to still the icy tempest forming in his heart and soul.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elder elf sees the torment on his pupil's face, and the look of sorrow deepens.  Not only for what has been done, but what needs to be done as well. </p><p></p><p>"I shall try to explain.  Some time ago, I was fortunate enough to live in and study the magics of the Feywild, a section of Arborea or Celestia, another plane altogether.  It is where a selection of elves, some would say the <i>prime</i> selection of elves, segregated themselves.  It is a land rife with danger, beset on all sides by evil that would tear the elves asunder if they let their guards down for an instant.  Not exactly Arvandor, but, then again, what can be.  I was born there, grew there, learned the secrets of magic there...  and was exiled from that wondrous land because of my...  nature.  A woman was my downfall."  He hangs his head, but there is a smile on his face, in remembrance.  "Noble families can be particular about who they allow into their... erm...  bloodline.  My family... <i>our</i> family is not noble born.  We are not eladrin.  But we are still elf, and that should garner some respect, from all corners of Toril."  He shakes his head.  "Anyway, I was exiled and sent through a crossroad to the material plane.  Alone.  To make my way in the great world.  And I did so.  Sometimes alone.  Sometimes, no so much so.  There was a woman.  A druid.  In the wilds of the Neverwinter Wood.  I was near death.  She took me in.  I owe her my life."  He stares into the distance, lost to his thoughts for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"When she told me she was with child...  I don't know.  I wasn't ready for that.  I was not ready for a life like that.  Nor was I able to give her or the child what they needed, and I knew that.  Yet there was no convincing her of that fact."  Shi'Vandros's long, sorrowful face looks into Lemaoue's soft, tear-filled eyes.  "Your mother and I parted ways that day, not destined to see each other ever again."</p></div>
