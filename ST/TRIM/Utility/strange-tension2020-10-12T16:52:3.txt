strange-tensionAfter a quick stop by the blacksmith's shop to procure Dieter's staff attachment (which is a beautiful counterpoint to the sliver death accompanying the opposite side of the staff now), the group heads Southeast, to a substantial group of farmland.  Rows of crops sway in the autumnal breeze as farm hands work with various animals.  An interesting addition, A group of rothe' roam the pasture past the waving grain.   These buffalo-type creatures typically come from the north, and it takes a practiced hand to raise them.
As the group plods deeper into the farm, you see a very dark-skinned man, wide brimmed hat in his hands, talking to a rothe', soothingly.  The man has curly white hair, balding a bit on the top.  Smile lines crease his face, and it's no surprise, he's grinning while talking to the large creature next to him.
He turns to notice the four people traveling towards him, smiles wider, and makes his way to you after patting the beast on it's rump.
"I was wondering when I would have a chance to run into you folks," he says, winning smile possibly going even wider.  "Heard a lot about what you've done for the town already, and what you're planning on doing. Might fine, migh-ty fine.  This little place's been waiting for men like you, been saying it for years, isn't that right Bellatrix?  It's right nice to see you as well, ma'am."  And he gives a little bow.




"Please, please, call me Vam.  No one calls me anything but, I won't let 'em!"  He laughs heartily.  "Now, what can I do for the Heroes of Oakhurst, eh?"
His smile falters, fades.  
"Wait, what did you say?"
He tries to see past you to the cage.
Seeing Veena, he's shocked.  He looks between the four of you, trying to understand what he's seeing.
"I don't understand.  She killed someone?  When did this happen?  How?"
*The party informs Vam of the events in the forest, withholding that they carry her possessions for now.*
*They also conveniently leave out the part about nearly setting the forest ablaze.*
He looks sternly at the group.  "Well, I have to admit...  Not too sure what to make of all this.  I have quite a bit of history, professionally, with this woman, as most of the town does.  This sounds just like one of them fairy tales, I just can't believe Veena could be capable...  Have you told anyone else?"
*Maouelue fidgets idly with his triumvirate of sliver orbs while the converse.*
*Dieter idly thumbs the contours of his newly-crafted eagle totem.*
"A-yuh, that sounds about right, we need to convene immediately."  He dons his hat.  "Lemme check on some things at the house, I'll put a word out to everyone to meet.  There is a building we use as the Council meeting area, but I'm afraid it's not available at the moment.  We'll just have to have them come here, does that work for y'all?"
*The group nods in assent. Everyone is nervous, but this seems an amicable accord thus far. Eyes remain open, but guard is lowered ever slightly.*
"Oh, one more thing," he says, tightening his gaze on the Maouelue, Dieter, and Bellatrix.  "This Douglas.  You, uh...  You still have the body?  Because if you do, I'd say we might want to bring him here, post-haste."
*Maouelue glances at Bellatrix.*
"We...had not time to intern it, but we have tried to secure it best we could. It's back at Trix's. Might should we head there together once the council is joined?"
"Tell you what," he turns and whistles at a nearby farm hand on a horse.  "One of you can go with Heston here and retrieve the body.  We might start without you, but no one is going to do anything without seeing Douglas's body."  With that, he makes a clicking sound with his cheek, nods to you all, and runs into the farmhouse at  good pace.
*Dieter obliges and makes great haste as he reassures Maouelue.*
As you enter the farmhouse, there are a couple older boys receiving orders from Vam.  
"Go round them up and bring them back here, double time.  Git going."
The boys dash out the door.
*Maouelue's fiddling becomes more intense as they wait. Creeping cryogenic crystals begin to form on the orbs' surfaces, stretching out from frosty fingertips.*
Vam doesn't see.
*Maouelue gazes around the farmhouse, taking in his surroundings.*

A handful of minutes pass.  A knock comes at the door and an older man with broad shoulders and a bald head peeks in.  His hands are large, gnarly, he's still wearing a smock of slick leather.  His face is lined, worn.  He looks extremely worried and says, "Vam, what's all this about needing to meet right away?"
*Maouelue sizes the man up with a glance.*
Maouelue sees a very nicely kept homestead.  Plain wood beams and walls cover the interior, sawdust is on the floor.  Everything looks worn but very naturally so.  There are saddles hung over a bannister that leads to a cellar, it seems.  There is a second floor as well.  The main floor of the house is one big room, encompassing kitchen, sitting room, dining area, and foyer all in one.  There is a small hallway off to the right of the wizard, which ends with a couple doors, one on either side of the hall.

He looks capable of handling himself in a fight, he's burly, strong.  He exudes an air of timidity, though.  Other than that, Maouelue doesn't get a real solid vibe about him.
He looks tentatively from Vam to you, very timid, very nearly backs out of the doorway.  Vam waves the big man in, and he stops his retreat.  He says, "Mm...  My name is Bazad.  I'm here for the Council meeting."
