strange-tensionThe hole is four by four, so it's about as big as a person.  Not too too much room to move around, but Dieter can light up the hole.  The ladder descends *far* into the earth.  The light shines about twenty feet down, just shows darkness beneath.  The druid throws the flame down.  It travels down, down, down...  Normally it would peter out 30 feet away, this one goes for a bit longer.   And it fades before hitting anything.
*Frenchy drops one down and Dieter catches it, whispering "Runemark" to it before dropping it as well.*
It lights up and falls...  falls... falls...  the light fades into the darkness.  No sound of the coin hitting anything.
*Dieter's form begins to shrink, then disappear into the darkness...*
*Dieter, realizing too late he's only a fledgling druid, changes his form of choice at the last moment and becomes....*


*Maouelue calls a spirit bat to his side and instructs it to follow Dieter down into the hole and be his eyes.*
The spider moves 20 feet per 6 seconds.  SpiDieter crawls vertically down the shaft, moving swiftly.  Three hundred feet down, a full minute and a half later, the spider feels the wall turn away ninety degrees to create the ceiling of a massive cavern.  Stalactites dot the roof of the cavern, making it difficult for the spider to see farther than five feet in front.  From this vantage point, the spiDieter cannot see the floor of the cavern.
*The bat sees Dieter continuing down the ladder, does a quick 100ft lap of the cavern ceiling, then begins heading back up to Maouelue to report.*
The bat, who has excellent echolocation, scopes out the cavern and maps it mentally for Maouelue...

The ladder lets out into the SE corner of the cavern.  The bat could *not* get a good estimate on how *deep* the particular areas of water are, however.
*Maouelue considers the news and is at least glad to hear that there is a indeed a bottom to the pit...*
*He sighs in resignation and produces a mage hand to assist the fellows in their descent. He sends Stenchy down first as he has the heaviest armor and focuses the hand on him.*







The group makes their way down the ladder.  It's not as rickety as you would think, the handholds are secure.  There is a bit of a scare when Frenchy slips on a rung.  Other than that, everyone gets down.  The water at the edge of the cavern, at the bottom of the ladder, is only a foot deep.  The henchmen are wading, waiting for the wizard.
*The Henchy brothers each light a torch as they look for drier footing.*
The water extends before the brothers' torches.  Maouelue can just see the edge of a small island in the middle of the cavern.
*Maouelue drops down the final rung and looks around. He looks around for Dieter but doesn't see him. He takes a few tentative steps toward the center island, pulling out his Quarterstaff to test the depth as he goes.*
Maouelue takes four steps, then the staff registers the floor falls away abruptly.
*He beckons to the Henchys to follow him and walks around the perimeter counter clockwise to a small just he sees on the East wall. He once again tests the waters as he steps out and gauges the distance to the center. It looks to him like about 20ft at that point. He begins to pull up a large cube of water from the area, hovering it in the air and spinning the 125 cubic feet of water in a mesmerizing ball that flickers reflections of the flames all over the cavern. He slowly begins to extend the water into a long bridge, similar to the one used above ground, this time considering the terrain, he makes it slightly narrower with higher sides to act as railings. He then leads the group across, giving Dieter time to do...whatever it is he needed to do so badly...*



Frenchy can see, just as the group is about to start across the ice bridge, something in the water.  He clocks it going S to N about ten feet from the bridge.
*The pair oblige*
*Maouelue leads the party backwards away from the bridge momentarily after they throw the torches.*
The sound burbles, moving past the bridge northward.  It goes past about thirty feet and the group can't hear it anymore.
*Maouelue sends his spirit bat to shadow the shadow.*


Frenchy makes it over without any problems. (Perception from Frenchy.)  

Maouelue's bat can't use it's echolocation through the water, but it does clock the sound going northward, then fading, assumedly diving further down.

The little island is made of shale and rough stone.  There is signs of someone or something being here recently.  Signs of a fire, scorch mark are on the ground in a couple places.  Bones litter the area.
*Frenchy inspects the bones trying to determine what animal they might be from.*

The bones are a mixture of human, rat, orc, boar, and lizard-like bones.  Strange scatterings everywhere, but concrntrated around the fire markings.
*Frenchy hurries back across the bridge to relay his findings, bracing himself against the icy railings to keep his balance.*

Frenchy very nearly slips on the ice, narrowly missing falling into the water.  He braces himself at the last minute.

The bat Maouelue tasked to watch the water catches signs of life again, this time closer to where the bridge meets the island.
*Maouelue telepathically directs it to buzz the surface of the water above the shadow.*

Something jumps out of the water, bites the bat, and brings it under the water.
