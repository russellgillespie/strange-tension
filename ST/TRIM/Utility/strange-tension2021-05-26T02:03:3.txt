<div class="character-1"><p>The dog pads over and begins nibbling at the proffered food.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ummmm....Bella?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue shakes his head and searches about the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves to the marbled dragon and sets his hands upon it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Whomever could you be, elegant dragon? What deeds have earned you this place of reverence?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Looking over the room, the statues are of various elves, all in a state of battle or reverence.  Most are fully armored, almost every one has a beautifully crafted weapon of some kind barred or in use.</p><p></p><p>The dragon statue is very similar.  Very lifelike.  This section has been enlarged from the others, to accommodate this statue and some of the others, which tower several feet over Maouelue's head.  The dragon is 20ft tall itself.  </p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage touches the marble statue, and a slight hum can be felt.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue let’s the hum overtake him, falling into a meditation on the hum’s internal rhythm and harmonies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The smell of smoke and fire overtake Maouelue's senses.  An acrid, acidic taste hits the back of his throat, and he gags, inhaling even more of the phantom remnants of imagined flames.  His body temperature rises instantly and Maouelue is overcome with heat, causing his armor to heat as well, burning to the touch.  A powerful voice overtakes his mind, adding to the pain and chaos of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"<i>You</i> are not the Queen.  Where is she?  When will my torment end?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue feels that this voice, if it were embodied, would like to do harm to everything and everyone.  Then his mind flashes back to the wizard trapped in the dungeon.  And the shadow dragon shut up there as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He staggers back, reeling and attempting to maintain his balance in light of the horror. He should be more careful with his communion henceforth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The voice stays with Maouelue, the feel of the flames, the false smoke he inhales with every breath.  </p><p></p><p>"I asked, <i>WHO</i> are <i>YOU</i>?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I am Lumao. And I am here for your Queen.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hmmph.  She's not my Queen, Lumao.  She, along with a <i>very</i> long list of offenders, have trapped me in this hell...  this...  limbo.  One which, even with all of my considerable powers, I cannot undo.  Find a way to destroy this cage I am in, Lumao, and I will grant you treasure and power beyond your every desire."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I already have a dragon patron, one of pure radiant life, light that would scour your darkness from this realm. No, I think you are here for good reason."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The growl resounds around the mages brain...  </p><p>(Constitution saving throw, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ringing abates slightly, but does not go away.  The growl turns into a roar, and at the pinicle, the dragon says, "Today I add Lumao on my list of enemies to <i>vanquish</i> upon my GLORIOUS return!"  </p><p></p><p>And with that, he fades from Lumao's mind.   The marble phases out to the group's eyes, almost as if a blur spell had been cast on it.  As quickly as it comes, it goes.  Bellatrix, Benna, and the Man-Faced-Dog(tm) all look at the mage curiously.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shaken, he turns to the others. “Let’s move.” He offers nothing else.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group looks around for signs of exits.  There is a doorway E, leading to the crystal room.  There is a doorway NW, and another straight S, leading out of the hall of statues.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They head NW to the door and peer in.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue grips the side of the wall as he peers into the next room.  An edge of a block of stone is just slippery enough to make the mage's armor <i>scrape</i> and a large face turns in his direction.</p></div>
