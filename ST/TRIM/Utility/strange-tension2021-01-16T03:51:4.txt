<div class="character-1"><p>Daran rushes to the Dragon Mage and pours a greater healing potion down his gullet.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran and Maouelue huddle together to try and fend off the remaining threats.  At the same time, the one lone goblin cannot control the wagon.  It careens into the black muck.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin jumps off and takes...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He stands and rushes at the melee.  (Gets there next round.)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The malleated  Metal Mage, much maligned, manages to massacre many mobs, morosely melting into the moist moss a mess.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, completely out of character for him, hugs Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank you, friend.  I thought I was dead and gone, there."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I thought the same of myself! You've saved me YET AGAIN!," He fairly weeps in relief at his new friend."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran realizes they're on the edge of a devil bog, and he pulls Maouelue away a bit further.  After they move a safe distance away, he says, "What do you think happened to our eladrin friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[3500 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm not sure...I heard him fleeing as I fell back there. Could be anywhere, though perhaps he will have taken vantage of our situation. Could have used a few spare arrows for that one though..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue unstoppers a large red potion that the Sister had prepared for just such an occasion. "Drink up Daran. We'll need our strength about us. I've just reset, but am near depleted after that last fracas. We may do well to find somewhere to recover yet again, but first let us investigate."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He feels a sanguine relief flow through him, this time only spilling a few drops from his parched lips onto his plate mail, the cool blue metal seeming to drink in the red as it fades in to the iridescent sheen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He heads over to the wreckage of the goblin cart to glean what he can about this horde, picking through the bodies and exploring the mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Casually he quaffs another cuppa.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaaaaah, that does it," he remarks as the second large bottle of red disappears down the hatch.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hands the vial back.  "I've got magics still to help with that, thank ye though."  He inspects the wagon with you, carefully.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two watch as the crazy wagon weapon sinks into the mire.  It's about half in now, but Maouelue sees a couple packs on the back of the machine.  The smoke has stopped now, and a couple good dex or acrobatic checks could get you there and back with the packs.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is a bit too heavy.  When he tries to jump, he lands a few feet from it, square in the black sludge.  (Con save and then dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gets a rope out of his pack and quickly tosses it to the mage.</p></div>
