strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Daran seems beat up, but generally fine.  Nothing a few healing potions won't cure.  And definitely nothing Maouelue hasn't experienced in the past.  Probably run-of-the-mill for the ranger.  As for Bellatrix, she's...  absolutely free and clear of any harm.  No bruises or cuts.  The only blood on her is smears of others' damages.  Which is...  strange.  Because Maouelue saw her get hit.  Several times.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage unstoppers one of the healing potions brewed by the Sister and offers it to Daran.</p><p></p><p>“You fought bravely Daran. I am in your debt yet again.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank you, Maouelue."  He takes the bottle and considers it before drinking half.  The mage watches as slices and punctures heal; Daran winces.  His posture straightens, then he gives the rest of the potion of healing to Otirnis, whose arm is in a makeshift cast.  A look passes between them, then Daran turns back to Maouelue.  "This was not what I expected.  Although, to be fair, I always expect a fight.  But this was nearly more than I was capable of.  Your company is much appreciated, in many ways."  The corner of his mouth twitches up.  And then Mao realizes, that is about as close to a smile that he's seen from the ranger.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods respectfully to Daran, giving him the grace of not prying any further.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He then turns to Bellatrix to examine her wounds, but upon looking, he is taken aback at the undamaged body before him. He marvels at the mysteries that seem to keep unfolding with this beguiling woman.</p><p></p><p>"My lady? You...that giant clubbed you beyond measure! How is it that you are unharmed?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, again demurely, to all in attendance.  Then she grabs Maouelue's arm and pulls him aside, a distance from the group.  Her fingers dig into his arm, painfully, yet her face is placid calmness.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Once a good 40 feet away, underneath the bough of a gorgeous willow tree, her countenance turns serious, worried.  Maouelue's elven attentions can see that she is nervous, her eyes occasionally dart around as if looking for something.  Or someone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm sorry for all of the cloak-and-dagger, but...  I might be in very big trouble.  That...  what happened...  at the end of the fight, with the dragon?  That..." she looks around, furtively.  "Mao, that wasn't me.  I didn't conjure that abomination."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue makes to shield their conversation from the main group by moving in front of Bellatrix with his back turned toward the rest.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't.....it wasn't you? What did you feel? What did it do to you? Your healing? Did it come from the drake?..."</p><p></p><p>He catches himself in his rush of questions, then pauses, and morphs his tone.</p><p></p><p>"You were unbelievable... I knew there was more to you than meets the eye, but....there was something else today. Something that I had not yet seen revealed. Breathtaking...."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She blushes, but still looks perturbed.  "You're pretty amazing yourself."  She moves a lock of jet black hair behind her ear.  "And yes, the healing, everything at the end...  It was like I was... inhabited."  She looks up at Maouelue, scared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We must find some time to delve further into this mystery, yet I fear if we conspire here much longer, our hosts' newfound acceptance may once again turn to suspicion. Let us make our way with the group and find rest ere long. There is much I would discuss with you <i>in confidence</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He fixes her with a soft yet penetrating gaze, then starts to offer his hands, but thinks twice and abashedly puts them away, turning back to the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The witch follows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Pardon our withdrawal good fellows. There was something of a, err, private matter we needed to discuss. Pray, let us get back to the matters at hand. Is everyone quite well enough to carry on, or are any more in need of healing ministrations?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis answers, looking at Erifias, "As long as we move slowly, I am ready to leave this place.  Allow me to lead us, liege?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group at large takes time to regenerate and renew their energies.  Amazingly, the ealdrin, Maouelue, and even Daran seem to completely heal.  Had it only been an hour?  Time does work strangely in the Feywild, and this sobers all to that realization.  Meanwhile, Bellatrix and her sister scour the wilderness for ingredients. Finally, when all were rested and repaired, Erifias says, "Well, now, I believe we are all in better health.  Let us make our way.   We can discuss things as we move.   Is that acceptable?"</p></div>
