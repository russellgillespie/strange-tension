He hands the promised last bottle of Golden Dragon Ale to Jaecob. </p><p></p><p>"Here,  you deserve this, <i>brother.</i>"</p><p></p><p>To Shelli, he pours out the contents of the bottle of Ver-poo-th.</p><p></p><p>"You were stunning, Shelli."</p><p></p><p>For Flayco, he offers up a bottle of Bubblegut Ale.</p><p></p><p>"Here, you've earned your fun. Go play around with your acid breath!"</p><p></p><p>He then pulls out the stopper on the remaining bottle of Gnomish whiskey.</p><p></p><p>"Now one for Doctor Druid."</p><p></p><p>He takes a stiff draught off the bottle, resolute not to flinch at the rubbing alcohol portion.</p><p></p><p>"You beautiful beasts...."</p><p></p><p><i>He turns and looks at the cryptex.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite make out the sequencing of the cryptex.  The book made it sound pretty simple, but looking at it now, it's anything but.  He can, however, touch the spinning columns and turn them without any of the adverse effects referenced by Lord Muhlen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes some time to go back over Muhlen’s notes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He deliberates over the spindles, examining each and every glyph upon them, searching for the resonances Muhlen referred to.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(How about this...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The journal mentions that Muhlen found the first symbol. Can Dieter any indication of which it was? Is there any chance of gleaning more from these incoherent writings? There is an itching curiosity to find more clues. How did Muhlen</i> </p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob looks at the druid and takes the book, hesitantly.  He starts pouring over the writings, getting deeper and deeper into it as the time goes on. (Do you have any magics that could aid him?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The Runemark stands up, excitedly, motioning to Dieter.  "Hey, I think I have it!  Here, let me check.  Is it safe?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ha! Safe!...Pardon my hearty guffaw there Jaecob, but when's the last time you felt <i>safe</i>... But I saw that blood in your eyes today. Aren't you <i>ready to know what your old man was after?</i> Wouldn't it be sweet to beat your brother to it? <i>If only to burn it all down...</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But I've got the Annulus. You should be safe from madness at the least."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter adds in what he hopes is a convincing tone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Feeling bolstered, he says, "Okay.  Here goes!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob deftly rolls the columns, looking at the book for reference.  The first clicks into place, then the second and third.  He looks strained, checking with Dieter to make sure he's still there.  Then, hands shaking slightly, turns the last column.  It clicks into place and stone starts grinding behind the western wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here...for your nerves.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter hands him the remainder of the Gnomish Whiskey for a job well done.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He tips it up while watching the wall closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Behind the cylinder, an invisible seal opens in the wall, opening a chamber behind it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid peers curiously at the opening door, his eye being pulled away momentarily by Flayco, whose bubble-gut acid spasms seemed to be coming now to a squelching, splattering, sizzling finale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli happily schlurps up the cherry poo goo and bleats.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His attention turns back to the wall at hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Stone grinds against stone, but no dust is made.  It seems this craftsmanship is very high end.  The smell is the first thing the group notices.  It is tangy, rotten, with notes of brine and the sea.  The irregularly shaped room is lined with tables and bookshelves.  A magical lamp crackles to life to illuminate a truly grizzly scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the table is an illithid, dead, in mid-post mortem.  It's chest has an incision down to his waist, the skin is splayed open and tacked to the table, presenting the innards of the creature.  The table beyond the operating bench is filled with gadgets and tools, all caked in dried blood and gristle.  Several books are opened on the surrounding shelving, including one standing open on a high stand close to the operation.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Stifling a retch, the two humans cover their faces with whatever means they can as they enter. Dieter sets a flame outside the door to draw out and purify the sickly air. Immediately Dieter begins looking for an internal door mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brushes a bit of residual goo off his shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the left side of the interior wall of the chamber, Dieter sees clearly a stone button trying to blend into the stone.  Just underneath that is a wooden switch, prominently stationed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I know it’s not much, but it’s home for now. Let’s close this up and take a rest while we sort through these tomes.” Dieter makes to close the outer door to the pit chamber and to seal the cryptex door using the hidden stone button, once they’ve aired things out as best they can that is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone button is pushed, the doors shut.</p></div>
