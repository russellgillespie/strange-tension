strange-tensionDieter has a hard time, but Maouelue is totally into it!  (Persuasion to bring Frume along, he's kinda on the fence about it.  The faces look too real...)

"Hoy, lads...  I don't know about knocking these statues over.  Look at the eyes on this one?!  No way an artist can do this, am I right?!"



The druid and the mage start setting fire to the clay statues.  It takes a bit to start them up, and Frume is not really taking part in it.  He's going around the room examining the statues and pillars.
*Once the blaze begins to feed on itself slowly, the two begin to inspect the rest of the room with Frume.*
A growl comes from the E end of the room.
*The party draws blades. Dieter dabbles one of the standard poison vials on the silvers of his staff.*
A second growl couples with the other as two animals lumber in through the E entrance.

"Holy gods..."  Frume stumbles to get his crossbow out.
Hm.  Ok sweet

Frume moves along the side of the wall and gets a sharp pain in the back of his head.  It happened as he looked at the animal in the eyes.   This might be more difficult that he originally thought...

He tries to shoot without looking at it directly.  The bolt goes wide.
"We might have a *PROBLEM* here!!"








While one tries to bite Maouelue and misses, the other charges Dieter, turning it's gaze on the druid.  A hardness starts coming over his body.  (In 1d4 rounds he will be turned to stone - at the moment he is just restrained.)
"Oh gods, are you okay Dieter?!"  He tries to sling another bolt at the creature.

He hides behind a column.
*Maouelue attempts to hold the platinum dragon on his shield directly into the basilisk’s eyes.*

The basilisk rears and roars.  The roar turns to a shriek of pain.  The creature has stopped moving on the opposite side of the shield.
*Dieter hears his friend’s plea and tries to turn, with legs that keep getting heavier, to his backpack. He pulls out the mirror...he said he wouldn’t look. But he needn’t. Just one of them.*
*Dieter raises the henchmen mirror high at his assailant!*

The roars of the two basilisks slowly turning to stone is shrill, piercing.  Their pain doesn't last long as they turn quite quickly.

Frume suggests, "I'm going back to the room and turn the fucking thing over."

*Maouelue begins to say a few words of prayer.*
There are a couple things that can help.  A potion made of the mandrake root can cure, but it takes a bit to brew and work.  The spell Greater Restoration would work for sure, Lesser Restoration may.

*Dieter brushes a bit of stone dust of his shoulder.*
After the scare of the basilisks, Frume decides to sit on the ground and close his eyes, breathing deeply.
"What the hell, lads...  What the hell is going on?"
The two adventurers see the beleaguered man take a deep, deep breath.  Eyes close again and he says, "I've was tracking a group of orcs that attacked a village about a tenday ago.  The village guards put up a fight, but they were really no match for the lot.  I was just coming back to my village from an excursion abroad when I found the people decimated."
"I tracked the bastards down, started picking them off one by one.  You should have seen them, they didn't know what the fuck was happening!"  He laughs, joylessly.
"Eventually they came into this cave system, I've been slowly taking them down e'er since.  Take a souvenir with every one, too."  Shows you some patches of what you can only guess is orc hide.
"Haven't decided what to make yet.  Maybe I'll just use 'em to wipe me arse, eh?!"  He laughs again.


*Maouelue quaffs another potion.*
"Aye.  I should probably be on my way as well, boyos.  Can't imagine what state the homestead is with me being gone so long."
"I wouldn't mind the company up, much appreciated sirs."
*The party heads back down the hall and turns at the previous corridor, seeking out its last unexplored nooks.*
The party enters the warrens again, the tatters and bowl of grease were left as before.  There is a exit from this room to the E and to the S.
*They take the left way.*
The sight that greets the three men is one that will stick with them for some time.  A crude throne is set up in the NE corner of the rectangular room.  On it sits a humanoid made of dirt, dung, bits of roots from the walls and floor, and any old thing that happened to be scavenged or lying around.  It stinks here due to this shit idol, but also because...
Seven fungal goblins are praising it in the mire in front of the throne.  What makes them fungal goblins, the adventurers may ask?  Simply put, there is any and all sorts of fungal varieties adorning each and every one.  Some are even phosphorescent, giving a few of the goblins a odd glow to their skin.
