<div class="character-1"><p>The carnage culminates with the last wall falling outwards toward the cave mouth opening, with a large <i>crash</i>.  Daran starts slicing up some of the yetis and flying beasts.  (Nature check for what they are and for any salvageable bits.  Perception or investigation if you want to check out the cave more.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's never heard of these things before, but the pelts on the yeti and the flying beasts should be warm and fetch a fair price.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group gathers to look through the cave properly.  Maouelue, being very curious, finds that the cave rounds at the middle, where the bulk of the fighting took place, and tapers at the entrance and farther in.  There is a crevice at the very end of the cave, cracked through the rock.  It is...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The group sets to work on the yetis and their flying companions.  After a time, and after setting up a nice big fire, they're able to set a few pelts together, curing in the heat.  Plus, several steaks are on a spit, fat dripping and sizzling on the cookfire.</p><p></p><p>Daran sets out to check the walls, then the outside, then scouts up ahead for other animals and the general lay of the land.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>He gets a pretty good sense on the direction.  If they were to continue in the direction of the gash, they would be going toward the Fortress.  Generally, and that's if the cavern moves straight.  Once down there, it would be hard to tell the direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hawk-turned-bat squeeks then hops/flies down the small shaft.  Almost 80 ft further in, the crack opens up into a fairly large cavern.  The bat can only see midway through, mostly inky blackness and stalactites greet him.  However, he is able to glimpse, just as he gets to the edge of the telepathic connection, a floor several dozen feet below, with scattered pools of water around.  He detected no movement or life in the pass or the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"This would be the time to have a Druid around...", Maouelue says, reminiscing about the <i>many</i> times Dieter would transform randomly into a spider or aught else and bugger off into a cavern. He allows himself a small chuckle that, surprisingly, offers a glimpse of an inner heat that more than matches that of the fire. The investigator notes this curiously and files it away as he considers how best to approach the situation without a shapeshifter in company.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran wrestles the steaks from the fire, carving them up for everyone to try.  (Con saves!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran tears into them, but a couple leave Maouelue and the sisters wanting.  They're nourishing enough, and everyone keeps down their meals.  After a time, the group is ready to explore!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The walls inside the cave pass are smooth, water-worn, and cold.  After the warm fire, it sends a shiver up the wizards back.  (How far is he moving in?)</p></div>
