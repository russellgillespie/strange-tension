There will be time for revelry, just as there will be time to mourn.  Might not happen all at once, either.  Might have to take those emotions when you can get them.  Gods know I understand."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Lumao fixes him with a piercing stare. Then a quick nod. And onward.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Tell me Daran, about this one...this one that I reminded you of. If...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A ways down following the stream, you come to a path that leads due W.  Although it's away from Oakhurst, Daran says, "Let's take this route.  It's round about, but we should be out of the sights of the brigands."  He's quiet for a bit more, then starts walking.  "Her name was Lura.  She was my wife.  She was...  taken too soon.  It's a long story.  And one that hasn't been told before.  Not yet, at least.  Tell you what," he says, looking back at you, "We break your friend out, it'll be our next campfire story.  That's a promise."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I like you Daran. Thank you for opening yourself to me. Some day you can tell me why a traveler such as yourself would take one such as me on. I do think you have saved my life and Bahamut willing...Dieter’s too.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "There has to be good out there in the world.  Gods know I've seen too much bad, so there has to be good out there.  We just have to find it.  We're well met, Lamao."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The sound of scraping wakes him up.  A food tray with bread and some moldy cheese is slid under the door, letting sparse light in.  From what he can tell, he's in a medium sized cell; hard oaken door with iron bandings, a barred window and a section at the bottom of the door where food plates can be delivered.  The walls are rough stone, but everything smells damp and mildew-y here. </p><p></p><p> He is tied to a dilapidated, rotten wooden bedframe.  He's bound in iron shackles.  His pack and items have been taken from him.  He is not alone.  As his eyes adjust, the druid can see a humanoid-sized lump of something on the bed across from him.  Soft breathing can be heard and seen from the lump.  </p><p></p><p>The bed to his right has a man, sitting cross-legged, carving something.  The man twirls a toothpick in his mouth and hums softly as he works.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first thing Dieter does is try to use his powers to turn into an animal.  He focuses...  and it's strange. Normally he can feel the warp and weave of the natural magic around him.  Now, he just feels the cold emptiness of dank, damp air.  He shivers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Shit. Shit shit shit! What am I going to do. Where the hell is Maouelue?... Shit. What a mess back there. And the henchmen! Uuuuugh. The hallucination, the battle, now this? Dear me...no magic...what is this foul darkness. After so long underground, a breath of light and air and trees....but now this. Sigh. Time to get down to it Dieter. We've got to figure a way out of this mess. Yes. Yes we do.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter quickly shuts his eyes, but leaves one half cracked open. He lies there trying to get his bearings without being noticed awake.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter blinks several times as his vision comes to. He takes in the carving main's appearance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume stares back at you, whittling but not watching what he is doing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A pall permeates Dieter's face. His core seems to turn to an anvil. There's no avoiding this now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So we meet again."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Was wondering when you'd be waking, laddie.  Howse the body?  Anything broken?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Does <i>spirit</i> count?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He frowns, shrugs, thinks.  "No.  I suppose you thought you'd win that fight.  Hells be true, I thought you would as well.  Came through everything else.  Was hoping to have this conversation with the both of you boys, too, but here we are.  Don't think of it as a knock on your talents, lad.  That magus friend of yourn is...  he's a wily one!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume stops carving, stands and stows the knife and wood.  He squats on his haunches next to you, like he's ready for a quiet conversation.   He motions to the shackles.  "May I?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks at him cautiously, questioningly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Just what is your role in all this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "At the moment?  Just trying to get these off'n ye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter nods in assent</p></div>
