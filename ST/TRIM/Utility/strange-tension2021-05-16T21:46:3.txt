<div class="character-1"><p>The hag jumps on the back of the elk, just to make sure she can effect it.  Once on, she starts crushing it with her body.  Maouelue hears a heavy <i>MWAAAWR</i> and sees the beast fall under the hag.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The hag, mouth bloodied with a piece of meat ripped from the elk, looks towards Maouelue and jumps to bite at him.  As she finds a soft spot in his armor, she is blasted backwards.  Recovering, she tries again!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Almost time.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, dearie...  this has been fun.  But I might have to meet you again...  with my sisters."  She wipes blood off her gross mouth, then holds her bloody, dripping hands out.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Immediately, a fog encircles the room.  Maouelue hears a <i>thud</i> from within the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue pushes his way through the fog trying to make out the source of the noise.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue senses that a door has opened and closed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue is getting quite unsettled now. Fully depleted, unable to see, hurting badly from a long long day, he heaves heavily. He feels his way around gingerly to the edge of the room to try and find a door, hoping to at least open it and disperse some of this fog. He is in grave danger now.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage reaches out, finds the wall, and is able to find a door.  (Go through?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He listens at the door a moment hoping not to hear any voices behind.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fighting and booming is still coming from all around, but there doesn't seem to be voices directly behind the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He opens it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens to a long hall lines with cots.  All are in disarray, as if people were pulled away in a hurry.  Sounds of fighting is getting louder.  There is a small hall on the N wall, and there is another door on the W wall, 100 feet away.  Each cot has a small chest by it's foot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue makes to lock or barricade both doors as best he can, then looking through a few of the footlockers to see what he might use to his advantage. </p><p></p><p>“I hope this works...” he thinks to himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doors are barricaded, the sounds of fighting move closer.  Each trunk has something in it.  Maouelue finds four potions of healing, six standard daggers, three sets of noble's clothes, one vial of drow poison, one potion of invisibility, and one holy symbol of Llolth.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue thanks the stars that some luck seems to come his way. He quaffs a potion greedily.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His thirst sets in like one who has been long in the desert. He unstoppers another.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He burps a bit, grossly resounding in his steel helm.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue slumps into the remotest corner of the room far away from the doors after tidying up the chests as best he can. He holds the potion of invisibility at the ready and harries himself in to the most functional of reveries. He meditates on all he has been told and all he has read of Mag Tureah. His mind palace's walkways merge with the dark corridors of the keep...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue thinks on Mag Tureah, and remembers almost immediately that it is a Fomorian stronghold, with ogres and goblins and unseelie en masse.  A twinge hits him that...  where he is now...  is not Mag Tureah.  It is the Fortress of the Queen of Air and Darkness, her secret, hidden keep.  There should be another crystal here, one that should get him back to the Pale Prince's keep.  The sounds of fighting must be the Summer Court's forces... but that would mean either a good amount of time has passed (which is highly likely) or that the Summer Court possibly changed their strategy.  Or it might be a civil insurrection, too...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue meditates in the corner, resting as much as he can in the enemy's bunker.  Complete with the short/long rest, he comes to hearing the fighting has ebbed away slightly.</p></div>
