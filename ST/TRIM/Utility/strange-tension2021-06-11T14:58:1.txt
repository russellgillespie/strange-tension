strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>After some time, with a few restless coughs and murmurs from the gathered Eladrin, Maouelue stands at the full, his emblazoned shield radiant in the half-light.</p><p></p><p>"If a more physical approach is indeed needed, Illafarea, then let it be so!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He smashes the Giantess Bracers together, the surprised crowd taking several <i>giant steps</i> back!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin back up, astonished.  A small smile comes to Illafaera's lips.   A strange sense of tension hangs in the air.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>May my luck be better than my track record with this...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace glances off the crystal, narrowly missing an archer eladrin on the follow through.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An urge take Maouelue...  but only momentarily.   He felt, for some odd reason, as if he should turn his mace on his fellow eladrin...  Thankfully, the feeling leaves as quickly as it comes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He shakes it off, tries again...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Again, the overwhelming feeling on harming his fellow soldiers comes over him, but Maouelue is made of tougher stuff.  He shakes it off, and a small voice inside his head says, "Tut tut, you shouldn't be trying to <i>destroy</i> it...  You should be trying to <i>merge</i> with it.  Imagine the <i>power</i>!  Imagine how you would wield this artifact.  The entire Feywild would be at your mercy..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue grimaces, feeling the urge toward the promise of power, but finds the calm impassive righteousness embodied by his patron, lord of dragons. </p><p></p><p><i>This is not for glory. This is not for impunity. This is for unity!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I will find the strength!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I will finish this fight!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Over and over the Metal Mage, majestically mirroring the chardalyn and himself back into infinitely smaller and smaller refractions, bashes the crystal, as if he is working out destroying more than just the object at hand. He sees himself looking back at himself looking back at himself looking back at himself...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The massive hit lands and a wave of energy flashes out from the center of the hit.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few keep their feet, but half fall to the floor, knocked back by the unseen force.  Bellatrix falls, Maouelue does as well, both reaching for each other as the blast pushes them backwards onto the cold stone floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A cruel laugh starts from the middle of the now shaking chardalyn crystal.  It quickly dies away as the ground rumbles, the shard shakes more violently.  Then, it starts contracting, pulling it's many flutes and spires downward and inward, becoming a smaller version of itself rapidly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Cracked stone from the ceiling falls inward as the crystal retracts from the top of the room.  It quickly descend and recedes into the floor, where it disappears in a matter of seconds, leaving a gaping wound in the castle.  Everyone looks at each other.  The screaming is still happening.  People look from one to the other.  Maouelue and Bellatrix peer from eladrin to eladrin, trying to find the source of the cries.  The scream intensifies...  then they see her.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All are backing away from Illafaera, who is holding her head with both hands, kneeling on the ground, and screaming so hard spittle and mucus are leaking from her head in heavy drops.  Maouelue realizes quickly that the woman could not possibly have any more breath in her body, yet the screaming continues.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out, trying to stabilize the tortured Illafaera...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She suddenly throws her head back as a small purple-black ball rises from the hole in front of the golden eladrin.  Like a black hole surrounded by wisps of purple lightning, the ball hovers...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(You're good!)</p><p>Maouelue, is his boundless feeling for his fellow being, reaches out and touches the elf wizard.  His mind splits, arcing down the center, then bifurcates into more, many more, until thousands of voices are in his head, screaming, crying, retching, whispering ill omens and even worse promises of murder, torture, death.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The small ball of negative light rises until it is above the group, with everyone watching.</p></div>
