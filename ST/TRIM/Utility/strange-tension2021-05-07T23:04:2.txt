strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>“Psh...works in all the old stories...” he adds petulantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>I bet Snarr would have gotten it...</i>” he jibes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Considering again, he thinks back to the line about the jewels around the neck. He cajoles Elkamigo over and remounts to get a better look at the top of the Giant form and to peer down inside the armor plate.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Elkamigo allows the heavy mage hop upon it's huge back, but Maouelue doesn't see any 'jewels' or anything of the like around the frost giant's neck.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well, I didn’t want to do this...but...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He thinks a moment, “Back up Elkamigo.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He hops down and shoots a stream of flame at the placard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tree.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue speaks the word, the giant word resounds around the room, and the air feels like it is being drawn away.  To the E, the polished metal doors move inward, slowly, scraping against the frozen floor.  An odd green glow comes from within the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue turns to meet the glow, the steel and platinum of his armor iridescent in reflection. He approaches the precipice and peers in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Emerald green fills the mages eyes as he peers into a modest sized room that is completely engulfed by an enormous, leafy tree.  Leaves spill over an impossibly large trunk whose roots are digging into the ice and stone of the castle.  From the base of the tree to about halfway up it's trunk is a rime of ice, threatening the life blood of the massive structure.  As the wizard looks closer, there are a few leaves, scattered here and there, that look to be frosting over as well.  Glinting near the center of the large bough system is a golden apple, a single fruit, hanging down within arms reach of the mage.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, isn't it.  You see, I stole this tree from another world, and brought it here...  just to watch it die," the feathery voice says in Maouelue's ear.  "That golden apple is the heart of a new world, or could be.  The wood from that tree can create magical items that can transport people anywhere their heart's desire.  To any plane, any space...  any life, perhaps.  One would say it's a travesty that I have imprisoned this wonderful thing in a place such as this, just to kill it.  I would prefer it did not have to happen.  But I cannot allow what it stands for.  I cannot allow it's hope to infect anyone else."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Would you like to see the last test?  Or, at least, the last test originally planned for the heir to the dragon mark?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Mage stoically nods his silent consent.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue could swear he hears a heavy sigh as a blue-white portal appears on the edge of the S wall.  Within, the mage can see a simple, yet unoccupied, tavern room.  A plain wooden table has a white cloth on it.  Maouelue can see something is underneath the cloth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage walks into the room, and as he does so, the cover dissolves away, showing the mage a series of wizard's wands.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one at the farthest left looks to be made of solid gold, set with rubies.  Next is a polished wand of a black substance, somewhere between wood and stone.   The third is an intricately carved white-wood wand, extremely ornate and delicate.  The fourth is a thick wand, made of a tough wood, and is set with small crystals and gems that twinkle. </p><p> It also has runes etched all along it.  Last is what looks to be a stick, twisted at odd angles, scarred along an edge as if from a lightning strike.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A voice comes to Maouelue - <i>"Choose."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(They're in Sylvan, so he sees...)</p><p><i>No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out and lifts the fifth wand, testing its balance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a heavy wood, weighing down his hand as he picks it up.  It surprises him, the heft of it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He closes his eyes to the material world around him and tries to connect with the source within the wand, if there indeed is any.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
