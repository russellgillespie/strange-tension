He pulls out a small jagged metal bit, and proceeds to unlock Dieter's bonds.  Once they're off, he sets them quietly on the floor, with a finger pressed against his lips in a, <i>Shhh</i> motion.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The continuously re-bewildered druid sets his bare feet down silently on the cold hard ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So, when you boys didn't come quietly, the boss...  he didn't like that very much.  Sent me to keep old Culver company here.  He's been unconscious for awhile now, nothing I can do to wake him.  Funny thing about these old places," he steps to a dark corner of the cell.  He studies it a moment, then kicks out with a dirty boot.  A small section of the wall moves in, a flicker of light can be seen below.  "Secrets abound."  He smiles again at you. </p><p></p><p>"Here's the thing.  There's going to be a guard coming down the way in a few.  They check up on us, but not always consistently.  My guess, if we wait for the next pass, then leave right after, we should get a good head start, eh?"</p><p></p><p>"Plus...  leaves us time to catch up."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye. But...how do I know I can trust you? You say 'The Boss' like a joiner. Pardon my wariness, but...as you can imagine..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"...my instinct to trust is a bit...riven."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"To be expected, to be expected for sure.  And you can't trust me.  Shouldn't trust me, I should say.  I don't work at causes, but I 'join' where the money is.  Or power.  Truthfully," he leans in, "I'm in it for the loot, lad!  I'd rather rob a thousand houses, crawl through a million forgotten dungeons, if I can find a lost artifact or ancient text.  Not that I can use any of that shite.  But they do fetch a pretty sum, to the right buyers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"In an effort to be a bit more trustworthy, I should say <i>that's</i> the real reason I was down in those caves.  I'd been looking for that tomb for some time, now.  Got what we could, but I didn't find all of what the boss was after.  He's pissed about that, too.  Oh well.   What are ye gonna do, am I right?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Mercenaries...<i>Fight for a cause, but don't die for it...</i> That's how the saying goes, right?," He considers a moment. "Well, I'm no stranger to a bit of loot lust either, but I won't forsake my companions." His eyes turn to Culver. "We must do something about him. What's his part in all this. That's where it all started for Maouelue and me. I would see our rescue completed if such a cause be just."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks over at the lump on the bed.  He sucks his teeth, considering.  "The old man has taken a beating, that's for sure.  But don't you worry yourself about it, he wasn't taken on your account.  Word around the water barrel is that he owed the boss some money, decided to renege on his side of the bargain.  Him meeting you boys was incidental at best.  The boss decided to use his disappearance to lure you both, that's about all.  He'll come around soon, hopefully.  You good with leaving him here if we have to?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter agonizes over this a moment. "I suppose we've gotten in enough trouble on his account already. Aye, we'll leave him if needs be. But, it sounds like this Boss has a comeuppance in his future...I'll make sure of that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shrugs and sits back down on his dingy cot.  The mildew smell is quite strong and he coughs, spits into an empty corner of the room.  "So, did you find out more about that bastard Muhlen?  Any more tricks up his sleeve in that goblin infested hovel he called a vault?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"More than a few tricks indeed. I'm not sure if we found more of his after you...did you run or were you taken?...I suppose it matters little at this point. We forged a bit of our own fortune down there, then sought sanctuary above. Only to find...well, I guess you know that part now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I have a question though...what in the bloody hells happened to my power down here?"</p></div>
