strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The first thing you notice that he's very nimble.  He wears brown and dark green cloaks and leather, blending into the surrounding greenery.  As he gets closer Maouelue sees his lined and weary face, the face of a man that has either had too many quests or been on a very long mission for a very long time.  He strides up confidently, loosening his pack and sitting down cross-legged in front of the wizard.</p><p></p><p>"Good morn and well met, stranger.  It seems you might be in need of assistance.  Your friend has just...  vanished."  He doesn't seem particularly taken aback by this.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"He...does that. They call me...Lumao...and you are?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Most just call me ranger.  Names Daran, though.  You in trouble, son?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Heh...I suppose you could say that..."</p><p></p><p>"What gave me away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You look a bit worse for the wear, to be honest.  Running from or to yer trouble, then?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Would it mean anything to you if I told you I don't much know the difference anymore?"</p><p></p><p><i>He loosens a strap on his armor and takes his helmet off for the moment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man lets out a very subdued, but somehow very grandfatherly, paternal laugh.  "Aye, aye."  He looks around the area eagle-eyed, taking everything in.  "If you need anything to eat, I'm about to restart my cookfire.  Just over the rise there."  He gets up and nods to you.  Then heads back across the river.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You can see as he crosses the basically broken bridge that you'll have to be nimble or careful to get across. The stream doesn't seem deep or dangerous, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmph...Seems friendly enough... Got to keep your wits about you now though <i>Lumao</i>..."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>He must go to him. He must. And perhaps he must trust in this man as well. Ranger...Daran...sure, why not?</i></p><p></p><p>"Come on lady of fate...let's dance again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He packs his things, hanging the mace from his belt, just in case...then heads off over the river. He pulls a quarterstaff from his bag to steady himself across the river. He would have to remember to thank the proprietors at Bags of HoldingÂ Inc. they sure did make good products.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue hops across the bridge pretty deftly.  Some areas creak, but nothing falls off.  Thinking on the ranger, you get a good feeling about him.  Seemed honest and soft spoken.  The scars are definitely badges of honor from battle.  He didn't seem shy about anything.  You can probably ask him more about them without offending him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hullo there! Turns out it does get a bit cold sitting out overnight in this stuff..." <i>He tugs at his plate collar.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Offer still good to take a warm up here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pull up a stump."  He has started the kindling on fire and is starting to put larger sticks on.  His pack is open and there are utensils out, a few packages of things, and there are two small rabbits trimmed and ready to be cooked.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thanks.... Do you come from these parts Daran?  You seem well traveled."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, well," he cracks more sticks ands adds them to the burgeoning fire.  "Been here, been there.  Been living south of here for quite a number of years.  Thundertree, if you ken of it.  Most of it's overrun now.  You ever cooked coney?"  He pulls out a small cookpan.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I've mainly stayed with flora rather than fauna over the years, but those do look delectable. Thundertree you say? Sounds familiar, but I can't be sure. Do you happen to have a map you could point it out with?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Also, if you're familiar with these parts, have you seen this place?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He holds out the veteran's second map.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He chuckles.  "This is...  bad.  This is chicken scratch!  Let me see..."  He pours over it, scratching his chin.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
