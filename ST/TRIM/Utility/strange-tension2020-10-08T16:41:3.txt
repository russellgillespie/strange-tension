<div class="character-1"><p>Around midday, Kirra comes in with foodstuffs and drinks.  Douglas follows shortly after, carrying a large pack on his back.  He has procured a shield as well; a solidly built oaken shield with the crest of the town on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hiya fellas!  What's to eat, I'm starving!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group welcomes Douglas and takes a short rest while they take their luncheon and fill him in on their tidings.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group finishes their rest and gets up from the table.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I would like to take our silver and this chest over to the Saynea at the forge.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas, still stuffing bacon and biscuits in his pockets for later, says, "Right.  I'm on it," and exits hastily. </p><p>Kirra nods, saying, "He should be back any moment now.  Unless there were other things for the Council to discuss.  They're our elders of the town, and sometimes it takes a bit to get them all together at the same time.  Should be about finished, though, I'd expect."  She smiles at the two of you and continues cleaning the remains of the meal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gives a cursory nod then turns back to his vittles. Maouelue’s eyes however, linger a while on Kirra as he smiles back, perhaps a bit more broadly than usual.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two adventurers make themselves comfortable while they await the return of their host.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A couple hours later, Maouelue and Dieter start to get a little worried, Denson still isn't back yet.  Minutes later, you hear loud banging from down the hall, towards the rooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both jump up at the sound and immediately go to investigate the sound source.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As they approach the damaged section of the building, hammering and sawing sounds grow louder.  The scene displays itself as a group of burly men handling lumber and tools, working at an extremely fast pace in rebuilding the fire-affected room.  Denson is there, directing the work.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Friends!  Looks like we'll have this back up and running in no time, eh?  Glad Kirra was able to assist you gentlemen.  As for the Council," he says, looking around, "let us away to a more secluded spot.  One with less ears, eh?!"   He leads you out of the room and to a locked door past the kitchens.  The room is comfortable for the three, chairs are offered.  Denson pulls a dark brown bottle of something and three glasses. He sets them out on the table, pours a thick amber liquid, and knocks the bottle against them, offering them up.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He swigs his in one, grimaces while he sets the glass back down.  He pours another while he starts talking. </p><p>"There are five elders of the Oakhurst Council.  They are all venerated members of this community; business owners, folks that have lived here their entire lives.  Which says a lot, because we're kind-of known as a transition town.  People come, people go.  Not too man stay, if you catch my drift."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Five make all of the government-type decisions facing the town.  They also tend to know the scuttlebutt before anyone else.  They keep things close to their collective vests, however.  The rest of us just find a way to...  work within their system.  Don't get me wrong, they are fair, good people.  They take a deep responsibility for this town. Their town.  With that being said, they'd like to meet with you.  Tonight, to be to the point."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I said I would ask you fellows.  There's no pressure, you don't have to meet with them if you'd rather not.  I did pass along your message, Master Wizard.  They are...  intrigued.  No one's really expressed interest, especially at this level.  I believe they want to share with you some information to help you...  To help solidify your choice.  Or not.  Guess it's up to you lads."  He smiles and sips at his drink.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue each take their drinks in one and set them down.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Pardon our haste, but we must not dally. Culver suffers dearly for each passing moment we delay. We have...seen it.”</p></div>
