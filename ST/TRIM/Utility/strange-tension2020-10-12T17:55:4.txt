strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"A-yuh, that sounds about right, we need to convene immediately."  He dons his hat.  "Lemme check on some things at the house, I'll put a word out to everyone to meet.  There is a building we use as the Council meeting area, but I'm afraid it's not available at the moment.  We'll just have to have them come here, does that work for y'all?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group nods in assent. Everyone is nervous, but this seems an amicable accord thus far. Eyes remain open, but guard is lowered ever slightly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, one more thing," he says, tightening his gaze on the Maouelue, Dieter, and Bellatrix.  "This Douglas.  You, uh...  You still have the body?  Because if you do, I'd say we might want to bring him here, post-haste."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue glances at Bellatrix.</i></p><p>"We...had not time to intern it, but we have tried to secure it best we could. It's back at Trix's. Might should we head there together once the council is joined?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell you what," he turns and whistles at a nearby farm hand on a horse.  "One of you can go with Heston here and retrieve the body.  We might start without you, but no one is going to do anything without seeing Douglas's body."  With that, he makes a clicking sound with his cheek, nods to you all, and runs into the farmhouse at  good pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter obliges and makes great haste as he reassures Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you enter the farmhouse, there are a couple older boys receiving orders from Vam.  </p><p>"Go round them up and bring them back here, double time.  Git going."</p><p>The boys dash out the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's fiddling becomes more intense as they wait. Creeping cryogenic crystals begin to form on the orbs' surfaces, stretching out from frosty fingertips.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam doesn't see.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gazes around the farmhouse, taking in his surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A handful of minutes pass.  A knock comes at the door and an older man with broad shoulders and a bald head peeks in.  His hands are large, gnarly, he's still wearing a smock of slick leather.  His face is lined, worn.  He looks extremely worried and says, "Vam, what's all this about needing to meet right away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sizes the man up with a glance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees a very nicely kept homestead.  Plain wood beams and walls cover the interior, sawdust is on the floor.  Everything looks worn but very naturally so.  There are saddles hung over a bannister that leads to a cellar, it seems.  There is a second floor as well.  The main floor of the house is one big room, encompassing kitchen, sitting room, dining area, and foyer all in one.  There is a small hallway off to the right of the wizard, which ends with a couple doors, one on either side of the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks capable of handling himself in a fight, he's burly, strong.  He exudes an air of timidity, though.  Other than that, Maouelue doesn't get a real solid vibe about him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks tentatively from Vam to you, very timid, very nearly backs out of the doorway.  Vam waves the big man in, and he stops his retreat.  He says, "Mm...  My name is Bazad.  I'm here for the Council meeting."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He nods, shakes your hand rather quickly, then goes over to speak with Vam.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue casts a glance at Bellatrix and takes note of the increasing awkwardness of Veena's caged form.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves semi-casually to obscure it from immediate view.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another knock on the door.  A portly, middle-aged man comes in while he's knocking.  He wears a sense of importance like a cloak.  You get the sense he might have been muscular at one time, but he's let that go for quite a while.  </p><p></p><p>He strides in, making eye contact with Vam and Bazad, then says loudly, "Who in the hell called this meeting.  I know Vam couldn't have been this idiotic, so who's responsible for taking me away from my business?  And at closing time, nonetheless?"  His eyes fall on the wizard and the witch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A realization hits Maouelue as a mental flash...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Veena has not moved or blinked since she's been caged.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What the hell does that mean?!"  He looks around from person to person, arms flailing in the air.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Fear not her cage. She has been placed in stasis in order that we might secure her from flight."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And I beg your pardon sir, I go by the name of Maouelue. My partner Dieter has gone with some of Vam's hands to retrieve...our friend's body."</p></div>
