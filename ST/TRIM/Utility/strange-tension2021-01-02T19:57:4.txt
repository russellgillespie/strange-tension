strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter immediately loses all sense of fear at seeing the baby animal, his druidic roots coming to the fore. He begins to lock eyes with it and tries to tend to it as best he can. He speaks to it softly and offers it some water.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby, wet and scrabbling for purchase, looks up at Dieter.  Cocking its head, it tries to understand.  Seeing the waterskin, he cocks its head to the other side, reminding Dieter a bit of a newborn puppy.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco's tentacles creep over the water, and the baby <i>sloughs</i> over to it to drink.  While drinking, an errant tentacle searches out for the rations.  It wraps around the food, and immediately, passes it over in search of other nibbles.  It finishes with the water, opens its eyes, and blinks; first one eye, then the other, then both together.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then it sees the unconscious Jaecob on the floor.  It cocks its head...  and moves toward the prone man.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rushes over and gets in between Flayco and Jaecob. “No!” He sternly gestures with a raised finger. “We’ll find you summat else to eat Flayco.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli, trembling, moves into her Shell Defense.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Remembering the black dragon whelp and the pantry, Dieter begins thinking about next steps while he awaits Flayco’s response.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby dragon cocks its head at Dieter, not quite understanding.  Shelli is so large, the illithi-dragon doesn't understand it to be a being.  However, it turns back to it's quarry in Jaecob and tries to move around Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It holds off as Dieter goes to block it's path, however.  It looks up, curiously.  Small tentacles reach out towards the druid.  A small, circular mouth rimmed with tiny teeth is at the center where the tentacles connect with the baby dragon's face.  It coos, eerily.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter thinks hard. He beckons the fledgling to follow him toward the door. As he approaches he glances at one of the gems and gets an idea. He picks one up, bracing for the pain, and holds it up at arms length to Flayco. "Do you know what this is baby?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby cocks its head to the side again, staring at the pretty pink-purple gem.  It's beating too, although soundlessly.  It flashes slightly, catching the baby's beady eyes.  The dragon lets out a coo that turns into a shrill shriek that turns into a hyena-type click/laughing.  It turns its head to look back and Jaecob, then turns back to the crystal.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thoughts intrude again, but not as intensely as before.  A small breeze comes from the other room, catching Dieter's clothes and rustling them innocently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tosses the crystal through the crack in the door trying to lure Flayco out and away from Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crystal <i>plinks</i> through the crack and into the other room, landing lightly on the floor.  Flayco meanders over to the door, taking another look back at Jaecob, longingly.  As the dragon peeks into the room, it rears, then starts backing away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What is it Flayco?”, Dieter sidles over and fingers his ring going invisible and peeking through the crack.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter peeks into the room.  It is pitch black everywhere but a little patch of pink-purple glow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to slooooooowly close the stone doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a peek back to make sure his new...whatever it is...is not eating Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door doesn't move at all.  The dragon baby is still shaking it's head, but when it stops, it's searching for food.  Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid’s mind is doing circles. He comes back over to Jaecob and shakes him a bit. “Jaecob! Jaecob! Wake up! It’s Dieter! Your mind is here in this world!........I’ve got ale!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There needs to be a magical cure to take him out of this state.  The baby dragon's tentacles starts meandering over Jaecob's feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here! Eat this!”, Dieter exasperatedly throws one last chunk of snake meat that he had somehow missed earlier when feeding Shelli. “Just stay clear of this man!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The meat hits the animal straight in the face.  It backs away, frightened...   (Animal handling check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It backs away, frightened, it's feelings hurt.  It comes over to Dieter after a few moments, trying to make amends.  The tentacles strain to find Dieter's hand for comfort.  An errant one stretches for Jaecob.</p></div>
