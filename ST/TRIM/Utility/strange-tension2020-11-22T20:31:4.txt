As soon as the though ends, a silvery string of liquid comes from the pool and starts to cover the entity.  The substance starts at the feet, covers the entire body, then retreats the same way it came.  As it retreats, Dieter can now see the features of Frenchy clear on this man.  Frenchy looks around, smiles at Dieter, then sits by the tree, waiting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pool bubbles slightly and the silver string comes out again, this time creating a being purely from it's essence.  This one looks of Stenchy.  A third time this silver stream comes out, a third man - Quenchy.  The three look at each other, then look to Dieter, beaming.  (What would you like to do?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Where do you go when you go where do you go?”</p><p>“Three I see yet four there may be. I wonder where the last of thee could be since only three i see.”</p><p>“Where does she go when she goes where does she go?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>His form breaks into fractured shifts of shape, sounds pouring out at odd angles. He settles on a nine-headed serpent that begins to reach out to every face  and the spaces on either side as well. They begin to entangle the forms, all becoming silver beams of light, flowing around through the pool and back again.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The image shifts, flips upside down and it becomes a dungeon.  The sound of someone speaking a strange yet familiar language can be hear in the distance, echoing off of the stone walls.  In the cell sits four people, three of whom Dieter knows very well.  The fourth is a newcomer he vaguely registers as...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The image flips again, shifts, Dieter is looking into a mirror, eyes wide, unfocused.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Maouelue...needs...”</p><p></p><p><i>He falls unconscious.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p><i>Naked, Dieter lies shivering in the detritus. Maouelue picks him up and carries him over to the forge to warm up. He brings the mage over and lays him out on the anvil altar.</i></p><p></p><p>“Time to wake up.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He reaches down into Dieter’s pack which he has brought near. His hand roots around for a moment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls out a swirling black dagger and drags the tip lightly over the bound mage’s forehead.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Time now for an answer to all the riddles...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Care to tell me what this is all about before your brain is wearing this?”</p><p><i>He digs the dagger in a bit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage comes to with a sputter and blinking eyes.  "Buh... whu..."  He sees the dagger.  Then he sees the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah..  m...  I... I don't...  I've never seen that blade befoAAAA!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, the rat?  Yes, yes, yes, the rat.  It's...  AH...  It's my birthright.  I am a wererat, too.  My purpose is to collect the dead and turn them.  We're creating an armyaAAAAHHH!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Where....with an H?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, no, no.  I'm a lycanthrope.  I can turn into a rat or hybrid, now at will, I've had it so long.  My whole family has ever been wererats.  If you want, I can show you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes I mean where?!? Where is the army...</p><p>and Runemark....</p><p>what of...it.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He starts shaking his head, "No, I can't tell you about him.  I can't.  But I can tell you where he is.  I can lead you to the army.  Just, please...  Take the dagger away!  My soul... my soul!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p><p>“But...you’ve never seen this before...”</p><p><i>He gestures to the dagger and cocks his head.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nnn, no.  Never."  He shakes his head emphatically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tell me, why should I let live one who raises the dead for his own sick purposes?”</p></div>
