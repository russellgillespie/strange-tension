strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Bat...  (deep breath)...  Bat-hamut scans the area.  He receives and relates info to Mao about the cavern.  No constructs, there are the W and E exits, which you've already been to.  There are also a small exit to the NE and SE.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He doesn't get a hit on anything live in the cavern.  (Want him to travel down a tunnel?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat continues down the SE tunnel.  Through twists and turns Maouelue gets the sense that the tunnel travels for quite a ways.  There are a few humanoids down this tunnel, they might be on a patrol of some kind.  (Would the bat know what they are?)  Suddenly, the telepathic link fades then is cut off, leaving Maouelue bereft of knowledge of the tunnel's end.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue waits a few minutes for the link to reconnect.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume follows, painfully.  The party goes twenty more yards and the link comes back to Mouelue.  The bat is hanging upside down outside of an entrance to a cave opening.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, no.  Gotta take the good with the bad, eh?"  He takes a swig from a flask, but other than that, he's following behind dutifully.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter walks down the SE passage.  About forty feet or so down, Dieter sees a goblin covered in dirt and feces.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He stops to consider the goblin a moment and listen.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It chitters away to other goblins.  Dieter can't see the others but he can hear them.  They're really loud.  And really disgusting.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries to pick out how many individuals he can hear.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks at the bat meaningfully as he does so.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are about six goblins that he can pick out.  There might be more beyond, but the immediate area has six.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue directs the bat to try and pull just the first goblin's attention while Dieter lines up an invisible sneak attack with his boomerang.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stands a bit back from the entryway while sending Frumious up to line up a ranged strike as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, gets into position.  The bat flits back to the goblins by Dieter.  It flies through the goblins, trying to distract it.  (Dex save for the bat, attack roll with advantage for Dieter.)</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat <i>poofs</i> as the goblin by Dieter swipes at him.  As it disappears, the goblin hears a <i>clunk</i> of wood hitting the wall of the tunnel right by it's head.  It looks around...</p></div>
