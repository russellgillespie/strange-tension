<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks over the body of the snake.  It's pretty hideous.  He's a constrictor snake, about 12 feet long.  Good meat for the taking, the hide is very valuable if tanned and treated correctly.  It wasn't poisonous, and even though it could speak and had smallish appendages that could have been called arms, it did not use weapons.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The two heroes, a bit shaken by their previous run in, have a bit of a restless time getting to sleep.  The majority of the night is peaceful.  There comes a time, right when the moon is just past the midpoint of its apex, when both men have the same dream...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>The darkness opens onto an entrance.  Runes are etched, but these are not the ones you're searching for.  There are many hazards here, many ways to die.  You enter and pass rooms, pass through hallways untouched by human eyes for generations.  You come upon a large hall, filled with statues holding up the ceiling.  These enormous statues depict lizardfolk in battle.  Victorious over their foes.  A strange feeling comes over you as you turn to see more lizardfolk around you, but these are not statues.  These are snake-people...  Snakes with humanoid features.  Arms on some, legs on others.  All with scales or some semblance of leathery hide.  They take you and tie you to the dias at the end of the big hall.  They pierce your side, let the blood run down the dias into a pool.  Whispery footsteps can be heard, a path is made by the crowd to let</i> him <i>in.  You catch a blurred glimpse of the smiling face as you succumb to your injuries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two only wake that once during the night.</p></div>
