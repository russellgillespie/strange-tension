strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks into the eyes of the woman.  Blood stains her thin shift.  Her smile beckons him.  Just before their lips meet, Dieter pulls away, pulling the dagger from the woman's body.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She shifts her legs off of the dais.  "Is something wrong, Master?"  She frowns at you.  Coquettishly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Show me your mind.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head, questioningly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“When you read this, what do you see?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He holds up the parchment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head the other way, looks into Dieter's eyes.  "What do you want me to see, Master?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash’s t the mage, they are black and red.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage’s eye glances quickly at the dagger, then back to the lady.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reels a moment, then looks down at his hand. He is suddenly sickened, and pulls the dagger out, staring dumbstruck at the blade.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman looks at the Dragon Mage, peers at him as if noticing him for the first time.  Doe eyes bat at the man, then back to Dieter.  "I'm alive.  Thanks to Master."  She gets up.  She's rail thin, her hair is waist length and jet black.  It somehow conflicts heavily with her extremely pale skin.  Aside from the dread you both feel, you can't help but think she's one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Looking intently at Dieter, she says, "Whatever Master wants, I will do."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks down, then at Dieter.  Her laugh is a girl's laugh, innocent.  "I can't lift that, Master.  It's too heavy for me.  Also, it is attached to the floor."  She approaches Dieter, slowly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Except what I want.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I can only do what I can do.  I can do many other things..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Show me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She approaches closer to Dieter, smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She reaches out to kiss Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stops.  Looks at Dieter, pouting petulantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You're no fun."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is caught between torment rage seduction and longing. His eyes flash color after color.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She whips her head to the mage.  "You can certainly try.  Wouldn't it be much more fun to just...  give in?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She raises her eyes, feigning being impressed.  "Lord of dragons, eh?  I've met many lords.  Not one could ever stave off my...  personality for very long."  She smiles coyly at you.  "It seems we are at a crossroads, gentlemen.  How should we proceed?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Stave off...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Stave off!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes the end of the staff of baobab and thrusts it into the open wounds in her chest!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The staff goes completely through the woman.  She looks down at it, nonplussed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Master is mad," she pouts.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He stares, amazed, for a moment then pulls the staff back out. He turns to the entry way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He goes to the left and stands at the edge of the plates.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, Master."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Walk across this room.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head at Dieter.  Then smiles widely at him.  "As you wish."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She steps lightly on the trapped floor.  Midway over the tiles, she turns to look back at Dieter.  "Care to join me, Master?"  She walks backward to the across the rest of the tiles, staring at Dieter the entire way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leads her back East and around to their construction near the lava.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue follows at a distance watching the scene unfold.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She follows you, tiptoeing across the tiles again.  The three of you approach the lava room.  Dieter immediately senses something is off.  Frume is not at his post.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note, but does not falter. He leads her around to the left of the lava and to the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go in here.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Master wants me to go... into the pit?"  She smiles.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. Take this. Dig me a staircase from the pit up to the right.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands her a shovel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Meanwhile Maouelue does take note of Frume’s absence and begins lightly scanning for clues.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman takes the shovel, in both hands.  She walks past the Dieter to the edge of the pit.  Approaching it backwards, staring at Dieter, she stops at the very edge facing away from it.  She cocks her head again, looking deeply into Dieter's eyes.  "We could have had so much fun."  She falls backwards into the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks the lava room, no signs of struggle.  He checks the garden vault.  Some bars of platinum are missing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He chuckles to himself.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Poor soul. He deserves whatever he made off with. This mission took more than he could afford.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He whispers a few words of prayer.</i></p></div>
