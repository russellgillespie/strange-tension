strange-tension"Well, I've had enough fun for one night, lads.  Name's Sy, I run the Broken Skull Ranch north side of town.  You need any help with these'ns or anything else, come on out and see us.  Else I'll see you in town." He dons his hat, tips it, and starts ambling northwards with a few other farmers and ranch-hands.
*Dieter and Maouelue begin to drag the Hog-tied man across town to Culver’s and ask Douglas to keep watch for Frenchy and the cart.*
They all let up a holler and wave goodbye as they all start ambling back to their homes.  The night is crisply cold.



Douglas is passed out from exhaustion just outside the tavern door, slumped in the dust.
Dieter and Maouelue, without really speaking to each other, get a funny feeling that something at the end of the fight was off...  Nothing specific, but you both know that something was off.
*Maouelue helps Dieter get the man across the threshold and then without a word hastens off back toward the Inn.*
*As he departs he can hear the beginnings of a fierce interrogation, Dieter’s voice resonating with a beast-like character.*
Maouelue nears the Sleeping Sheep.  The commotion has died down, the Pig's doors are wide open, the barkeep cleaning up inside.
*As Maouelue approaches the Tavern he looks for Douglas and Frenchy.*
The wizard looks for his other two companions.  Douglas is still passed out in the dirt in front of the tavern.  Frenchy is just starting to come out of the inn with the minecart, still laden with riches.

As you get closer, you can see Douglas, passed out, slumped against the side of the tavern.  The hog-tied man is nowhere in sight.
*Maouelue attempts to wake Douglas and bring him into the tavern. He sees Frenchy out of the corner of his eye and gestures for him to follow.*
Douglas slumps over further, a dark, wet red patch spreading over the bottom part of his dark tunic.
*Maouelue's head drops as he lets out a low moan. Fearing what he will find, he lays the man down and inspects the man's apparent wound.*

There's not much Maouelue can tell, he can't really get at the wound properly without taking off Douglas's tunic.  Moving him in this condition might be difficult and problematic.  You can tell, however, that his breathing is very shallow.
*He's panicking a bit now. He tells Frenchy to keep Douglas stable, then runs headlong into the tavern.*
*He looks around for anyone who might help.*

Frenchy does the best he can to staunch the bleeding, but there's no way for him to know if he's helping or hurting.  The wizard looks around, sees the barkeep sweeping inside.

He licks his lips and looks at you.  "Look at this place, will you?  I try to run a clean and honorable establishment, and you folks breeze into town, make havoc, and are carried out as heroes.  Leaving *me* to clean up the mess.  Just like always.  Adventurers.  Bah!"

He takes a beat, looks at the distress in Maouelue's face, and says, "Probably nothing a bandage and a good night's sleep won't fix.  But if you must, there is a priest of Ilmater at the parsonage down the way." (He points Northeast of town.)
*Maouelue storms out of the bar, losing control a bit, he works with Frenchy to load Douglas into the cart as gently as possible. They make as much haste as they can while trying to keep the cart steady and head off toward the parsonage.*
As you travel down the road, nearing the dead of night, the events of the day seem to be getting to you.  You're feeling very tired and in need of sleep...
The three travelers make their way to a run-down shack at the edge of town.  Nothing denotes it as a shrine, no symbols or totems decry it's patron.  A small woman sits out front, legs dangling off of a bench.  Her head is bowed, her hands clasped in her lap, fingers moving slightly over a simple metal item.  She is clothed in simple brown robes, with only a sash to designate her as an acolyte of Ilmater, the patron diety of suffering and sacrifice.
*Maouelue, staggering with exhaustion, shoves the cart a few feet away from the woman.*
Without a word, the woman jumps down from the bench and comes to you.  Her smile is warm, her mere presence is soothing to you, calming you instantly.  She touches Maoulue on the arm, and a warmth spreads from her touch all the way through his body, bringing clarity and peace to the overwhelmed wizard.
*Maouelue lets out a large breath he didn't realize he was holding.*
Silently she turns to the cart.  She peers in and her countenance changes to that of pity.  It's as if this hurt man, his pain, is causing her pain.  She reaches down to touch Douglas, her hands starting to stain red from his blood.
A yellow-gold glow starts emanating from her hands.  Seconds later, Douglas gasps, his breathing regulates, yet he does not come fully awake.   The glow recedes and she turns back to Maouelue.
"He's very weak.  We have no full bedding here, but there are bedrolls inside.  Would you like him to stay here so I can look after him?"  He voice is soft, musical, and... sad.  Yet her smile has not faded an inch, even when she looked on Douglas with pity.
