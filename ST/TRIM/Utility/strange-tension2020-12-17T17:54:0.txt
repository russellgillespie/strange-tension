strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Frume cocks his head at the barrier fire.  "Um..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We should go.  Probably now, aye?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both watch as the fire careens down the side of the barrier.  There's probably not much time until there is an explosion!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Quickly now!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads on and pleadingly looks at the snail to follow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail nuzzles you, searching for more food, while at the same time moving out of the room for fear of the fire.  The room beyond the former grain-bag wall is covered in straw, or maybe what remains of an old rug.  There is a lazy brazier in the corner, not doing much to give out heat or warmth.  Standard wooden doors are to the W and S.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail sails over the bags without any issue, surprising Frume!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks on admiringly at the snail and bequeathes his two Baobab Berries as a gesture of bonding.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Immediately you see color return to the snails greyish flesh.  It turns an amber color, blood can be seen coursing through it's vessels below the skin.  The shell regains more luster, too, and a dim light, getting brighter by the second, starts emanating from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks both doors, opening them quickly and surveying the rooms beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The W door opens to another corridor, roughly 35ft long.  It ends in stone double doors to the S, while a wooden door on the W side looks slightly ajar.  The S door opens to another storage room, various sundry items and foodstuff abound.  More of the pork jerky and cheese can be found here, along with eggs, herbs, and a strange box with what looks to be a stylized fish on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hey Shelli, you still hungry girl?” He proffers the inventory to his new pet, then inspects one of the fish boxes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The box is very well sealed, and a very familiar, fishy aroma greets Dieter when he opens it.  A waxed cloth encloses some of the finest black caviar Dieter has ever seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, this might trade for a fair penny, if we ever get the chance...” He stows the caviar then eats a few hunks of cheese, forgoing the pork and looking for some mint to settle his stomach.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Not only do you find some hanging peppermint and spearmint, you also find basil, oregano, and a plethora of fancier herbs for cooking and herbalism.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh these will make the road life much more bearable.” He stows a healthy amount then beckons for the duo to follow him down to the stone doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume finds a pack and starts stuffing food in, particularly the cheese and pork.  He follows with a piece of jerky hanging out of his mouth.  He tosses a very moldy cheese wheel towards Shelli, who snatches it out of the air.  Her shell shimmers gratefully.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is snarling coming from behind the stone doors.  Ripping and tearing of something as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, there is a MASSIVE <b><i>BOOM</i></b>!  Stone, grain, dust, and other debris rockets out from the door at the N end of the hall, smashing into the wall opposite the door.  An inhuman <i>screech</i> is heard from the former room as flames pour out of the former doorway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume turn to look as a charred abomination clambers out through the newly made hole in the wall.  It walks like a crab or scorpion, smaller appendages in the front, getting bigger the farther up the body they go.  Six appendages in all.  They seem to be an amalgamation of leg and arm bones, ending in a perverse mashup of feet, hands, and claws.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The body, despite being charred, is the torso of a human, but everything is stitched together backwards.  The shoulders and head are at an angle as to let the thing crawl, but still be able to look around at its environment.  Like a scorpion mixed with a centaur, the thing rears up on its hind legs when it sees you and the snail.  To more appendages flick out from it's back, a mixture between a tentacle and a scorpions stinging tail.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sharpen your shell Shelli, we’re in for a fight!”</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume tries to open the double doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He gets the doors slightly ajar...  And slams them shut.</p></div>
