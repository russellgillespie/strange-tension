<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is being very careful to stay back from the woman.  Maouelue searches the area, moving his hands over the bas reliefs on the walls.  He lingers a few extra moments on the triad as the centerpiece of the pictures.  The room seems a shrine of sorts.  Or perhaps, something more?  He finds no secret spaces, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves out of the room and back north to look west across the tile room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A silver Ouroboros is in the center of this room.  With his darkvision, Maouelue can also see scratch marks on the area of the base where the drawer would be.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>i’m looking back across the raised/pressure plates</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The figure in the adjacent room catches his eye and he inspects it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is exactly like the bronze and gold ones you've previously seen.  You can assume it has the same drawer in the onyx base.  Where as the bronze had a key, this one does not.  Words are inscribed on the base this time.  <i>I am The Great World Serpent. I begin where I end and end where I begin.  Name me.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The drawer starts to open, then gets stuck on something.  (Strength check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The drawer comes out a little more.  Maouelue can see inside.  A piece of parchment lays at the bottom, and colored jewels sparkle atop it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He is compelled beyond restraint and attempts to secure them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It opens further.  If you're careful you could probably get the contents out.  (Sleight of hand check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gauntlet is preventing Maouelue's hand from getting in.  A finger brushes against one of the jewels.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Gah...Dieter!!! come over here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The druid hears the yell and follows</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He scoffs a little at the gauntlets.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is able to remove the two items from the drawer.  A jeweled encrusted dagger with a curved blade is the first item.  When unsheathed, it is dull black.  It almost looks wet.  The page is written in a serpentine language.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger is coated in the blood of a higher demon from the Nine Hells.  It cannot be wiped off, nor can the dagger be destroyed unless it is consumed in the fires of the Nine Hells.  If this blade kills anything with a soul, that soul is bound to the blade.  Each soul collected gives it the ability to kill an entity of a higher plane, god or demon alike.  This would also relate to the sarrukh, who were the original serpentine race, the progenitors of all serpentine peoples.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Until...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter plunges the knife down, his hand grazes the woman's skin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes open and she looks down at the two wounds in her chest.  Blood starts pooling at the man's hands.  Black blood oozes from the cut Maouelue made, while there is a sizzling sound of frying coming from the site of the black dagger.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"M...  Master?"  She calls to Dieter.  "Why?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She is pale, a ghostly white.  You'd never noticed it before, but you suppose she's looked like that from the beginning.  The color of bleached bone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her hands reach out to caress Dieter's face, lovingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Destiny.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles.  "I could be."</p></div>
