<div class="character-0"><p>“Sleeeeep.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sleeeeep.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume puts his hand over the thugs mouth and stabs.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume catches the man, staring into his glassy eyes, and moves him into the cell with the chests.  Then, backing out quickly, shuts the doors and locks the dead man in.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter goes to quickly retrieve the playing card then searches the thief’s body for valuables.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><s>The guy has a couple coppers on him and a rusty knife.</s></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The duo head further west down the hall and Dieter takes the lead going invisible again.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Not a worry, just saw it.)</p><p>The guy had one gold, five silver, and a note of writ, mentioning a ransom for the escaped druid, Dieter Deleter.  The seal of the Runemark is marked in wax at the bottom of the parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s teeth look a bit like fangs as he snarls at the ransom note. He gives the thief’s corpse a swift kick before leading Frume down the hall. He takes the lead an invisibly scouts out the upcoming turns, listening for any significant movement or sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair move W, throwing the door at the end wide.  It was their former cell, the remains of what they could only assume is Culver is strewn about the room.  There is now a hole in the wall where the two escaped from.  The room is covered in blood, but something else seems off, too.  (Investigation check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room starts to spin as the sight of all that blood (and lack of flesh) begins to disgust Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Suppressing a retch, the disoriented Druid turns and beckons onward.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We need to get out of this hell trap. I need air. Did they say this was a castle? perhaps we can find a parapet and repel. Anything to get out of here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Les go back to the main room.  Thought I saw some doors in there.  There might be something across from that chest cell, too.  See about those areas first, I'll be on the lookout for any ladders up."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Upon further investigation, across from the chest cell, a smaller room had the look of just a standard cell.  Hidden in the shadows, a decrepit door stands.  The original room (with the tables and card game) has a door to the S, where you had heard the voices coming from.  (Investigation check for more!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a tapestry on the E wall, looks strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are muffled sounds coming from under the hatch, too.  They're fading, though.  Turning to mourning wails.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter expresses his newfound love of tapestries by lovingly investigating this one as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Looks like a nice work.  Mutli-hued.  Can't really make out the design on it.  It's really bulky, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter continues down the hall to meet Frume and look for additional ways of passage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a door across from the cell with the chests in it, a door in the S wall of the trap door room.  (Retconned the direction of that one because of the new map!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They check the door across from the cell, listening first for sounds behind it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is impressed by the door's construction, while Dieter listens intently.  No sounds are coming from the other side.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to open the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens to a dark room.  Sparse cobwebs linger in the corners, moldy and tattered hempen bags are scattered on the floor, mostly congregating in the corners.  There is another wooden door on the W side of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter casts a quick glance at the bags to determine what they might be containing, but mostly keeps moving forward.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a quick glance, there's nothing there.  Rotted grains, decrepit cloth.  The next door is slightly ajar.  It opens into a strange storage room.  It's narrow and ends in bags of grain piled up to the ceiling.  There is light coming through several open places throughout the makeshift wall, leading you both to believe there is something beyond it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They begin baling the bags over to block up the door they just came in as they try to reveal what’s behind.</p></div>
