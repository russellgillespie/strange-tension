<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods and exits a south door, leaving it open.  There are enough ingredients to make about 2d10 standard potions of healing, or 2d4 superior potions of healing.  (You would need an herbalism kit to prepare potions.  A proficiency in it will let you add your proficiency to the roll to make anything.  Expertise will get you advantage on top of that.)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he works the bench, he fiddles with a bit of the shamrock and mistletoe, grinding them into a pulp and rubbing down the sides of the workspace, sending a greenish yellow glow throughout the wood. He hums a reel as he works.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>While resting, the group starts to relax.  However, this is a bad place to relax.  There is a chittering coming from the hallway.  Maouelue rushes to the doorway.  Nothing is there.</p></div>
