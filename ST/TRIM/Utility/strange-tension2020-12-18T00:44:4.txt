<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Behind him, a few paces back, is a skeleton crew.  Quite literally.  A room full of skeletons can be seen beyond the man.  At his heels, a wight stalks.  The zombie-looking man has long, stringy hair.  Studded leather armor glistens in the hazy light of the flail snails shimmery shell.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He doesn't see Dieter finishing with the barrel.  He only has eyes for the room on the W wall.  He runs to it, nearly knocking over the barrels as he does so.  He almost knocks over the snail, too, trying to force his way in.  "Out of my way, you filthy, slimy creature."  His voice is nasal, and heavily affected by high-born speech.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He races into the room and disappears from Dieter's view.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>And he is stunned, shaking his head, trying to rid his vision of the spots.  The snail lets out a victorious cry!</p></div>
