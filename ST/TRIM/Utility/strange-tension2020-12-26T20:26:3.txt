strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter walks slowly into the room he rubs at an itch on one of his temples. He takes a keen look at the brazier down to his left and makes a note to inspect the tents thoroughly afterward.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter scans a couple braziers close to him.  They seem to have oddly shapes crystals in them, again giving off light.  The tents have seen better days, although, that being said, they have more than likely been standing and decaying for quite some time.  Could be years to decades, it's hard to say.  The animal hide on them was cured, but they are still worn and threadbare.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter looks in a couple tents, he can see into one and traces of dried blood can be viewed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks goes about all of the tents looking inside each to see if they are empty and/or clean.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns his head as he passes back by the door and beckons Shelli to join.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli lets out a <i>"Mwaaap"</i> and squeezes through the doorway.  As the investiagtion continues, the tents look either picked over or very sparse.  There are remnants of fires here and there.  The one with the blood has a corner covered in it, splashing up on the leathers.  Nothing else can be discerned from the tents, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Jaecob, I must admit, my spirit and body are weary. The encounter with your father’s shade on top of all that led to this imprisonment has taken its toll. Pray, help me gather these crystals to put out the lights and let us take rest in these tents. Not the Pig and Falcon by a long shot, but better than being completely exposed as well. Shelli, we’ll rotate our guard and make sure you can rest too, poor thing.” He strokes a slimy stalk affectionately.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look like crystals to you, nothing more than that.  You pile them up in the tent, check and shut the doors to the best of your ability, and settle yourselves for a long rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men wake up to voices.  Inside their heads.  Not painful.  Not speaking to them, either.  </p><p><i>"...Have to make sure he doesn't wake, EVER..."</i></p><p><i>"Did you see where they went?..."</i></p><p><i>"... Should be ready by now...."</i></p><p><i>"...If this guys bosses me around one more time..."</i></p><p><i>"Brains...  brains...  BRAINS..."</i></p><p><i>"Keep them out.  Must keep them out!"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All of the words swirl together.  It doesn't even sound like many people, but the words ram into Jaecob and Dieter's minds without pause.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli cocks her head at the two men.  Jaecob puts his hands to his ears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The glowing crystals sparkle in the darkness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter raises himself slowly and begins to peer about the tent and then slowly outside the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tents are clear, as they were yesterday.  There is nothing that presents itself to either Dieter or Jaecob, but something does catch Muhlen's attention. He approaches the altar at the top of the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What is it Jaecob?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm not sure.  Looks expensive, though!"</p><p>As he slowly climbs the gradual steps, he points to a golden alms box underneath the altar table.  At opposite ends of the altar, two skulls of some lizard-like creature stare down at Jaecob as he climbs.  In the center of the table is an egg-shaped object atop a short pedestal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter climbs the steps and stands next to Jaecob. He peers at the object curiously, taking it in against all he has seen with the tapestries, reliefs, and of course his recent conversation with the spirit Lord.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what the iconography is meant for, but it is a brilliantly wrought piece.  Solid gold, with very intricate designs.  There is a lock on the front, looks like it would open like a typical chest.  (Perception for more of the area or investigation for traps/locks.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's locked but otherwise looks fine to Dieter!  (Sleight of hand for lockpicking, perception check for other things, or investigation if you want anything specific!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is wary about the hidden potentials of the strange room and altar. He moves his body in a circular motion sending out radiating sparkles as he speakers the incantation searching for traces of magic here.</p></div>
