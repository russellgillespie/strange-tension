strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>At this Maouleue's curiosity is peaked and his confusion at Bella's reaction is temporarily swept aside.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The captain begins, "The recoveries of Erifias and Cruiver have been top notch.  They specifically requested to be on the next mission with you.  I have assigned them to your detail, lord wizard.  If that is amenable to ye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Have they indeed! That is most welcome news. I would be honored to fight beside them once more."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And what of you Otirnis and Cierean? What are your intentions?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Erifias steps forward and says, "My whole team is ready to fight, lord wizard.  They are all in agreement."  Four faces beam at the group around the table.  Maouelue gets the feeling that the highest of the guard is being picked for this mission, and this team very much wants to be considered in that rank.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out his hands to the center of the group. "Take my hands all of you. May the light and life of the lord guide us."</p><p></p><p>He lowers his head and begins to channel his spirit of guidance through the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you all, from the whole of my heart. Never shall I forget this day."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us all now make our final preparations ere we head out to the front!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone is slightly taken aback, but very enthusiastic as they all grasp hands, then glow with the light of Maouelue's magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>At this Maouelue turns and walks tentatively toward the direction of Bellatrix's flight."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several of the members of the Queen's guard and the captain continue strategizing, bent over the map as you met them.  The members of the Court gracefully make their way out, as well.  Daran stays behind to look over the battle plans.</p><p></p><p>Just outside the throne room, on the steps leading to upper chambers of the castle, Benna and Bellatrix sit, Bella's head in her sister's lap.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He stops on the spot, unsure whether he should continue; whether he should be so forward as to interrupt this private moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is weeping softly, but she's not hysterical anymore.  Benna is just lightly combing her hands through her sister's hair.  Her eyes are closed.   Mao is not quite sure this is a private moment, but it is a quiet one.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage stands there a moment longer before saying, "Forgive my intrusion, but I wanted to check on you Bella. I apologize if my actions were improper in any way. I did not intend to offend."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes stay closed, but she speaks in a soft, quivering voice.  "No, you did nothing wrong.  But, I couldn't...  I can't tell everyone in there..."  Her hand shoots out to hold Maouelue's.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue is surprised at this, but stands firm and grips her hand in return.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It is such a long story, how I came to be...  like I am.  But after feeling the surge of evil before, at the battle with the giants...  I... I..."  She chokes up, and sputters, trying to get words out.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will be as death to you if I go on this mission."  She looks Mao straight in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks back deeply, searching the pupils of her eyes, perhaps for the darkness deep within that she mentions.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't quite see into the depths, but there is darkness there.  And a faint light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I see. Then it shall be so. Please, take rest here in the care of the eladrin. Perhaps you will find more out more than we, if you find yourself up to the task. Keep your eyes and ears open and read deeply. Your knowledge and Benna’s wisdom may be more important than all the braun that has been put forward here. <i>I believe in you.</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The witch looks into the wizards eyes as well, both coming to some decision of their own.  Finally, she smiles and squeezes Mao's hand again, then lets go.  "We will learn as much as we can while we are here, right Benna?"  She turns to her sister, then back to Maouelue.  "Please be safe.  And come back to us.  To me."  She looks down for a moment, then shyly back up.  Her smile wavers.  Then, with arms linked, the sisters retreat up the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue watches their retreat back up the stairs until they are out of sight. He lingers a moment on the spot, Bella’s final words ringing in his head...</p><p></p><p><i>To me.</i></p></div>
