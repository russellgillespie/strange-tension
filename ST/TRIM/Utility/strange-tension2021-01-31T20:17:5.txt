"You are special, Maouelue.  You and your group.  Far be it for me to hold your presence or circumstances against you.  In fact, the way I see it, if you hadn't appeared when you did, we might not have made it back to Aztrazalian at all.  There were too many to face for our group, between the fomorians and the goblin horde.  There is no need for sorrow or grief towards me or my unit, lord wizard.  We stand behind you.  And will continue to fight by your side, should you still find it fitting."  She hops on a horse tethered to the post outside the inn, offers the other four to the party and says, "Follow me, please."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She then heels her horse W towards the center of the island.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group moves quickly through the somewhat empty streets.  Giving a wide berth to the horse riders, the elves and eladrin gawk at the procession.  Through the town, through the crystal gates, then into the courtyard proper, everyone is relieved of their mounts and walked into the palace.  Maouelue notices there are several guards escorting them now, where as before it was quite a bit lighter coverage.  Bellatrix stands besides the wizard, offering her support in proximity.  Daran and the old woman take up  the rear, Benna now quiet with no hint at mirth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The escort brings them to the throne room where, as before, the three chairs are filled by their liege lords.  The Queen looks outwardly calm, but sits straighter in her chair as she sees the procession brought forward.  King Oberon looks concerned, while Queen Tiandra has a look of puzzlement on her face.  She says, "What are they doing back here, guards?  I thought the Court made it clear that they were no longer welcome here."</p><p></p><p>"Be at peace, sister.  The guards were instructed to bring them if there was a parlay to be had.  I assume that is why you are here again, goodsir Mage?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I must admit, I was surprised to be offered a second chance after my previous...outburst. I know not what overcame me, but i ask not for forgiveness, only the opportunity to repent. For this chance, I am most grateful. There is much confusion in my heart, but my mind is set firmly on aiding your cause and rescuing my friend. </p><p></p><p>These past days I have let my ego grow wild to the detriment of others. No longer shall this be the case. I take the knee once more.”</p><p></p><p>Lumao genuflects again, this time with no sense of grandeur.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The others follow suit, mimicking their leader.  </p><p>"Please, rise, sir Mage.  What is done is done, and what was said," she gives Maouelue a knowing stare, "was said.  Take to heart what you can accept, leave the rest as you will.  It is my understanding, since you are here, that you all still wish to still take part in ridding our lands of the scourge of the Queen of Air and Darkness's forces of evil?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It is thus, Majesty.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at all of the group in turn.  (Insight check, with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She's holding something back, but what it is, you're not sure.  Maybe her next statement...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She seems to come to a decision.  "There has been a new development.  There is a need for a small, rogue group to infiltrate the my dark sister's lair itself."  The King and Queen turn to look at her, confused.  "The dark crystal that has tormented her thus would be the objective.  She carries it with her at all times.  And she is surrounded by guards and all other manner of unseelie fiends.  This is not something I ask lightly, obviously.  However, it would mean the end to whatever has a hold on her.  It would also go a long way to proving your worth to the Court.  If this does not sound amenable to you our your party, the raid is still an option."  She sits placidly while waiting for a response.  As for the other seelie in the room, every mouth is agape.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It shall be done.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 3 iterations, DC 20...</p><p>1d20 (14) + 2 = </p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (7) + 2 = </p><p>0 successes, 28 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna starts giggling under her breath again.  Daran sighs.  Bellatrix takes a sharp intake of breath.  But no one says anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Very well.  You will meet with Captain Jelentrianna in the armory in four hours time.  She will go over the objectives.  Bring me back the black crystal and my sister, both preferably unharmed.  Anything else is ancillary and up to your discretion.  If you wish, we can give you an out if you are caught and do not wish to be tortured.  The Captain will see to your needs and the plans.  Good luck and may the gods bless you all, warriors of Astrazalian."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao bows silently and follows to the armory.</p></div>
