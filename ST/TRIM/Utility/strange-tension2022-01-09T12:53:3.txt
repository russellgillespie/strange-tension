strange-tensionShaking its head, trying to stave away the spell, it lashes out at the nearest target.


Dieter grunts and mutters, “Here goes nothing.” He pulls a red vial from his pack and rolls it back toward his friends. “Here, take this! Cover me!” and with that, he dashed right into the draw between the two Bhargests pulling out his totemic bladestaff and beginning to sing a song of a lad that is gone.

Jaecob, seeing his friend’s battle cry, raises his voice to the frenzy, “Oooooooooo-ooo-o-o-oooooooooo!” He comes flying in with blade drawn. He flicks his foot up at the potion on the ground grasping it with his left hand in stride then dashes for the injured Barghest.


“Grrraaaaaa!”

Two ferocious swings wildly miss their target, and now the rash man is in the thick of it. He digs deep for his second wind, hoping on hope to make it out of this alive.

Shelli, hearing the commotion, pops her head out of its shell and sees Jaecob has gone, she schultz over to the doorway and sees the dread melee unfolding.
“Baaaaaaaalk!!!” she cries, seeing Deiter in mortal combat with the two beasts.

“Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!!!” Screams Jaecob.
The snail, doing a double take a Jaecob’s errant strikes, slimes up to the first beast and lashes out with a tentacular flurry.

The slimy appendages merely slide of the writhing barghest’s matted fur leaving only a trail of ooze. 
“Bwaaaalk!!!” she screeches.
Completely confused, probably trying to grasp what creature is in front of it - is it a dragon?  An octopus?  A squidling?  What the hell is it?! - the barghest blinks and the fighting continues!
A sickening smile stretches wide across the whelp’s grotesque face as it licks its lips and lunges at the beast in front of him.

Flayco lurches to the side at the last minute as a threatening turn from the barghest makes him finch and miss.
Shell shocked by seeing an enormous creature enter the room, the barghest's mouth falls open...  and the fight continues!
“Everyone! Behind me!  Go! Now!”

Dieter calls on the fury of an East wind being sucked out to sea in the eye of a great storm, blasting back the barghests and clearing a path for his companions to the door. “We must run, while we can!”
Dieter runs to the door, throws it open, and sees a room filled with books and experiments, laboratory equipment and rows upon rows of items meant for magical use.  There is another door at the far end, next to a curved length of table with a variety of on-going experiments on it.

The door can be locked once everyone is inside, there are three deadbolts.
They all make a mad dash for the door taking advantage of the Barghests’ confusion. Flayco, Jaecob, and Dieter all make the space in a few leaps then they turn back to see Shelli slowly moping across the floor. 
“Come on girl!” Dieter cries.
Shelli dashes in reply. Never before had a snail been seen to slime so smoothly.
Jaecob looks between the beasts and Dieter and the sunlight, grimacing with resolve before running toward the door and then quickly quaffing the potion he had received from Deiter’s throw once he is safe behind the door.
Dashchleuurp.
The barghest, sensing something, takes off like a shot out of the downed drawbridge!
BA1 removed from combat.
Flayco makes a break for it, sending a covering loogie toward the remaining snarlbeast.

"Blarglemarglephaaaarg!!!" He shouts as the stream of misses continues, then dashes for the door in a ridiculous gait picking up his wings like a maids skirts as she walks through a muddy patch. Back and forth he waddles on two talons, eventually making it through the door.
Still trying to figure out what the hell Flayco is, the barghest stares, dumfounded.
Dieter now shifts the direction of the wind slightly pushing the barghest North toward the drawbridge while still holding out at the door for Shelli.
[Another save i believe]


Wind blows the coarse hair to a fro on the beast, but does not move him further.
“On Shelli!”
(Ha was just gonna do that 🙂  )
Jaecob begins milling about the room anxiously and looks over the various wares.

It's strange, all of the equipment here seem to be...  foreign.  Alien, actually, as some of the handles on these are meant for longer limbs, elongated fingers, and there are thin layers of...  slime all over everything.  A couple potion bottles are stoppered on a shelf above some bubbling beakers.  The potions colors are red, black, and orange.  On the far table, a map is unfurled and red marks are made all over it - both writing and glyphs.
He leaves the potion bottles for a moment heading over to the map to try and get some sort of orientation within this foul place. He turns and looks nervously back at the door as he does and gives Flayco a squish pat of appreciation at the effectiveness of his gross bile attack.
“Schloooop! Schleeeeooooppp!!!! Scchlooooooorf!” She grunts at the final breakstalk pace she reaches lurching for the door.
