strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Two separate tree trunks, 10ft in diameter, come flying through the forest from beyond the rise.  The two lead elves checking out the noise catch the full brunt force of the attack, while the leader and Daran are just able to move out of the way at the last minute.  Maouelue's group jumps into the brush at the side of the forest path, while the other elves dodge and try to recover their friends as best they can.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women are scraped up, and Daran immediately attends to their wounds.  The Eladrin revive their friends, who were knocked prone, one still looks completely out for the count.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunderous footfalls can be heard coming down the path toward the groups.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, thinking quickly, offers the net of invisibility to Daran for the Sisters.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman looks at the net oddly, then smiles wide.  She grabs it, tosses it around herself and Bellatrix, and the women disappear from sight.  Daran apprears taken aback for a moment, but then the thudding stops and he turns to see, 80 feet up the path...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Four massive, 15ft tall giants, grotesquely disfigured, emerge from the forest.  They see the scattered group and start chortling.  "Look, fellas," one says in a deep, lethargic drawl.  "We got ourselves some morsels."  The foursome start laughing and hoisting their clubs.  Slowly, they start advancing towards their prey.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Are we running?" he asks Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us kite them out. Surely us elves are fleeter of foot than these beasts! We’ll run them ragged!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“On second thought!...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The giants bowl into the wood, knocking down saplings and revving up.  Their stares seem to unnerve some of the other elves.  The leader and the one on the verge of being knocked out seem effected most.  Suddenly, boils start breaking out all of the two elves's bodies!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Groups cannot cast spells.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s mind whirls at all that has happened in what seems like the last minute. He half wonders if Daran’s proclamations about fey time are in action as they speak. He steadies himself, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. He breathes a cold stream onto it, watching it crystallize and grow, then calls to the icy winds of the north mountains, bringing down a heavy blast of snow!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tough bastards, eh?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran and Bellatrix look at Maouelue and nod.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix surveys the scene, it’s a fearsome sight, the four hulking giants leering and approaching, the fallen Eldarin...she doesn’t like to show this side of herself, but there is nothing else for it now. She steps up and begins to speak in a low guttural tongue. The words echo strangely off the fae woods as if they don’t belong here...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A dark circle forms just behind the the group of giants, a crimson marks scattered across the center. Black beams erupt up out of the runic circle as the shapes appear.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The blood witch returns none of the presumably gawking stares.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin turn their heads to the group, trying to see just who these people are!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She leads the group back about 30 feet from the giants, tugging at the awestruck Maouleue who seems to have forgotten his feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran makes a move to follow, then looks back at the struggling eladrin...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Bellatrix shuffles the group westward, she pulls out a decrepit looking eyeball. The same dark language leaves her lips in a trail of red mist. An inverted star wraps itself around the newt’s sphere and shoots out toward the eyes of the last giant in line.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran runs over to the passed out eladrin, fires at the closest giant, and asks the eladrin leader, "How can I help?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader shouts, "Cierean, take him away!  You, half elf.  Help us fight!!"</p><p>An eladrin grabs the prone elf and disappears.</p></div>
