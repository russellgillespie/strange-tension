<div class="character-1"><p>The snake is going to try and move Dieter down into the hole... (Either Dex or Strength save, whichever is better for you.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snake licks up the side of Dieter's face.  "I'll bring you along aaassss a ssssnacking..."</p><p>And he pushes Dieter into the hole.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard, worried about his friend, slams his potion and jumps down the hole.  Much to the surprise of the snake.  As he's falling, he realizes the hole is much deeper than he originally thought.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stands up and wiped the scut off of his face. With a scowl he reaches into his bag and pulls out his last potion of healing, bracing himself from what may come from the snake.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The snake sticks it's head to the mouth of the hole.  It opens it's maw, hissing, strands of saliva dripping down into the opening.  When suddenly...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A crossbow bolt catches the constrictor on the side of the head, it lets out another roar and turns it's head to the source.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It looks back and forth, trying to make a decision...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And jumps down the <i>other</i> hole in the street...</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's eyes are covered in what looks like cumulus clouds reflecting off of the ocean for a moment, when the swirling orange light from his blade whisks it away. He looks around for any ways these two holes might be connected before choosing whether to try and climb out of the hole.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter leads the way, searching for passages that connect.  After a couple rounds, there doesn't seem to be a direct connection yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They make their way back over to the hole they came from and call to Vam for a hand up.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam is peering down the hole, nods, and throws a rope ladder down.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group climbs up and asks Vam if he knows where the snake is.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter starts up the rope ladder.  About halfway up, he hears hissing coming from the tunnel...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He shines his sword light back down, preparing to drop and perform a downward thrusting attack if he sees what he thinks he will.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter holds on to the ladder lying in wait for the snake's reappearance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The constrictor dashes toward the waiting druid, his flaming sword lighting the darkness.  It snaps at the dangling human, but misses.  On his way past, the sword flashes and nicks the snake in the side.  Another roar, and the snake tries to scramble back.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tries to slow the giant serpent's retreat, his hands glowing white then sending out a frosty beam at the slithering form.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue forgets to hold on to the rope while channeling his ray and falls down after the snake.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's animal rage is beginning to wane. He summons the fleeting vapors of his strength and hurls himself at his retreating prey, flaming scimitar held high, ready to plunge in the snake's spine.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snake takes yet another massive hit from Dieter's sword.  It falters, not quite knowing what to do.  It sees the wizard off balance and the druid hanging on to the ladder, trying to make his way up...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And he attacks!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He attacks with his bite, sinking his fangs <i>deep</i> into his opponent's leg.  He stays there, swaying as Dieter hangs on to the rope ladder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue breathes deep, blowing frosty breath onto one of his triumvirate. He loads it into his sling and lets fly at the snake's left eye.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter drags himself over, standing above the snake with a limp bloodied gaze. He pulls his arm back and thrusts the flaming point right into the serpent's side.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>...but he slips at the last moment in his exhaustion.</i></p></div>
