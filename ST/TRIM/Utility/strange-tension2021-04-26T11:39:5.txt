strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's hand rests on the ice block for a beat, enough time for him to notice that it is slightly warmer than the rest of the room around him.  Suddenly, he is transported to a small, sunlight-strewn room reminiscent of a green-house.  A variety of plants adorn the room, and the colors range through the rainbow, showering the room in brilliance.  Directly in front of Maouelue, a small table holds a very unique plant.  It is potted and just starting to grow, and has a small purple bulb at it's top.  Two small barrels are next to it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins by inspecting the lot of plants around before honing in on the contents of the barrels and the plant in the place of honor. </p><p>“What m mysteries lie below this frozen fortress! I wonder if there are more writings in here?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard moves cautiously through the flowering plants, curious and calculating.  Multi-hued roses bloom, hydrangea, gardenia, hyacinth, iris, lily...  all full and exploding in color.  Quite a contrast from the slate blue-grey-white of the ice palace.  As he meanders and approaches the small table, the purple petal atop the newly-sprouted plant opens.  As it blooms, it shows that it has facial features.  The mouth opens to say, in a high, quiet voice, "Welcome traveler.  There are two barrels of magical sap next to my table.  Feed me and I shall grow."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue obliges.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He inspects the cask on the left first, checking for how the lid opens, pulling out his dagger to pry if needed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cask is sealed tightly, but Maouelue can take some time to look at it and pry off the lid.  Inside is a deep blue, viscous liquid.  Looking around, there is nothing to transfer the sap to the plant, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He also attempts to open the second one the same way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The second opens, the same blue liquid, just less of it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How do you take your feeding, ser plant?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That is up to you, saer mage," it says cryptically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes out his small knife and dips it into the container on the right, pulling up the viscous sap and proceeds to drop some, like so much honey, onto the soil around the plant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Slowly, drop by drop, Maouelue feeds the strange plant.  With each drop, the stalk reaches to higher, the purple petals grow a deeper hue.  Eventually, it looks fully developed, healthy and beaming.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, wizard."  Two seeds then sprout from under on of the leaves, and it continues, "One is for you, one is to plant.  Use them wisely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you, most gracious and well-spoken of flora. Pray tell me, would you like to join your cohort on the sides of this room? I could give your offspring a head start here in this most fertile of soils."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It bows to Maouelue, and raises its 'face' to his.  "Thank you, kind saer.  But I believe I would like to stretch my legs myself."  </p><p></p><p>The dirt starts shifting and Maouelue sees two root-legs come out and breech over the pot's edge.  They land on the table, and with a large, full-bodied stretch, the small plant takes a couple steps and hops down off the table to meander itself among its brethren.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Will these marvels never cease!" Maouelue jests to himself. He begins to plant the second seed and calls out to the plant, "If I may, what are you called, master plant?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although Maouelue is fairly knowledgeable about nature and even arcane-based flora and fauna, this one puzzles him.  He remembers reading, some time ago, about a species of sentient tree-folk, but the name and exact details of it escape him. </p><p></p><p>"Call me sapling, dear mage.  Once I mature past my smallest stage, I will know a proper name and my place in...  whiche'er world I shall be a part of.  For now...  I am just...  sapling."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Very well, sapling, I shall do so. Do you have a regular "gardener" in this place?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Prince comes every now and again, but he does not tend my family or I.  He is not allowed.  Only the seekers shall tend and reap the rewards...  or despoil us and be punished."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around for a moment, considering just how many "seekers" there might be. </p><p></p><p>"One more thing before I part...May I take some of this sap to nurture this seed, or am I to be left to my own for such a thing?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sapling turns to Maouelue and smiles.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first to ask.  Absolutely you may.  And may the Earth Mother bless you and the seed you shall plant."</p></div>
