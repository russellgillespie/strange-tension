strange-tensionFinally biting into the wizard, the creature's serrated teeth rip a hunk of flesh, and it travels down the thing's gullet.




These things are bloody, bruised, and oozing slime left and right.  They're getting frantic now, swinging their bodies left and right, trying to do any damage they can.


The thing starts to move back to it's hole in the wall.  (AOO for Dieter.)




The slavering creature crawl slowly to the paralyzed ape/man...



Ape (Dieter Deleter) removed from combat.
âœ… Dieter Deleter removed from all groups.
The creature is surprised again by the transforming beings in front of it.  It roars again, then looks for it's mate...
*The group begins to focus down the fleeing crawler*

The carrion crawler on the wall slides down a foot as it's hit.



The creature pulls itself slowly into it's lair, going completely out of sight.

*Maouelue drops his balls temporarily and takes his sword in both hands, briefly bringing it point up in front of his face, muttering a prayer to Bahamut.*
*He strides over, eyes locked on the crawler, furiously intent on laying it low. He thrusts with two hands!*

*He misses! Bahamut has forsaken him! Perhaps because he has not been particularly devout of late....or ever. Why the wizard chose this moment is anyone's guess.*
*He looks back longingly at his balls.*

*But then again, perhaps Bahamut heard this first prayer after all. Saving the wizard at least from the poisonous secretions of the cave crawler.*
It wraps it disgusting tentacles around the wizard, trying to grab him for a bite!

It grapples Maouelue with it's slimy tentacles, bringing the poor wizard closer to it's tooth-ridden maw.
*Frenchy throws caution to the wind and streaks toward the grappling beast, dropping his crossbow and pulling out his rapier and dagger. He lets out a battle cry. "Pour les enfaaaaaaaants!"


*Stenchy clambers over.* "Pour la patrie."

*Dieter gets in the mood.* "The day of of glory has arrived."
*He stows his boomerang and pulls out his bladestaff, grabs a few different leaves from his pouch and his staff glows...*

A tear escapes from one of the beady eyes.  Or it could have been poison goo.  Either way, the thing is a pile of mush as Dieter ends it.  The tentacle grabbing Maouelue slackens.  (Feel free to pile on the flavor!)
*Maouelue, keen not to miss out on the poetry adds,* "Let his blood become the soil."
*A rallying cry goes up from the citizens, they dance a django jig around the bloody, gooey corpse.*
*They cannot help but laugh, this experience has been so harrowing, they uncontrollably begin cackling in anempathetic merriment.*




The laughter bounds around the cavern and bounces off the stalactites and stalagmites surrounding the party.  Their merriment is met with peace, calm, tranquility.  The sound of water can be heard, somewhere farther on the other side of the cavern.  Dripping brings them home to where they are, and how far under the surface they've gone...
*Maouelue is the first to recover his wits and gestures for calm. The party, slightly crestfallen, obliges. They take stock of the scene and a mild guilt forms in their diaphragms. It's all of a mess. What could the Muhlens possibly be doing down here? The group moves to a small outcropping they saw near the entrance and sits down to make camp and recover their strength.*
*They have no idea what time of day or night it might be, but it must be getting on. Stenchy takes the first watch as the group sits down to their rations and dwindling water supplies.*

Stenchy's had a tough day.  Although he found some good gear, fighting in it, wearing it, using the new magical items...  it has taken a toll on the big man.  He's tired.  And as his head nods down... down... down... As his friends sleep blissfully innocent dreams of treasures to come and mysteries to solve...  There is a hiss of something thrown in the air at the group.  (Give me a d4 roll.  Dieter 1, Frenchy 2, Maouelue 3, Stenchy 4)
The javelin hits Stenchy *hard* in the chest plate, doing 6 points of damage.  A war scream comes from the NE section of the cave, followed by an answering call from due E.  There is a sound of padded feet running *fast* directly at the group.  (Initiative!)

OR1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (15) + 1 = `16`.

*Frenchy moves back behind his countryman and takes a pot shot with the crossbow.*


The orc beats it's chest as it hears the javelin pierce flesh.


The grizzly orc chief stands his ground.  A little frostier than he'd like to be, but regardless, sneers at the party.  He bangs his sword against his shield, letting out another whooping war cry.
"Send out your warrior.  I wish to battle him."
(He'll hold an action at this point.)
The sneer turns to a grim frown.


The orc says, "I would not try to throw that trinket this way again.  You might lose your toy."
