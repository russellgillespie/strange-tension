strange-tension*The metal mage makes meticulous measure of the map made marchable by means of might.*
*He moves into the room, and takes additional measurements.*
*He moves around...to the left...wrapping around the back of the barrow.*
*As a matter of fact...he means to dash!*
Effect invis removed from Dieter Deleter.
The one thug sees Maouelu move off and jumps in the window to wake his friend up.  The other is going to take a couple swats at the swarm.



"GAH!"
"BzzBzzBzzBzzBzzBzzBzzBzz"
"Let's kill these arseholes!"
The woman goes out to the vestibule to find the men.
*Maouelue mashes his way around the SE corner of the barrow and whips out his frosty ball, slinging it at the thief, old-school style.*

*He brushes some metal flakes off of his shoulders.*
"One good orb deserves another..."
*He blues another ball.*
The thug being accosted by the bugs sees a blue ball fly by him and has had enough.  He roars and rushes at Maouelue.  (AOO from the bugs.)

Effect invis removed from Maouelue.
*He pulls back the Blade of the Mists flat, elbow bending behind the pauldrons...*

*Another ball goes blue.*

A thug goes to swat at the swarm and the other one tries for Maouelue...  again.





"bZZ"

*Maouelue takes one of his icy balls and begins chanting to it, beckoning it to swirl round and round and....*






The woman screams and throws her crossbow down.  She takes her mace out and rushes at Maouelue.




*He steps another ball into the freezer.*


The last one standing starts to run away.  (AOO from swarm.)

*Beeter turns to Dieter again as the shifting form moves up to the NE corner. The wild-eyed druid pulls out his trusty boomerang and hurls it at the fleeing thief!*

"Damn it! He's getting away Maouleue!"


She's going to try to run away as well.  (AOO from Mao, if he wants.)

*As the blade hits, the Metal Mage teleports in front of the fleeing thief.*
"No."


*The metal mage is still a bit misty it would seem.*
The woman slips around the mage, running away.
*He mist.*
*As he sees the fleeing thief, he pities her a bit. What foul lord had corrupted her will to bring her to this moment?

He steps out slowly, just far enough to clear a line of sight to the runner. The metal hums a tune as the mage bends and sways calling out, guiding the light of the lord!*

"Lord have mercy on her soul."
The woman *explodes*.
The thug continues to run, hearing the *splurt* of his friend exploding in the distance.
*The druid flees after the evasive prey, looking out for where it has gone...*

*A shining golden star streaks through the air at the fleeing thief. A trail of green streams behind it, then red showers mar the scene as one of the blades sinks deep in the back of the neck of Dieter’s prey.*
*The hunter scans the surroundings for the final missing assailant.*



*Blood is in the air...*
The sun is set behind the trees in the west, the haze colors the sky red.  Matching the ground around Maouelue and Dieter.  In the distance to the north, Dieter can just make out another haze.  A cloud of dust is being kicked up.  The details are hard to see, but it is probably the posse coming.  At a glance, Dieter gives it about five minutes until they breach the barrow.
*Dieter quickly checks over the bodies, looking for loot and info. Maouleue does the same in the south before they rendezvous back in the barrow.*


Besides the very dirty clothes and ill-kept weapons, there is a piece of parchment crumpled up and stuffed in the man's trousers.  It reads, *"Be on the lookout for two men answering to the names Dieter and Maouelue.  (Descriptions follow.)  These men are bandits charged with stealing from the Runemark.  5000 gold piece ransom, dead or alive."*
*Dieter takes the message and they leave the bodies. They head back into the barrow and into a corner, Dieter once again goes invisible and Maouelue throws the net over himself.*


The tension (strange?) mounts as the hoofbeats get closer.  It sounds like thunder, Dieter and Maouelue try to count the number and get lost in the cacophony.   Tense minutes pass.  Finally, graciously, the thunder subsides and sounds of many feet hit the ground.  This isn't just the posse, it's the cavalry.  Steps start hitting stone, and a pair of rugged, muck-trodden boots jump in through the window, swords out and at the ready.  A familiar face scans the area.
"Come on now, lads...  I know you've tricks.  Tell you what, I'll put one o'these away and we can discuss terms, eh?"
Frume sheaths a rapier, but holds his Giant Slayer at the ready, in a dueling pose.
