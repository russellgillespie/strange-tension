<div class="character-1"><p>Frozen pellets careen around the wraith, battering it.  You can see wisps of blue-purple smoke wafting from the tattered holes in it's feathery cloak.  It looks at the wizard, who has been pelting it with so many ice balls.  The wraith's head cocks to one side, leering at it's prey...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A scream from the bowels of hell is unleashed by the wraith.  It turns its head to the remaining party members...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Briffo sees the wizard get clawed.  Praying that the damage is something reparable, he puts his hand over the wizard's chest...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As the wraith bends over to land possibly the killing blow to the halfling man, the cold gets incredibly intense.  Almost to the point where the party can't breathe.  The pressure lessens for the group, however, as the cold persists on the wraith, locking it's limbs enough to have the wraith miss clawing the little one.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The swirling energy is now ebbing and flowing, not a consistent blue-purple glow.  The cold has ebbed as well, but a rime of frost has built up on the apparition now.  It's brittle, crackling, creaking.  It looks scared... and dangerous.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wraith's eyes glow a bright red as it eyes Briffo.  The halfling grasps a locket around his neck and whispers something.  The claws come down.  They pass through his frame, and Dieter and Maouelue see a cloudy substance come away from Briffo's body.  The light leaves his eyes as he falls back to the cold stone floor.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There is a lightening in the foyer, a softness comes into the room.  The cold abates significantly.  A sad sort of peace comes to the two adventurers.  There is a certainty of finality here.  Not for the mission or the mysteries of the house, but for their friend.  Although they both want things to be different, the vacant stare of their newly found and newly gone friend is both heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.  The halfling wears a beatific smile, hand still clutching the totem around his necklace.  Soft sounds of rain can be heard now, pattering on the escarpments and damaged grounds of the old Muhlen Manor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter let’s Maouelue’s words wash over him and a steely determination sets about him. He begins to stare at Briffo with a fury, as if forcing this image into his being so that he may remember this solemn hubris. After a few moments, he closes Briffo’s eyes, then moves his hand from the locket. Dieter looks down and attempts to open it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue now comes over too and makes a ritual gesture of peace. He then bends down and begins to remove Briffo’s worldly burdens. As he does this, he pulls out the rings and the Rod of Sky Explosions. He offers the Ring of Invisibility over to Dieter and puts the Ring of Poison Resistance and the Ring of Protection on.</i></p></div>
