strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The three in the middle of the room are scared, hearing movement above them, all around them.  Strange sounds bring them to the height of panic.  Maouelue sees above where the creature was clinging to the wall, a hole begins.  Out of it, a massive head pokes out.   This creature is at least three times as large as the thing they just massacred.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the head and body continue writhing out of the hole, making it's way down the wall, <i>another</i> head pokes out...   this one even larger than the last...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As the thing crawls down the wall, it pauses at the body of it smaller member.  It lets out a screech and a cry that rattle the walls, then stares at the wizard.  (The roar will be one action, they each have two attacks they can make.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The carrion crawler moves down the wall, searching prey out with it's snoot.  It latches onto Maouelue's scent, and also senses the group not too far way from him.  He can't quite reach the wizard (in melee), so it's going to lash out with its tentacle...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard gets <i>slapped</i> by the dripping tentacle, feels the burn of the poison, but staves it off to fight on.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The crawler mauls into the two people in front of it, slavering rows of teeth crunching on the wizards arm.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gaping maw closes in on the wizard.  At the last minute, it's stopped by something, clangs against it again, but can't get close to the wizard.  (Great move!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big mamma-jamma opens it's maw and goes after the wizard again!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It roars and tries to back away.  (Out of melee, since you already used a reaction, you aren't able to get an AOO.)</p></div>
