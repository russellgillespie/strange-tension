<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue kisses his lucky bow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue readies five arrows, Men in Tights style, and only one arrow lands true...  in the last dead hell hound.  The group is silent behind him.  Even Benna.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>[3500 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around at the frozen bloody bits of hellhound sinew scattering the area. He chuckles slightly and looks around at his companions. "Well, that was nine hells of a run! Glad to be warm and safe at last! Perhaps we should take a rest and gather ourselves here."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The crew looks for a secure place to rest, and they try to attune to which direction the heat seems to originate from.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group is able to remove themselves from the disgusting stew.  Once they move the dead hound bodies, they are able to find a sufficient corner to rest in, decently secure in their safety.  (Short/long rest?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks with concern at the sisters. Bella having lost her magic and Benna...well, Benna was anyone’s guess, but though she seemed to enjoy the rapids ride, she certainly could do with some down time. Maouelue looks at Daran. “Let us set up camp again here for the...whatever time it is. Daran, could you take the first watch while I recover my mana?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran says, "Aye," and starts setting up a perimeter.  He then sets to investigating the hounds for choice bits.  Benna helps.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few hours later, at the end of the wizard's meditation, he opens his eyes to find a small cookfire set with a choice stew simmering in a pot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Daran, you king! This looks delicious! Thank you friend. I will take your watch whenever you would like."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks over and check on the sisters' comfort before digging in to the stew.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the mage eats, he looks around considering their options. While he had not intended their entrance into the cave to be permanent decision, there was no doubting the heat here was a welcome relief to the blizzard that raged upon them outside. Now to find a way out...or further in...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna giggles and says, "You like-a tha stew, eh!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A fire starts in your belly.  Benna says, "To be honest, it's more of a gruel than a stew.  But it get's the job done!"  <i>Cackle, cackle</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Mmm! Mmhmmm....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A song of ass and fire...</i>, broods Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Speaking of jobs, I seem to have gotten us into quite the pickle here. Let us consider our options.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Assessing the lake again, aside from the holes in the wall letting in the water streams, there is an alcove due E in the water, one N of the camp, and another small walkway S of the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s take a look at this Southern route first.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran takes his reverie while the group eats and rests.  Bellatrix gets her full compliment of sleep, but wakes up still feeling groggy.  Maybe due to the surroundings?  The camp is broken down quickly and the foursome make to scout the southern pass.  Maouelue can feel, as they all head that direction, that the air does seem to get warmer this direction.  (Marching order?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue conjures his familiar again as they pack their things.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A dark raven appears on the mage's shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>"Fly on ahead. Scout out the southern passage."</span></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bird flies 50 feet south, hitting a fork in the craggy tunnel.  It is familiar to the waterways above, complete with rocky outcroppings throughout.  The floor, however, is fairly well worn and the ceilings are 25 feet high in places.  At the intersection, there is a tunnel going NW, one going SW and yet another moving SE.  All water has completely evaporated here as it is stiflingly hot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The crew follows and takes the NW route. The bird scouts ahead as they move.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bird flies farther into the NW tunnel, then sends an emotion of fear back before the telepathic tether is cut.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is what the bird sees just before the tether is broken.  You don't get the feeling that it's dead, however.  Just out of range.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue raises a finger to alert the rest and whispers for everyone to draw their weapons. </p><p>“Does anyone have something to silence our approach? I’m a bit...clang-ey...”</p></div>
