strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p>The Elk, staring wildly, flees back and North toward the central chamber, knowing the other way to be a dead end.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fleeing, the elk charges out of the room, through the center circular room, and into the northernmost room, slowing and turning to sense if  their enemy reciprocates.</p><p></p><p>Seconds later, Elkamigo feels confident that it isn't right on their tail.  Still, he watches.  </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile...  (Maouelue, we're going to do these death saves...  whenever you're ready.)</p><p></p><p>(BTW, Dieter had the amulet, correct?)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Poopootrip!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage, amidst a fever dream of fire and ice, sees a platinum sheen behind his closed eyes.  He's then rocketed back to consciousness, in the most pain he's ever been in, dangling atop his trusty steed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, reaches wearily for his pack, knowing that trying his magic in this state would be folly. He pulls out two small, swirling red bottles and unstoppers them both. He quaffs them with reckless abandon.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell</p><p>Rolling 2 iterations...</p><p>2d4 (<b>4</b>, 2) + 2 = <code>8</code></p><p>2d4 (3, 3) + 2 = <code>8</code></p><p>16 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hyuuuuugggh!!!” A breath flies into the mage’s lungs as a bellows takes in its searing air.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elk bleats, worriedly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Find...the...sisters....” he gasps as he falls prone again against the antlers.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets close to passing out, but keeps the blackness on the edge of his periphery at bay.  As the mage made his escape through the area, he can't recall passing his other two companions.  And he can't hear anything now, save for very distant grinding of ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Elkamigo looks around wildly as he approaches the center room, unsure of which way to go around the circle, yet keen to avoid the all-too-familiar ice block in the center. He turns left, somehow out of force of habit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair make their way yet again around the circular room, heading off into the last hallway they haven't checked yet.  It leads to a set of stairs, then doubles back on itself to another set.  It repeats this a few times more, always climbing upwards and doubling back on itself.  Finally, Elkamigo and Maouelue are led into a corridor which branches into two halls.  East leads into a small room with a solid block of ice covering the entire eastern wall.  North has a few alcoves with more suits of armor in them, ending in another hall leading north.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you." says the chastened mage to his furry fey friend. "I...I...would be <i>gone</i> without you..." Tears begin to fall from the Sylvan's darkened eyes, crystalline as the freeze upon his face. "I've nearly lost everything now.... The sisters! Oh where could they be?"</p><p></p><p>He slumps down and Elkamigo nestles in to the corner bay to their South, propping up the miserable mage, who goes about tending to his wounds.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The chill begins to reach its way into the heart of the Dragon Mage. He teeters on the edge of consciousness.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halls up here echo with a faint breeze, coming from the north corridor.  Maouelue, as he's healing and taking a moment to gather his bearings, can hear the groaning of the castle below him, seemingly shifting on it's moorings.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He peers warily at the suits of armor, unsure if he could take another onslaught at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The armor looks exactly like the ones downstairs, just not animated.... yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bedraggled, the mage summons what's left of his spirit to at least try and prepare for the encounters ahead.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aaaaaahhhhh now that’s the stuff! I’m a bit low on my mana reserves but I’ll mana-ge... eh? eh? Oh right, you’re just a beast...I wonder where those sisters could be. Bella might not have liked it, but I <i>know</i> Benna would have at least guffawed.... Oh listen to me prattling on...”</p><p></p><p>He gathers himself and pushes on with Elkamigo through the rows of armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The suits of armor do not make a sound as the metal mage lumbers through the corridor, the loud <i>clack</i> of his amigo's hooves bouncing around the room.  A right turn at the end of the hall leads to another corridor running E, ending in a right turn.  Midway down, a left 90 degree turn leads into a fog-shrouded room.  Not much can be seen from the entrance to this room, and no noise greets the pair as they approach.</p></div>
