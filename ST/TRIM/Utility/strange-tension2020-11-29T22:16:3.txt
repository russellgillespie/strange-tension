"Now's as good a time as any to discuss the bastards over at the old mansion.  You start, maybe I can fill in the gaps."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Fill in the gaps...?</i>”</p><p><i>Ouelue gestures coyly...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...then ribs the flustered Daran.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“What can you tell me of this foul lot?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He now looks <i>very</i> flustered.  He's not used to other people travelling with him, let alone a female half-elf.  Even though he knows it's not.  But does he, really?  As I said, he's very flustered!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well...  <i>Ahem</i>, well now, let's see...  They came around pretty quickly only a few days ago.  They stopped by Oakhurst then set up camp at the mansion same day.  Their numbers have been growing every day.  Seems like something new comes into the camp at an hourly pace, I don't know where they're getting their supply of followers from.   Wherever it is, the well is deep, apparently.  Plus, I hear tell of some extremely strange... misfits in the camp.  Were-folk, mages, some even suggest arch-mages, if you can believe that.  Could have sworn I saw a Red Wizard of Thay go into the main box they have up on the hill.  Use that as the inner sanctum, I s'pose.  It's been covered over by now with tents and canopies and the like.  It's either a small festival, or a large traders outpost, depending on what you're more familiar with.  My fear is that they'll start to overrun Oakhurst, but they seem to be leaving it alone for the time being.  You say you think that's where they took your friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Honestly, who knows... The golem took him North. Could probably follow his tracks come to think of it. I’ve got this here net that might come in mighty handy. Might have to slip into this fine bit o’ splint first though if I’m going to covert route...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>(S)he considers this a moment, then begins to disrobe and slowly don the splint.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, oh dear.  Let me...   I'll just be down by the stream, there..."  He rushes down to the stream.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue is getting a real kick out of this for some reason.

<div class="character-1"><p>"No, no.  You're fine lad.  The get-up.  Just...  reminded me of someone, was taken aback.  Way back, actually.  You're fine, son.  Let's continue on.  Be on the lookout for more brigands as we get farther north, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Ouelue raises a watery eye.</i></p><p></p><p>“Thank you. Yes, let’s be going. Eyes on the prize.”</p></div>
