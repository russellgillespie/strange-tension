strange-tension<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shoves him aside and sniffs at the lady, his snout turning a bit long and whiskered...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume steps further into the room, saying "Whoa, Dieter, what's going on?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Baeeestttsss! Grreaaaauuuuuueeeoooogggh!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leads them back over to the door with the star key.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a wistful look back, Frume follows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group is clearly beginning to suffer from their long stint underground. Maouelue is losing the thread of his righteous vigor. Dieter is aping out unwittingly. The metal mage rushes over to the door and instead the star key, twisting hard.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door swings effortlessly open.  Torchlight sputtes momentarily, but resolves on a mountain of platinum bars, all stamped with a seal of a foundry from Waterdeep.  All tallied, there are 100 bars of platinum, totalling 5,000 lbs.  A pound of platinum yields 10 coins.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A gleam pierces the armor clad mage’s eye...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is slack-jawed at the sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They begin hoarding.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Spitefully the druid pitches in. This dread chain they have forged...the relentless pull of fate...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As they finish up, they move to the other end of the room and look at the translucent door again.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The orange moves as a fire would've seemingly casting shadows on the other side.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sends a bolt of fire at the orange phantasm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame goes through the door and the barrier evaporates.  The heat hits the three hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group looks into a room with an enormous vat of what appears to be lava as the centerpiece.  There is a scalloped edge with the lava pooling ten feet below the floor of the rest of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks worried, but stands by the door, weapon ready.  He shrugs. "Can't close it, but I'm here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue begins stacking platinum bars outside the pit...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Apeiter shrugs and turns back into a man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out the gold he has just looted as well and stacks it, taking the mage's lead. They both had business here it would seem.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue begins searching around for large pieces of rock that he can begin to pile up.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter begins looking for scraps of wood.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both look at the giant banded door, then back at each other, then back at the door, then back at each other, then move to the giant door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to dismantle the door at the hinges.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They alternate at freezing and heating the hinges in quick succession. They weave back and forth between them, mimicking each other in reverse. Much like they had when tracing the circle of runes in their trance way back at the house of Ilmater. Something in the chaos of these moments has led the two back to their weird synchronicity. There they continued to work. One in gold and wood, the other in platinum and zeal. On and on they worked at the metal until....</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume tries to lend the other two a hand (the only one he has), but they're in lock-step.  Frume keeps watch for any signs of intruders instead.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They two work together to dismantle the door and attempt to build it into some work surfaces. In one end of the lava room, they set up a long thin box and reinforce it with iron.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The one they call Deleter digs inside his pack for some long forgotten tools. He thinks to himself, just how handy inter-dimensional storage really is when it's all said and done.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Now they search about for a cornerstone. Something large and flat. Something that can take a beating...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They think back to moments ago...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The woman...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Yes...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's perfect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They bid Frumious to stand guard over their construction. He wouldn't be on any help anyway, not really for what they were up to.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, curious.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They walk back around to the manacled woman and inspect the dais.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They look at its base and the construction thereof.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What appears to be solid gold, or maybe gilded in it.  The woman is still motionless on the table.  A wound still in her chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to lift the platform off its base.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is solidly secured to the floor.  (Less a table, more an altar.  Solid rectangular piece of metal or gilded stone.)</p></div>
