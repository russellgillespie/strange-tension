strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>As the party gets to their feet, they are greeted by another torch-lit room.  It's oval in general shape, 35ft side to side, 20ft deep, with a small alcove to the S  (The door you came through is on the W).  On the N wall are three wooden coffins, similar to the ones you've seen before.  There is a <i>much</i> larger coffin on the S side, just N of the alcove, running W to E lengthwise.  The torches flicker.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue walk over to the three small coffins to inspect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are paintings on these, snake-men-warriors in gentle repose.  The coffins look better made than the ones in the other rooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They open these as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They open onto the same clay statues as the rooms prior.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves over to the large coffin and inspects it while Dieter hangs back.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is a bit more well made, thicker, heavier.  The wood is in better condition.  The picture on t he front is of a huge looking snake-man with a long tail instead of legs, and two massive arms.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The reliefs tell of some battles between an ancient race of serpents called Naga, and their elven, human, and dwarven enemies.  These depictions show the Naga as heroic vanquishers of the humanoid races.  (More in a sec.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the short rest wanes, you receive a rush of emotion as you connect with the silver ring.  It is a device made by the Naga, a weapon of sorts.  If you put it on, you can retain a particular skill the Naga possess.  It would transform a part of your body into a serpent appendage, giving it the ability to deliver poison damage with an unarmed strike.  Maouelue feels dread and a sense of warning, but at the same time, emanating in waves from the object, he feels a great sense of power and righteous anger.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands the ring to Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the ring and turns it over a few times, taking his own read on its energies.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sense you get from the ring, tapping into the Naga-created object, pushing into the understanding of the types of beings these serpents were...  Dieter is pummeled by a barrage of emotion, mainly vengeance.  Anger and pain war within him as he senses the motives of the Naga.  These beings are pure hate and atrocity.  They wanted nothing more to see the world burn and be recreated by their serpent gods.  Magical items they made for themselves are extremely powerful.  Those left for whomever might find them have...  secrets.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gestures to the center of the room. The group makes to gather coffin tops from all the rooms and place them out end to end in a long sort of platform arrangement.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the other two get on with this arrangement, Maouelue attempts to lift the clay statue in the first room on the left they entered.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He attempts to lift and drag it back to the oval room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The clay statue starts to slip...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He catches it <i>inches</i> from the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With some effort, the two safely bring it back into the larger room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The three companions continue bringing all the rest to the platform they’ve constructed.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All of the clay statues are now in the large room.  None have cracked or are broken, save the one the ring was taken off of.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gestures to the final coffin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tries to free a hand and steady Frume with a divine word.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sneezes and grumbles something that sounds suspiciously like “pious poser”...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The clanking metal from the cleric’s gesticulations prevents him from hearing this.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A fifteen lifts it, but just barely...  Muscles tense and flex in Maouelue and Frume's arms, your whole body is taut moving this coffin.  The wood is probably petrified.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stink that comes from the coffin is horrendous.  Like dead fish and stagnant ocean water mixed with rotting snakeskin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lid is <i>slowly</i> moved off of the coffin, revealing a horrendous looking snake-man.  Muscled and sinewy, with two large arms and stacked torso, it has a python-like mantle on it's head.  It's lower half is that of a large snake, complete with rattler on the end.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Doeter takes out a length of rope and ties the mouth shut, shuddering.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks at the thing and starts to wrap his rope around the thing's mouth.  He could swear he heard a rattle...  but maybe it's just his nerves?</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter quickly wraps up the knot and draws the blade end of his staff, pointing it at the snake man and quivering.</i></p></div>
