strange-tensionThere is scoring on many bones.  Dieter sees that some scoring could have come from animals, but there a quite a few bones with notches clearly made with weapons.





*The ragtag party rouses themselves from their brief sojourn feeling much better prepared to take on the upcoming uncertainty.*
Dieter and Maouelue take a rest, studying the bones and nourishing themselves.  Near the end of an hour, the flames on the torch begin to sputter and fade.  The darkness seeps in from the outer corridor.  The sounds of scratching and gnawing can be heard very clearly now, sounding like it's coming in your direction.




Deleted counter MaouelueXP.
Deleted counter DieterXP.





*Maoulue signals silently to Dieter with a raised finger to his lips. Dieter moves to obscure himself to the left of the room entrance, while Maouelue uses his Darkvision to scout along the corridor for the source of the sounds.*
Peering around the corner you can barely see a pile of garbage at the far end of the corridor.  A swarm of rats is picking over the remnants.  None seem to notice you, however.  For the moment.
*Maouelue casts Mage Hand and places an unlit torch in its grip. He then directs it telepathically to move directly over the swarm of rats. He signals for Dieter to come forward quietly.*
*Dieter moves forward and casts Produce Flame directly on the torch just as Maouelue instructs his Mage Hand to release it, dropping the flaming torch onto the rat swarm.*


The majority of the rats do not see you, but there are several coming down the corridor, the ones that have been left out of the garbage pile.  And they're very hungry.
*Maouelue rolls his eyes at Dieter.*

SW1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (12) + 0 = `12`.












The rats focus on Dieter, the only one seemingly doing damage to them.  They swarm at him, overwhelming him, and bite simultaneously.  Dieter is overcome and falls to the floor, rats flailing all around him.
*Maouelue uses a Greater potion of healing on Dieter*


Dieter, bloody and bitten, jumps up after receiving the healing potion, rats flying everywhere.  He takes a mighty swipe with his sword, slashing through several.

A smallish rat bites the wizards ankle.



As a last ditch effort, the rest of the remaining rats make a mad dash (slower than usual with the ray of frost), and they all take little chunks out of Dieter's hide.



*Dieter crudely thrusts his curved blade into the final ratâ€™s mouth.*
As the blood from the last rat splashes on the walls of the cavern, quiet descends along the corridor.  Nothing moves for a few minutes, the two magic users take time to catch their breath.

*Dieter uncorks the final Greater Potion of Healing and downs it.*
The swirling red liquid goes down the gullet.  Amazingly, the wounds knit themselves together in short order.
*Dieter and Maouelue make their way back up to the main chamber and continue rotating clockwise through the tunnels, heading down the northeast passage.*
*The entrance to this passage is supported
by two wooden pillars and you find another
discarded on the floor as you move along it.
The passage is about 4 foot wide and after
about thirty feet splits in two. The left hand
path leads north and the right north, north
East.*
*Dieter and Maouelue shift the beam to cover the NNE tunnel and the path they came from, moving forward into the North tunnel. Dieter then sets the beam alight!*

*They move further down the now-lit corridor, at a medium pace.*
*The tunnel comes to an end after about ten
foot and again splits into two. You can see
the end of both which appear to be small,
rough chambers from where you stand.
They seem empty. Rubble litters the floor.*
*The party splits to quickly inspect each room more closely. Dieter to the left, Maouelue to the right.*
There's nothing but rubble and roughly used miners tools.  Nothing to see down either corridor.  There is still the NNE passage, however...
*Dieter picks up a mining pick and a shovel the. Heads back to the fork and asks Maouelue to put them in the bag*
*The group heads back to the previous fork in the cavern. Maouelue uses his mage hand to rotate the flaming log to allow their passage into the NNE corridor.*
With the yule log to guide your way, you backtrack to the fork and take the NNE passage.
*As you move down the passage you begin
to smell something foul. The air rapidly
becomes thick and you know that this is the
smell of death. After about 12 foot the
junction comes to an abrupt end. On your
right is the entrance to a narrow room from
which emanates the foul smell.*
*Dieter nods.*
*Maouelue picks a burning ember from the Yule log with the Mage Hand and tosses us into the narrow room.*
*You can see around a jagged
corner, where the rock appears recently
mined, you find a small 5 by 5 space. On
the floor lies a humanoid body whose
upper half has been crushed by falling rock
with only its legs showing, which are
clothed in hemp trousers and worn leather
boots. You cannot see the upper torso.
Beside the heap is long pickaxe and a
rectangular box, approximately a two by
three foot.*
