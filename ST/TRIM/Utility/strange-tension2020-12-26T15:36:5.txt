strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>"No riddles here.  I gave you the information you need to get through the doors.  Finding my body and resurrecting me is in both our interest.  Then I will be able to show you a way out of this juggernaut.  We are done here.  Act in any way you see fit."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And in a wisp of blue-grey smoke, the void collapses in on itself.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is standing where he was last, in the vast, cold room with the banners, the columns, and a very confused Frume.  He was just grasping air a second ago, now his hand is grabbing your leg.  His mouth hangs agape, trying to piece things together.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dastardly Demon....”, Dieter spits.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Riddles encased in a labyrinth entombed in a mystery!”, The disgusted druid deliberates.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As his sight comes back to, he lays eyes on Frume and thinks for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wwww...  What happened??  Did you...  go somewhere?  You just flashed!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I...had a vision of a way out though...it will not be simple.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks worried.  "Aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye. What of you? You seem to have taken quite a shock yourself? What was it happened to you?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I'm sobered up after that light came down and flashed on you!  Thought you were going to be spirited away or summat..."  He takes a deep breath, trying to center himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ah! I’m sure you are, I’m sure you are friend, and for that I am grateful.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes a beat...”Frume, this may seem odd, but I’m fearful we could be in for a fair amount of trouble before we make it out of here. You have been so great a companion, I am embarrassed not to have asked you more about yourself. Hells! I don’t even know your last name, ha! Pray, let us become better acquainted.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’ll start. My full name is Dieter Deleter, druid of the coast. I come from the sword coast on an island just west of the Trollbark Forest. My family name is actually De Liter, but after....after the tragedy, I was banished and branded Deleter until I return in with my honor and receive absolution.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter starts speaking, talking of surnames and histories, the druid sees Frume start to close off, slightly.  Something in his eyes gives Dieter that there is something there that makes Frume conflicted.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah, partly my fault, I guess.  Truly well met, Dieter.  I'm actually from around the area.  Lived close to Oakhurst all my life.  My last name..  is Bandersnatch.  Family name after a great-great ancestor slayed an enormous beast from the Abyss.  I'm sorry to hear of the tragedy in your history, I truly am.  After all you've done, would you not be able to return redeemed now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is skeptical.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ah! You’re from around Oakhurst? Where did you live?  In the hills? By the river? A big house outside of town?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last line gets him.  His eyes go wide and he looks down at his feet.  Slowly, he says, "What kind of vision did you have there, friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Don’t mean to gloss over the bit about the Abyssal beast as well, that sounded fierce!”...”Wait, oh what’s that? Didn’t catch you there...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Head still down, eyes still downcast, he turns and walks toward the S door.  He starts speaking very heavily, as if the words cause him great pain and are being wrenched from him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"My first explanation to you was a bunch of lies, I was never the hero of a town nor did I lose everything in a fire.  Well... not until recently.  You and Maouelue burned down my family home, so technically, I guess my first statement did come to pass...  in a matter of speaking."  He looks up at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't get me wrong, if I coulda burned the fuckin' place to the ground before, I would 'ave!  My real name is Jaecob Muhlen.  I'm one of several middle sons of the Muhlen throng.  And," his eyes grow sorrowful, "I'm the Runemark."</p></div>
