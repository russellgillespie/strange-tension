strange-tensionThe barrage keeps coming, felling yet another thug.  The hoofbeats get closer, closer, closer...  The group in the trees fear for their friends life...  and then they hear the growling.  Coming from behind them...
*Maouelue turns his head in slow motion...*
Red eyes stare at the mage out of the darkness.  Slavering and chomping of maws can be heard 20 feet away.  The animals almost completely blend into the night.

*Stenchy considers his targets, looking over the dread creatures lurking in the forest.*




They look really friendly to everyone but Maouelue!  He knows them to be dire wolves.



*Stenchy, seeing his leader fall, picks a potion from the pack of the person who pilfered his plate. Proffering it to his prone pal, he pours...*
*Quenchy is too close for missiles, he's switching to blades.*


*Frenchy gets up and is pissed off.*



"Take the druid or the metal man, kill the others," says the knight.
*Hearing this, the Druid bristles...*


*He sends a flame at the presumptuous knight, then a mess of Dieters tucks further into the woods.*
The other man turns, his face scarred and battered from years of rugged living.  The dark eyes flit to the many druids and smiles.  He spurs his mount towards the group of Dieters and tries to land a successful hit.  (Same situation, so 76-100 hits the real Dieter.)




The grizzled man's nose blackens, his fingers turn dark.  He grimaces and casts a severe look at the mage.



The first dire wolf starts gnawing Quenchy's foot...

The wolf is at a loss as to why that devastating bite didn't set the metal man down.  (Arf?)



Effect Prone removed from Frenchy.


The black knight moves to flank Stenchy.

*Dieter runs over toward quenchy and drops a superior potion on the ground, then casts...*

The grizzled man looks at the group of Dieters and laughs, cracking his blackened hands.

He swings and misses, but still smiles at you.



*Stenchy picks up the potion Dieter dropped and quaffs it.*







Trying to catch the staff and failing, the man back-gallops and hops off the horse.  He spurs the mount back north through the barrow, and goes to attack Stenchy.
As he approaches he draws a short sword and side-eyes Dieter.








*He gets up again..*
Effect Prone removed from Frenchy.





"Arf, arf, arf!!"
Furious at missing twice last time, he's going to switch focus.  (AOO from Stenchy!)

*Dieters sneer*





The last duplicate *poofs* with the bite of the dire wolf, making it irate.





The last Dieter duplicate falls.  Dieter then hears... *boom*, *boom*, *BOOM* coming from the north of the barrow.





Looking towards the north, the black knight whips back around and tries to make a grab at Maouelue!

The knight grabs the the Dragon Mage and does an arm lock, to ensure he can't escape.  He spurs his mount toward the north, towards the booming sounds.  (Since I'm dragging him, I can only go 5ft...)

✅ Dieter Deleter added to group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).
Black Bear (Dieter Deleter) was added to combat with initiative 5 as part of group Dieter Deleter (Wild Shape).

*Maouelue flaps weakly, trying to break the grapple.*
It's a decent struggle, but he stays hooked.

The wolf next to Dieter suddenly yelps when a *fucking black bear* erupts in front of it.

*The metal mage slaps his sword at the Knight dragging him northward. The misty blade hits the Knight square and the mage’s form dissipates and reforms back by his party.*

*Just to rub it in, the mage frosts one of his balls right at the face of the knight.*
The knight realizes after a step that the metal man is not with him anymore.  He does a double take and stares at Maouelue, incredulously.  He stops his mount and points at the wizard.
*Maouelue points two fingers at his own eyes, then points them at the knight, then back and forth a few times.*
Seeing the black bear towering next to him, where a tasty treat was there just a moment before, it literally backs into Maouelue, who *also* wasn't there before either.  (AOO from Maouelue on the dire wolf, then he'll return the attack.)


It snarls at being pinned and lashes out.
*Stenchy is locked in mortal combat with the Vicious Entity...*


The knight blocks the blow without even looking at the henchman.
"Arf, arf, arf!!"






As Stenchy starts to back away the knight strikes out and pierces the man, driving him to the ground.


The wolf is now pissed at Frenchy...  it has no idea what to make of Maouelue any more.
