strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't grasp the markings on the bands of iron, they're eroded away too much.  Something, some nugget of a memory pops into Dieters mind, completely unbidden.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He remembers a story of an artificer, a maker of magical items.  He was a sailor, a pirate really, who searched far and wide for a special magic that would make his items renown the world over.  Across the seas, a land of giants harnessed the power of runespells.  Their brand of runic magic was so powerful, it was said to imbue items with a life of their own.  They didn't use their magic for wealth or power, but mainly protection from the outside world.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This pirate found their enclave, slew their leaders, and forced the shamans of the tribe to divulge all of their secrets.  In the years that followed, not only did the pirate become rich and powerful, he became unstoppable.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There came a day that the crew became so frightened of him, half of them mutinied while the other half fled as fast as they could.  Alone, listless on the high seas, the artificer's last days are unknown to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is something etched around the lock.  Dust and dirt obscure the writing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter rubs the corner of his shirt over the lock, then pours a dash of water from his skein to rinse off the residue. He peers intently...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can make out a couple runes, but not all.  <i>R-NE--R-</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas is about to say something, then stops, the thought fading before it really begins.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party loads whatever they can muster along with the chest and heads back to the cave entrance.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter disappointedly hangs his head and unwittingly lays eyes on his Henchmen Mirror. Oddly the face(s?) staring back at him is(are?) not his own...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Four henchmen (Please feel free to describe their look) appear out of thin air.  Douglas nearly jumps out of his skin, wondering how in that hell that happened.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With all seven of you working together, you manage to not only lift the chest but you all put it in the mine cart.  The four henchmen take positions at the rear, ready to push it into town for you.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The men merrily roll out to the front of the cave, the henchmen particularly enthusiastic about their good fortune!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party heads back to Oakhurst, the small town where you first met Culver and heard about Douglas's plight.  As you crest the ridge of the hill and head into outskirts of the town, children see your party coming and run up to you, throwing questions at you left and right.  Some run ahead to tell the townspeople of your coming.  By the time the seven of you finally get into the town proper, you're legends.  The wealth in your cart is more than most people in Oakhurst see in a lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are questions upon questions upon questions.  Offers of free drink and food at the Pig and Falcon come from the owner and patrons alike.  Merchants come up to you offering their wares at a discount, slyly peeking at the glorious wealth in your cart.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Oakhurst</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You search for Culver, he's nowhere to be found amongst the adoring crowd.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone quiets a bit and looks around from one to the other.  They call out for Culver, a few even send for him at his storefront.  Cheers go up and rise when the word of the Pig and Falcon come up.  Seems like the crowd will be heading there directly to save a good spot.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Some people did see the chest.  Dieter gets a <i>very</i> lowball offer for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The crew heads to the Pig and Falcon. Maouelue asks Douglas to arrange a room and a private entrance if possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are people literally falling out of Pig and Falcon.  Standing room only.  There is a table saved in absolute center of the room, waiting for your arrival.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head to The Sleeping Sheep and Maouelue enters to inquire about lodging. Dieter hangs back outside to guard the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue enters in and secures lodging for the minecart and the two original adventurers, a younger boy runs up to Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He doubles over, catches his breath, and blurts out, "Culver's shop...  Robbed..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Just got back from checking... Didn't see it happen.  Don't know what happened.  Name's Seeder?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He gives you a weird look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Co stable?"</p></div>
