<div class="character-1"><p>He raises his hands above his head, cups them, and as he brings them apart, an icy staff appears in his grip.  He levels it at Maouelue and the witch and says, "DIE!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A rain of ice, sleet, hail, and brute force winds pummel the two.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>Benna was added to combat with initiative 15.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bella, take these... may the material serve as your conduit!" He hands her 50 Platinum Pieces before rushing away from the ladies, wary of another area attack that could take them all.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Rar."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Away now Jerry!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ruff!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix looks at the twinkling Platinum in her hands, then casts a furtive glance over at her beacon of light, "Mao, are you sure about this? Remember last time?..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bella, this is Life <i>and</i> Death! I <i>know your fear</i>, but I will not let it overcome you! It is time! NOW!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She takes in a deep breath as she moves weirdly up the stairs only to turn back and shove her sister out of the way. "Away Benna!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her eyes go fully black, but in the reflection of ice and platinum, they somehow gleam a holy white, strange swirling marbles of all shades of grey. Bella's time has come. She takes the platinum and coughs forth dark blood encrusting her mouth from her recent bouts with death. The blackness coats the coins as she begins a foul incantation, flaring her arms and skirts in all directions, gesticulating like the undulating nethers of an earth goddess with both the power to give and take life, the cold hard reality of the universe flowing from her loins and running the length of the stairs, past the Pale Prince and taking root in the far northeast corner of the room. A desperate, dark web of runic vines begin to form from the material of the coins, shattering them and engulfing the prince and his bubble in a Circle of Death!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>With this, she falls back down the stairs and collapses in a heap next to her prone sister. One eye toward the ground in utter darkness, the other raised and reflecting fully, the shining white light.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Pain wracks the emaciated body lying on the ground.  As Bellatrix falls, the Prince's body flops in silent horror as black shadows cover him and sap his life force.  Bloody and bruised, he rises within the sphere, his supposed safeguard, and looks from the wolf to Maouelue, then back again.  His hand swipes blood from his chin, he regards it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Choices, choices.  Always choices.  Should I leave you with the pain I am in?   Or take you away from your material coil?  You and your furry companion.  What would twist the knife more?  What would make you look back on this moment and realize...  you and I are not so different.  We're almost the same person.  When you think about it..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He taps the staff on the ground and a ripple runs through the floor, straight at the two sisters...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Knives of ice protrude from the castle floor, impaling the women and rising them into the air.  The Pale Prince looks on, unfeeling.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes in the  chaos surrounding him, death, decay, sadness. For a moment his mind flickers to a Black Dragonborn, flying high on eagle’s back screaming into an unnatural storm. His vision returns to his love, his <i>family</i>...he sees, is it an illusion? Douglas...Culver...Briffo...</p><p></p><p>“Starlight strike true!”</p></div>
