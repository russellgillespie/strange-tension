strange-tensionLooking at the foul arrow in her arm, Bellatrix winces, but holds firm. 
"Oh, playing with missiles are we?.." She winks at Mao as the red of her armor begins to pulsate. The blood around her wound congeals weaving with dark black rivulets of magical force running to her fingertips and blasting outward in three short sharp shocks toward the perpetrator of her pain.

Bellatrix then ducks back behind cover, seeing if Benna is in any fit state to administer aid.


"Bellaaaa!"


Maouelue's fingertips glow again, but this time with a twinge of iridescent purple. His fingernails seem to grow out of the very tips of his gauntlets before four sleek bolts fly out and dart right at what seems to be a gate on the northwest side of the paddock, right next to the Unseelie! They ping one after another into the clasp...


Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping!
The clasp and part of the gate and paddock *explode* inward, shards of metal and splinters of wood careen all around.
A shard catches one of the unseelie eladrin under his armor, and he yells out in pain.  The monster in the cage doesn't seem to notice his freedom has been granted... yet.
After the barrage of bolts, a small, bluish orb seems to trail like a comet in the wake, beaming toward the second archer.


Maouelue turns back to move around the corner and shouts back toward the paddock, "You're free! Freeeeee!!!!"

The thing stops snapping and ripping at the fence, and looks towards Maouelue.  (Animal handling, please!)

The mage taps into his animal magnetism and coerces the thing to turn around and notice the opening.

Flustered, the crimson caster turns to the fray, once again sending a sanguine barrage at her attacker.

She dances a grotesque taunt at the failing fletcher, goading him toward the giant scorpion.

She sneers as she directs her victim into the paddock, right up next to the monster.


The hurt unseelie is going to yell and try to run...
The massive beast swipes and misses, the hurt eladrin runs for his life!  The other tries to stand his ground, jumping away from the creature, taking a shot, then running after his friend.

"Hmm...I don't think we'll let them get away *that* easy..."
"Freeze!"


"Now get 'em you beautiful bloody witch!"

It is not your turn.

The beast scrittles towards Bellatrix.



The first runs farther down the tunnel, the second follow, but flings an arrow behind them.

The bow breaks in half, the unseelie hisses and runs.
As he made his way up the tunnel, he fumbles and falls.  His friend tries to pick him up as he runs along, trying to pull him out of the tunnel.



Bellatrix is very much still focused on the large beast in her midst.  Maouelue, seeing the eladrin fall, hears from down the tunnel they were running,  the sound of more running feet - coming towards them.
Maouelue picks his head up, searching for the fallen eladrin, listening for the coming footsteps.  Suddenly, an arrow comes from the darkness beyond the fallen bodies, farther up the tunnel!
The arrow arcs over Maouelue, over Bellatrix...
...And lands in the middle of the creature's body, causing it to rise up and trash around wildly.
(Dex saves, please!)


Maouelue clambers away safely.  Bellatrix dodges just in time to miss an errant claw swiping through the air.  As they both fall to the ground, more arrows come from the black space, followed by summer and spring eladrin, bows trained and firing on the beast hovering over the heroes.  In a few moments, the cavalry arrives in full, killing the animal and a familiar face greets the fallen Maouelue.

"Thought we'd lost you, Dragon Mage,"says a battered Jelentrianna, captain of the guard of the Summer Court.  "There's quite a few folk going to be happy to see you alive and well."  She offers a hand to Maouelue and Bellatrix.  

"Only the two of you left?  What of the older woman and the ranger?"
"Well met Jelentrianna! A sight for sore...and cold eyes indeed! The lady Benna is recovering her strength around the corner, praise the Platinum. Our good friend Daran however... he is clouded from my sight. It seems he has faded, if not gone entirely.
"A fair tale we have to regale you with though to be sure! What of the assault, what of the dark Queen?"
