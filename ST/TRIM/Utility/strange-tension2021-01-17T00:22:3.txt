strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Up the crystal staircase, through the beatific front halls, the trio is led into a massive throne room.  Atop the central dais, an inescapably beautiful summer elf, golden skin and hair wafting in unseen wind, sits upon the main throne.  Her king to her right, also golden from head to toe, sits smiling.  Lastly, a woman on the Queen's left and closer to the front of the dais seems to be made completely of silver.  All three sit up in interest at the soldiers and outsiders stride to them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Queen Titania and King Oberon, I present Maouelue the Mage, Daran the Ranger, and Bellatrix the Wizardess, three being from the material plane, come to honor your highnesses."  She bows as before in the forest.  Daran and Bellatrix follow suit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue joins in the protocol gratefully, but skips a beat as he realizes for the first time that he doesn’t see the Sister. <i>Where has she gone?</i> He wonders. His attentions returning, he follows Otirnis’ lead.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen atop the dais nods to King Oberon, and he starts in giving a grand welcome.  In Maouelue's mind, however, he hears a light, flowery female voice.  "Do not be afraid, dear cousin.  Bella's sister is safe and well in her rooms here in Castle Starlight."  A smiling Queen Titania looks at Maouelue from her throne.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out with his feelings, trying to test the limits of this connection, maintaining eye contact with Titania throughout. </p><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>”Thank you for the hospitality and for assuaging my fears. I have read tome after long tome about the majesties of the star children. To be here in this moment is my greatest honor. May I be worthy of these hallowed halls in the end.”</span></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods, smiling.  King Oberon continues, and ends with a flourish.  There is polite clapping, he sits down, pride exuding from him.  The Queen gives him a wry smile.  She stands to address the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue casts a sideways glance at Bellatrix to see, among other things, whether she had a similar experience.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You all are most welcome here in the shining halls of our Castle Starlight.  We greatly appreciate your aid to our lands, and we sincerely hope there is more aid to offer, from both sides.  I look forward to hearing more of who our heroes are and what we can do to aid you in your fight.  Let us remove to our planning room.  I would hear more from each of you, if you please."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She was walking down the dais, and, in making the last statement, hits the main floor.  She waves the group over to a side room, and leads them to a beautifully decorated, catered room.  Food lines the wall and are piled on the table.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gives Bella a look, she looks back questioningly at him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Seeing her lack of understanding at his look, he quickly pivots to gesture to the grandeur of the Castle in all its glory, and that food...it is now that Maouelue realized he hasn’t <i>properly</i> eaten in weeks, if he could trust time anymore...the delicate spread takes over his conscience as they are led to the  reception.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The full opaque crystal doors are drawn wide, showing an expansive room.  Not quite as large as the throne room, it's centerpiece is a massive transparent table, ovoid with many embellished chairs in the elven design.  On the table are varied stands of dried and fresh fruits, nuts, and light breads.  Large platinum ewers decorate the table with what looks to be wine.  Tables are set up along the sides of the main meeting space.  These are piles high with dishes both exotic and breathtaking.  Platinum bowls and serving plates hold tremendous amounts of delicacies.  There is a roasted bird about the size of two turkeys at the center, flanked by pink fish with a fiery sauce, greens and exotic-colored vegetables, stuffed pastries, and odd round objects covered in white shavings.  Flowers abound, mixing with the spicy and sweet aromas of the food.  The Queen says, "Eat, drink, be merry.  We will talk while we enjoy our heroes feast!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Servants stand at attention for anyone who needs assistance.  Several cellerars are standing in wait with drinks, if the table wine is not wanted.  The Queens and King stride through, picking at the table foods and finding their seats at the table's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Moments later, the old woman is brought down and she and Bellatrix have a happy reunion.</p></div>
