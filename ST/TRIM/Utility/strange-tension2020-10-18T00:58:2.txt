There is a bandolier hanging on the bookshelf by a door to the W.  There is a hallway on the E wall, on it's south end.  There is another door on it's north end.  This one looks stained with something...
*Dieter walks over to inspect the bandolier.*
*He compares it to the poison one he carries.*
It's a very nicely made leather bandolier, this one carries parchment.  Scroll cases and buckles adorn the carrier.  Oddly, it looks almost new.
*He pulls it down and puts it on.*
It's a good fit!
*They move east through the door.*
The group goes through the hallway.  More wear and tear can be seen through here.  Tapestries are moth eaten or completely ripped down.  The hallway widens to a small entry room.  A door to the N and a door to the E.  The door to the N looks stained with something.
*Maouelue nods to the group and they head over to the stained door to inspect.*


It's mildew.  It doesn't seem damp on this side of the door.
*Maouelue pushes on the door and tries to open it.*
It's hard to push initially.  All three of the group give it a go, and with a scraping, the door eases inward.  A short hallway opens into what looks like a green room.  Literally, the entire room is green with mildew and lichen, decay and rot and filth.
There is a large bowl in the center of the room, also covered in green mold.  (This whole floor works as difficult terrain, which means your speed per round is halved.)

As you ease in further to the room you see six symmetrical doors.  One on the W and E walls, two on the N and S walls.
*Maouelue extends a ghostly hand out into the middle of the room to try  and pick up the bowl to retrieve it.*
The bowl is larger than the hand, and is covered in a slippery green slime...  (Strength check with advantage, please!)

The mage hand lifts the bowl and brings it to the wizard.
*The hand sets it down in the previous room just outside the door to the right. Maouelue directs the hand to wipe away the slime. Dieter tries to determine what the bowl is made of.*
The hand moves over the bowl, wiping slime and muck away.  It starts scooping out the inside as well, you see ashes coming out along with the slime.  The slime comes off, but there is still a greenish residue left after the muck is wiped completely off.
*Dieter guides his flame over gently singeing a small patch of the residue, trying to break through and see the material.*
Small patches of bronze can be seen under patches of the green oxidization.
*Dieter continues to burn away what he can while the hand wipes away the char and polishes the bowl. Maouelue looks for any kind of marking.*
No special markings adorn the bowl.  The polishing reveals a bronze brazier.



*Dieter places his flame in the brazier and Maouelue directs the hand to pick it up and float ahead as they walk. They turn back out of the gross room and over to the East door, once again trying to open it.*
Loaded and saved data for Briffo Lightfoot!

(For ease of convenience -)
The party try both E doors.  The E door from the entry way leads to the main foyer with the staircase to the strange door.  The E door from the 'green' room leads to the art gallery.
*The party heads out to the front door and tries to exit the building. Briffo needs a hot minute to chill.*
The party is set to leave. As they approach the large double doors, they hear a hissing from just outside them.
*The two magic users flank the inside of the door.*
Briffo nods, puts on the ring, and his invisible self starts to open the door slowly.   (Stealth check from everybody!)



The hissing stops abruptly.  The door, pushed by the invisible halfling, continues to open.
*Maouelue whispers for Briffo to sneak behind the snake then prepares a frosty ball. Dieter prepares a sneak attack.*
Maouelue whispers to Briffo.  And in that instant, the wizard sees a giant snake's head rear up from beyond the doorway.  It opens it's mouth, bares it's fangs silently.  With a hiss, it strikes downward at Briffo...
And misses the halfling.  Must have been the luck of the little people.  Either way...

*Maouelue sends a frozen orb right at the beastâ€™s head!*






*The heroes release a song of ice and fire on the snake.*
Blow after blow rain down on the surprised snake.  He's pissed, to say the least.  He eyes the hafling again...

It wraps itself around the halfling... (Perception check for Briffo.)






Briffo tries to break the grapplr but can't.


The snake brings it's tail back, with Briffo still constricted, still struggling to get free.  In one motion, the giant brute *hurls* the halfling towards Maouelue!
