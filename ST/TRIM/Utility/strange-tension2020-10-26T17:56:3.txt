strange-tension*The group is harrowed. Seriously, that almost got the best of all of them. They need to consider carefully how to get some rest...*
*The wizard has a thought. It's crazy, but it's a thought...*
*The group rabbles a bit, but then consents to the slapdash plan, feeling rest, warmth from the fire, and food are too good of a deal to pass up.*
















*The adventurers feel the tension strangely slipping away as they break bread and regale each other with their feelings about the last battle. It's quite a merry band by the end of the rest. Their spirits are in much higher order now that they've been replenished. And now, they begin to think about a way out...and loot. They love loot.*
The longsword is called 'The Blade of the Mists', +1 longsword.  Contains 2 charges, Misty Step.  After you make a successful hit, you can cast as a bonus action.
The bracers are 'Bracers of the Giantess'; Once per day you can slam the bracers together and cast *Enlarge* on yourself.
The plate helm is the 'Frostbitten Helm'; grants wearer resistance to cold damage.
The silver ring inset with rubies in the form of an x or + is the 'Ring of Aid'; Once per day you can activate it to give the wearer 1d6 healing at the beginning of their turn.  Or, out of combat, can heal from 1d6 to 1d36 points of healing - basically 6 charges of 1d6 healing.

*As the last of the ice melts around the cavern, Maouelue looks up at the crew and is impressed by their clout. They look like a band ready to take action. Although it is getting late, they have one more push in them before turning in for a longer rest. Maouelue creates another ice bridge and the crew heads back to the NE tunnel.*
*Frenchy raises a finger to his lips, then kisses the legendary ring Dieter just let him borrow then immediately disappears. He heads further down the tunnel to scout it out, unseen.*
*As Frenchy heads off, Dieter notices Stenchy still looking a bit the worse for wear and hands him a red bottle to quaff.*

The party gathers their things from the respite, Frenchy heads off further down the tunnel.  (Perception for everyone except Frenchy.)
The henchman goes invisible and searches the path.  The green light has faded, as has all of the torchlight from the interior of the cave.  It is pitch black down the tunnel.  About forty feet in, Frenchy bangs his toes on the wall of the cave as the direction moves from NE to due E.




*Frenchy runs back to the group and tells them he can't see a damn thing. He asks them to follow and have Stenchy hold a torch in the vanguard while he stays invisible and scouts at the edge of the light range.*
The group moves together along the NE tunnel.  Frenchy sees much better now, noticing that after forty or so feet, the tunnel takes a turn due E.  The light shines forty feet in advance of the party, dimming at the edge of that distance.  The tunnel continues straight.
The party starts noticing that the tunnel looks carved out of the clay heavy soil.  It is ten feet high, a little less than ten feet wide.  The walls look damp but not wet.  A heavy smell of earth hangs everywhere.  Along with the tang of iron, but that could be from your bloodstained clothes...
The silence is the worst part.  Sounds echo, every footfall, even though they're quiet, sound like a heavily laden *thump* as you all walk.  Stenchy sounds like a bucket of silverware jouncing around.
*Maouelue winces at each echoing step, but there's not much for it at this point. He makes a palms down gesture to Stenchy trying to get him to lighten his footsteps. Stenchy makes a show of understanding and doing so, but it does almost nothing to change the clatter.*
*Dieter tells Maouelue and Stenchy to hold for a moment and takes the torch from Stenchy, moving forward along the passage with Frenchy to scout a bit more stealthily.*
As the two proceed stealthily up the tunnel, they come to a bisection in the path.  One tunnel goes NE, the other SE.


*Maouelue is keen to keep track of the crew while they wait, maintaining their stealth. He re-summons his spirit bat to keep track of the scouts.*


*On second thought, there's no time for that nonsense. Maouelue slowly leads the fighter forward with his elf vision making sure to stay well behind any sign of the light from their companions.*
*Dieter makes a mark in the ground with his staff pointing down the SE corridor and moves forward with Frenchy. They hear some plated footfalls distantly behind them and get a sense of what's going on.*
The pair travel down the path, cautiously looking around, taking in everything.  
(Perception check from both, please!)



As Frenchy moves his foot slowly down the path, he feels the floor... change.  It is raised in this part.  Not significantly, but enough for him to feel it under his boot.  He puts a hand out to stop Dieter from passing him.
*Frenchy stoops down to inspect the change in the floor and beckons Dieter to do the same.*
