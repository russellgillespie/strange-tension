strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue knocks out the wererat and tries to listen out for any hidden movement.  His keen elven ears don't pick up anything, however.   (Did you want to move at all?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage searches around the room for something that would work as a binding. A spare bit of rope...something!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are scraps here and there that could be tied together.  Or vines from the baobab tree would work.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue grabs a few vines and brings them over to the sleeping wererat, binding her up then dragging her to the precipice of the fall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue starts to tie up the wererat...  when...</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A shot of flame burst at you from through the open doorway.  The mage still can't be seen, however.  </p><p>A disembodied voice says, "I'd rather hate to leave my hard work.  Any maybe I can add a second minion to my toils tonight, too!"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes, i bet you would like that...”</p><p></p><p><i>Maouelue throws caution to the wind, leaping out toward the source of the fireball. As he flies through the air, he slams his bracers together!</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The metal man grows exponentially while flying through the air at the invisible mage.  (Acrobatics check to see if you hit/grapple him.  DC 13-17 you hit him for 1d6, DC18+ you tackle him for the 1d6 and he's grappled.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue jumps at the opening and, although he doesn't get the mage, he does some <i>major</i> damage to the surrounding room.  More of the structure comes down around the three.  (Strength save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The walls fall in, you hear an <i>oof</i> as stone cascades down and lands a blow to the mage.  The wererat, unconscious, can't help but be buried beneath the column of rock that falls in on her.  A pool of blood seeps from underneath the fallen rubble.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You ignorant OAF!  I'll have to start <i>all over again</i>!  And guess who'll be my next subject!!"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"You dare use my own spells against me?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he's sending out the missiles, something goes wrong.  The mage becomes visible again and only one missile fires off.  His eyes go wide as he knows his doom is at hand...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue lowers his visored visage and lets out a low growl</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You don't want to kill me!  I can give you information!  I can help you find your friend!  I... I..."</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage's face is turning blue, his hands scrabble at your gauntlets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue paws through the mage's dingy robes with a heavy hand.  He finds a small crystal ball with a rat skull inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"NNNGGGKKLL!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He quickly stows the ball.</i></p><p></p><p>"I can't hear you."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He squeezes harder and tilts his head as he waits for the mage to lose consciousness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hue goes a darker shade.  The mage's eyes roll back.  He goes limp.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue quickly begins binding the mage with the vines he pulled previously, or more if those are covered. He checks over the man's pockets as he does, then brings him over to the precipice.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vines are still available.  The tree and the scar are still there.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks around for a stray feather or bit of down that stray birds might have left about while hunting the small rodents in the area.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is a mess, at the the W and NW sides.  The hallway beyond is rubble-strewn as well.  Out on the grounds, though, Maouelue finds what he's looking for.  (Take your pick, too.  There should be some of that near/in trees or in bushes or just lying on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He picks up a handful of feathers and stows them alongside his sand pouch, keeping one in reserve. He then drags the mage by a bit of vine he has left hanging from the binding. He throws the mage down the hole in the ground and as the body begins to fall, he whispers a few flowing words to the feather, which shoots out and flies under the falling man!</i></p></div>
