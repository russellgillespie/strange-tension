strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The wardrobe swings open easily.  The furs are still on the floor of the cabinet.  The man is gone.  On the back wall, just as the previous cloth was hanging by a bolt, you see a piece of parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On it, a large ink dot can be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s form wavers for a moment, his shirt seems to stretch as his body swells slightly. He lets out a furious ROAR before shrinking back down to size again. He takes the bolt and parchment down and tucks them in his pack, then looks about the room and wardrobe again searching for any trace left by someone who could have set this man free. Surely the man could not have escaped without aid...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In his rage, he searches through the area, trying to find any semblance of how the man could have left or who could have been sneaky enough to pull of the heist.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A green glow surrounds him as he peers into nooks and crannies, checks for footprints or markings, and tries to piece together the events of the man's escape.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a blinding mental flash, Dieter sees a hand drawing the spot on the piece of paper, hands clothed in dark gloves.  You see thin boots, well crafted, Eleven made, stepping lightly over everything, not making any prints.  Whispers of speech come to you, but are immediately hushed.  The speech was common, but the words you cannot hear.  There is a surge of magic as the two beings are together, then they aren't in the area anymore.  You feel as if a magic transportation spell was used.  But the thief didn't use a spell to get in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter gets closer to the wardrobe, hoping to find anything of use to identify these people.  And his eyes fall on a piece of parchment outside of the wardrobe.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Supply of ropes, cut to size of five feet each, 10 gold.  Order of barrels, wooden, iron banded, made to order, four foot height by three foot diameter at the middle, 25 gold. Branding iron with the lettering RM, 10 gold.  Order of potions, sleeping draughts, bought through (garbled writing), 150 gold.  Signed, Culver.  Purchaser signature, Veena.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes the bill of sale and places it alongside the other parchment in his pack. The small muscles around his eyes pulsate with fury. He then dashes out the door making haste toward the inn.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue has been tirelessly moving the party's possessions into the drawing room. As he secures the last of the silver and heads back to the burned room, he thanks Kirra and excuses her from her vigil. He takes stock of the ornate chest and the pile of rune-embossed coins. He lowers himself to the ground and folds his legs in a lotus pose and begins to meditate on the items' respective markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a good bit of salvageable materials, surprisingly, in the room.  Along with the heads of several shovels and picks, Maouelue finds a few books intact.  Both packs are remarkably still functional, with all of their belongings in them!  Some furniture is able to be fixed, and Kirra has already set to work on fixing them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard sets to meditating, visions keep intruding, and he's not sure what they mean.  Water in a stream.  A dark basement, smelling of mildew.  Creaking wood.  A funny tasting cookie.  A pretty woman in a dark hooded cloak.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then the ring of runes comes into focus, glowing orange-red in the blackness of his meditation.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another rune pops out at him in recognition.  He can now make out <i>R-NEM-R-</i>.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Delving further and further into the meditation, possibly in frustration that he cannot piece together everything at the moment, he loses the thread and the calm fades.  The visions are chased away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the wizard comes out of his trance, Dieter appears outside the burned wall, eyes agape at the scene before him. He sees the pile of rune coins and his heart skips a beat. He calls out to Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue picks up his head slowly</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter recounts the details of what he found at Culver’s and tells Maouelue about the teleportation and the bill of sale. He conveniently leaves out his mild torture of the brute.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue appears deeply concerned. He relays his proclamation to Denson about forming a guild.</i></p><p><i>Dieter considers this a moment, a bit taken aback at first, then nods.</i></p></div>
