strange-tension*Maouelue doesn't speak publicly about his relationship with his master. It had been a long time since that day in the library tower, and the shock and gravity of the task lain before him was difficult to express. Yet he poured his love and devotion to Shi'Vandos into everything he did, and this task was no different. It had been a long time since the mage had come across any clue pointing him in the direction of his charge, and the elf often needed to attend to more mundane tasks in order to sustain himself and make means to carry on the search. 

So it was with this adventure he found himself in now. One job. One lost miner. Lord...how pear-shaped it had all gone. Yet, he wouldn't trade what he had now found for the lost time...

No indeed. He was more found now than ever. He hoped this newfound vigor would lead him once more to the path!*

(hahaha, I didn't take as much time as I could have with the trimming, but it gets the job done

*During their long toiling work building the staircase, the two adventurers combed the caverns quite a bit. One day they went over to inspect the giant rift they had been avoiding. It was time to take a closer look...*


After the toiling work of the forge, the two men decide to take a break and discover the mysterious chasm.  As they travel through the hallway,  the rift blooms into view.  Darkness swells both above and below.  A small sliver of light can be seen far above them, below is complete blackness.  There is a small walkway that meanders both north and south, clinging precariously to what now looks like the edge of a massive stone edifice.  Bats flit about, not threatening the group.  There are some other flying animals mixed in with them, slightly larger, but nothing is posing a threat at the moment.
*Maouelue considers the chasm a moment, then begins to concentrate. Dieter can an ethereal form beginning to coalesce up in the swarm of bats. After a few moments, he understands and looks to back to the mage, now fully in the midst of his ritual. He keeps an eye out for the time being while the familiar descends and binds to Maouleue.*
*After an hour of this, the wizard comes to and blinks twice at the bat which then immediately zooms upward toward the light above piercing the dark.*
*He attends a report, telepathic or otherwise about how high it is and what lies above. Should there be any means escalating this slope, the wizard would ask to know of it.*
The bat flies... flies... flies...  At the edge of it's telepathic link, it relays to the wizard all it can see. The opening is getting closer, looks to be a scar-shaped gash in the world.  At best guess, before the bond breaks, it's maybe 200ft above the two.
*Maouelue instructs the bat to fly up to the surface then come back down and report.*
As it comes back into range it receives the signal and follows out the commands.  Several minutes pass as the other animals seem riled by something, they flutter upwards rapidly and perch, suspended from the ceiling, tens of feet above.  A small rumble can be heard, very faintly, to the N, and from below.  

Maouelue's new bat familiar returns and reports.  The cavern is extremely vast, the opening is 180ft above.  It is an entrance gouged into what seems to Maouelue as a barrow of sorts.  Ruined stone walls surround an altar or pedestal.  The room appeared to be unused for quite some time as the bat reports detritus all over.
*Dieter takes note of the rumble and takes a cursory peek at the source of the sound.*
The bat does not see any safe way down.  There are ledges and areas cut away from and into the rocks, naturally as far as it can tell, where the two would be able to stand and walk safely.  Getting to those spots could be treacherous.

Dieter can't quite tell what it is.  Sounds big, though.
*The two start heading back toward the forge.*





*Maouelue understands the bat's disdain, but...that's what familiars are for to an extent...He'd give it a spectral spider as a snack a bit later...*
*Dieter tugs at Maouelue's arm as they walk back toward the forge.*
"I've got a plan...It's crazy...but it's a plan...."
*As the two return to their construction, Dieter tells Maouelue about his plan and what they might want to prepare for the way. The wizard shakes his head and lets out a chortle of impressed, and a bit flabbergasted, approval.*
*They tinker at the forge, trying out new things; and in all reality, each thing was new as they went. The spoke at length about what they had seen Saynea do back at her anvil in Oakhurst and tried to emulate her movements. The way she had brace and shaped the red hot metal. They wondered what she had made of their boon of silver, if anything since they had set out...

...dear how long had it been...? The time seemed endless in these halls with only the light from the forge and what they provided giving note. Thus the two would venture over to and from the crevasse to note the timing of the light from above, the better to track their days with.*
