<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage turns back to the doorway, determined.  He's getting a much better look now, and can clearly see that there is a magical essence to the barrier.  The hawk screeches below, Daran yells something Maouelue can't quite make out.  He reaches out a hand to the veil.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just as his hand is about to touch the haze, the shimmering lifts, dissipates, disappears.   Behind it is a dark room.  Gone are the books, the library.  A spiral staircase can be seen with a little landing just beyond the doorway.  Standing on the landing is an old elven man.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Doctor Lanrion, I presume?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Long white hair pours from his head and face, making him look ancient for an elf.  His skin has a dusky pallor, a few liver spots dotting his face.  His back is slightly hunched. He's grasping a clear crystal staff tightly with both hands.  His mouth chews on something.  He looks frustrated, but curious too.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a voice like the opening of a dusty, ancient tome, he says, "I have never been called Doctor before, lad.  A moniker I quite enjoy, actually.  Quite a feat of athleticism, getting up on my balcony.  Why didn't you just knock?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“‘‘Tis for the thrush to knock upon the door. That of the Metal Mage marks many mirrored masks.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old wizened wizard contemplates for a moment.  He smiles, and says, "We can always learn a thing or two from nature.  Even thrushes.  Come.  The tea is getting cold."  And he walks down the circular stairs, inside the his tower.</p><p></p><p>(Gonna pause it there for tonight, my good sir.  I'm loving where this is going, by the way.  I know it's a bit slower than the fight scenes, but it's so much fun to rp with all of these folks!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old elven man makes his way slowly down the spiral stairs.  At the bottom, a small table is set with seven seats and a pot of steaming tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard reaches the bottom of the tower, the staircase rising seemingly to infinity above the two of you, he approaches the side wall and places a gnarled hand on it.  A doorway appears and opens outward, admitting the rest of the group.  They start cautiously coming in as Lanrion starts pouring tea for everyone.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue smiles kindly at their bewildered faces. “Come friends, let us take our tea with the host of this tower. Master Lanrion, though, <i>Doctor Lanrion</i> is fast catching on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard chuckles as he pours more cups.  "<i>I</i> would like it, yes.  But patrons might not when they realize I cannot help them with their common colds, or various afflictions.  That is, I cannot help them... without magic."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He finishes, offers the seats with a wave, and places the pot in the air behind him.  It vanishes as he sits and says, "So, what brings your fine company to an old man's door today?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well good wizard, there are long and short answers to that question. I’ll begin with the latter. I was told that your enchanting services are unparalleled and if I wanted to ‘go big’ as it were, that this was the place to come. As you no doubt have noticed, I am a bit more metallic than other arcanists you may have come across. However, I lack a bit of...covering in a key area. I’ve commissioned a set of platinum greaves, in reverence of my patron...I seek to have them imbued with a balance of strength and intelligence, for that lust which drives one in battle must be tempered by a cool head.” He cannot help but flick his eyes over to Bellatrix during this last. “The long answer, perhaps my company here can help to elaborate, but let us say, that if you were to render these services, your help would be felt a great deal beyond just those you see here today, for there are powers afoot that all who claim to be agents of good would do well to refute.”</p></div>
