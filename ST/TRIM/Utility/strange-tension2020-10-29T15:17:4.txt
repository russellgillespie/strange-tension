<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is the first to recover his wits and gestures for calm. The party, slightly crestfallen, obliges. They take stock of the scene and a mild guilt forms in their diaphragms. It's all of a mess. What could the Muhlens possibly be doing down here? The group moves to a small outcropping they saw near the entrance and sits down to make camp and recover their strength.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Stenchy's had a tough day.  Although he found some good gear, fighting in it, wearing it, using the new magical items...  it has taken a toll on the big man.  He's tired.  And as his head nods down... down... down... As his friends sleep blissfully innocent dreams of treasures to come and mysteries to solve...  There is a hiss of something thrown in the air at the group.  (Give me a d4 roll.  Dieter 1, Frenchy 2, Maouelue 3, Stenchy 4)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The javelin hits Stenchy <i>hard</i> in the chest plate, doing 6 points of damage.
