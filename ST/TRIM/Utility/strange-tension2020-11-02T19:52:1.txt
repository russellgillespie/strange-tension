strange-tension*Maouelue moves in and inspects the coffin looking for any sign of a name or message.*
No name or message.  Looks to Maouelue like a pauper's coffin.
The wood is distressed in places, splintering here and there.
*He beckons Dieter to help him lift the lid.*
The lid is nailed down, but the wood is so old the nails don't catch like they once did.  The wizard and the druid are able to get their fingers into crevices and *pull* up.  The lid lifts off, revealing a clay statue of a snake-warrior, arms crossed over their chest.  A clay depiction of a scimitar is as if it were in the warrior's hip scabbard.  The eyes are gold bits, but they look too small to be standard currency gold pieces.
*They lower the lid back down and move across the hall to the opposite door for a similar inspection.*
You find the exact same thing.
*Sensing the pattern, the group moves to the back right room.*
This is a larger room that the last, the archway has some words written in snake-ese.  The door pulls open to reveal a coffin, slightly smaller that the other two.  There are reliefs on the walls depicting snake-men using magic.
*The two magic users slow and take their time inspecting the reliefs, carefully examining the magical effects being represented.*
The depictions are of destruction magics, vile and ancient.
*Maouelue takes out his sketchbook and begins drawing a facsimile of the two murals. While the wizard draws his strokes, Dieter has Frumious assist him with the next coffin lid.*
This statue is smaller and is clothed in what used to be fancy purple robes.  Tatters remain.  The hands are crossed and there is a silver ring on the hand resting on top.
*Dieter steps back, considering this a moment while he pulls out a red bottle and pulls the cork with this canines, spitting it into the corner. He lets out a sneering hiss at the statue as he pulls back and lowers the contents down his gullet, wincing slightly and shaking his neck and shoulders.*
*Still not quite feeling up to his normal vigor, he shudders and whispers a few additional words of healing.*

*A rough grunt escapes the druid, a hint of a growl still on his voice.*
*As Maouelue flits around inspecting the finer points of shadow and highlight, his eye is drawn to the silver ring. He sets his drawing down in his pack and moves to it, hovering his palm over it feeling for traces of the arcane.*


"Oh Bahamut...guide me in my search."
As the wizard waves his hand and checks for traces of the arcane, a voice utters deep in his mind.  He cannot understand the words, but they are foreboding, menacing.  Guttural grunts mixed with hisses echo in the man's head.  There is a whisper of common underlying everything, though.  It sounds like "weapon".
*He pulls his palm back, frowning gravely. He then waves the group to the opposite room, leaving this coffin open for the time being.*
*They proceed across the corridor.*
The room opposite is structured exactly like this one, except for a décor of magic, there is a ambiance of learning and scholar here.  There is a small bookshelf in the corner, all of the items are withered to dust though.  The coffin opens on a smallish serpent-scholar, bedecked in tattered robes of deep blue and silver.
*Maouelue bends in closer to the serpent scholar looking for any symbols of devotion or knowledge that might have been lain with the form.*

*Dieter's professional curiosity is stoked as well.*

*The two blink at each other simultaneously.*
There is a serpent eating it's own tail, but there seems to be something else about that symbol.  Neither of you can tell what's odd about it, though.  (Religion check for more info on the symbol)


*Maouleue takes the point of his blade and begins slicing out the symbol, the tucks it into his book.*
The druid thinks back over his many years of observance for his religion.  Nothing stands out directly, but something about a long-lost or ousted serpentine race once idolized the symbol nags the back of his mind.  Nothing specific comes together for either of the men.

*With great care Maouelue slices a thin layer of the clay placing it in between the pages of his diary and closing it hard. He walks back across the hallway and begins to skewer the ring on the tip of his sword.*
*Dieter stands back half amused, half sickened at the sound of echoing metal.*
*It’s quite a scene to see such a fearsomely clad being taking such gentle care of these idols.*
*He leans back and pops another bottle of red.*


The finger comes off along with the ring.  The clay statue was hollow and filled with a poisonous gas.  As the gas seeps out, Maouelue clocks it early and is able to jump out of the room in time.  It dissipates, only delivering one point of damage to the Dragon Mage.
The rest of the group sees a greenish haze filtering out of the room.
*Maouelue steps out of the room. Heading for the last door.*
*As Dieter sees the second bit of poison in as many encounters, he changes out his rings.*
The oaken door at the end of the hall stands imposing.
