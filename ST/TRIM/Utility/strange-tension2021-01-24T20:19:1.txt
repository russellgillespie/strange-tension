The thought floods over him, as he pursues so called forces of justice, what is he leaving in the wake? How many lost? Too many...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...Dieter...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Be strong.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The last he says aloud, an icy tear crystallizing into the crows feet developing at the corner of his eye through years of scrutiny and intense attention to detail, and well, a bit of light-hearted reverie along the way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>But the costs had never been so high as now. Thus his mission here. He must retain focus at all costs. The mission here with his half brother would have to wait. For now. It was time to fulfill their contract and the sooner he could get this bit of whimsy sorted, the better. His fingers fiddle idly with the Expeditious Retreat scroll he had been looking forward to studying.</p><p></p><p>He turns back expectantly to Lanrion and Benna.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard's eyes take on a softer, knowing cast.  Lanrion nods his head again as he picks up the ring.  "Yes.  Yes, this will do well."  He's looking at Maouelue when he says this, then sits down next to him at the tea table.  </p><p>"The thing about sacrifice is that, for it to be truly understood, truly <i>sacrificial</i>, no one can know of it.  It can't be broadcast to the heavens.  There shouldn't be grand gestures.  It often times is just people.  Going about their business, making the difficult choices.  Doing what they can as they must.  And when posed with a difficult task or decision, always choosing the harder road.  Not because it is hard, but because it is right.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The interesting thing about you and your friends is that, although you might not know it yet, your choices and actions will effect the world for years and years to come.  There are some things coming you cannot and will not change.  But, for your part, there are important, world changing things you can affect.  Just by choosing right.  For example, the reason you wear that armor.  Had you not chosen the Platinum Protector, there might be a real chance a choice in your future could be swayed another way.  I say this not to worry your, or question your allegiances.  Simply to inform you of the importance of perseverance.  And of hope.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Without the belief that what you do <i>means</i> something, even to just one person, your choices are then random, as is your effect on the warp and weft of the world.  But you, sir...  your actions mean something.  Sometimes, yes, to just one person.  And other times to people you will never get the chance to meet."  He looks sorrowfully down at the ring in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods stoically, taking in this wisdom.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes the ring and puts it round his index finger on his right hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As soon as Maouelue touches the ring, he feels different.  He can't pinpoint it, but does feel different that he had before.  </p><p></p><p>"Two more things.  One, strength and intelligence will get you far.  But, for the long road, you might find that your greatest need is a strong spine and a deeper understanding of things.</p><p></p><p>(The ring gives you +4 Wis, +2 Int, and +4 Con)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Lastly, I believe your biggest fear can be allayed with this...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lanrion waves his hand at the wall and a picture comes, crystal clear, upon it.  It is a moving picture, complete with sound.  It is of a young bearded man, of whom Maouelue is familiar with.  A gigantic snail comes up from behind him, but it looks friendly to the man.  Another man comes into the picture, dressed in common clothes.  In his hands, a specially made sword-staff.  He is looking intently at a tapestry that Maouelue can see bears a skull in a triangle setting, all on a black background.</p></div>
