strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The druid gets a few <i>pings</i> from the spell.  There is a slight aura around the chest, abjuration magic.  The egg shape on the table has a very strange aura around it, you can't really tell the school of magic, though.  The door on the curved wall has an aura of abjuration magic.  The crystals are also giving off a strange vibe.  Not so much an aura, but something about them is on the cusp of magic.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The piece of metal Dieter finds bends and almost breaks off in the locking mechanism.  He's able to retract it.  Jacob hands you a pair of lockpicks, saying, "Here, these might work a bit better, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Thanks. I’ll give em a shot!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes the lockpicks and tries his hand at the chest again.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob watches as Dieter deftly delves into the locking mechanism again.  This time, with a few quick twists of his wrists, the lock <i>clicks</i> open, the latch kicks open in a rush.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A strange beating starts coming from the box.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob grabs his head, and immediately falls unconscious, slipping from the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a strange clicking mixed in with the beating now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter dives away to pick up Jaecob and pull him to the relative safety of a tent, watching the chest through the flap with a dreadful anticipation.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't tell what is wrong with Jaecob, but he infers that it's probably due to the unlocking of the chest.  The golden boon strands closed, with the beating and clicking still emanating from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes out his crossbow and fires a bolt a the lid of the chest trying to pry open the top from afar by pushing it up against its hinges.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A few things happen simultaneously.  First, Dieter notices the top to the chest <i>bump</i> up.  Second, the druid hears a choking cough come from Jaecob.  Lastly, he sees the bolt <i>thunk</i> into the top of the chest, and it flies open...  revealing...</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>OB1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (14) + 3 = <code>17</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The slime <i>flops</i> out of the chest with a sickening squelch.  An almost humanoid form appears within it as it sloughs its way down the steps towards Dieter and Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>FL1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (17) - 3 = <code>14</code>.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sends out a blast of flame, then picks out a wilting shamrock from his pack and hums an Old Irish Blessing to his bladestaff.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli schlurps over to the ooze and makes a large “Beeeeeaaalk” noise then hits out with her remaining tentacles.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The green slime is now glowing, wreathed in flames.  The humanoid figure's eyes are clouded, but it looks furious.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The green goo attaches onto a stalk of Shelli's and Dieter sees the snail shudder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brings the fury of the wind blowing through the dunegrass onto the Ooze's head(?) splattering bits of goo everywhere. Startled by her extra gooey stalks, she flails out wildly, battering the Ooze into a pulp even after it capitulates still swinging.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Splatt</i> The goo splits all over the floor, splattering the tiles and tents with a green sheen.  The clicking and beating are louder now, coming from the golden box under the altar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes note of the increased volume coming from the altar, but turns instead to Frume, taking note of his condition and trying to bring him around.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob is unconscious but stable, he's suffering from some magical effect that is not arcane nor deific.  It's unlike anything you've seen before... expect when checking on the crystals.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter considers this then brings a few of the crystals over placing three in a circle around Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes 1 point of damage as he touches the crystals.  Suddenly, the voices start up again.</p><p>"Tie this off, quickly..."</p><p>"HOW could they just disappear?..."</p><p>"... Should be ready now...."</p><p>"...Pretty sure I won that last one..."</p><p>"Brains...  BRAINS..."</p><p>"There is no way out!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid brings the glowing crystals closer to Jaecob, Muhlen starts twitching and going into seizures.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter quickly hurries the crystals away to the opposite side of the room, taking note of their strange properties. The connection to these voices seems important, but he’s not sure how much more he can take. He rushes back over to Jaecob to check on his condition.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pours a bit of water from his skin onto Jaecob’s forehead.</p></div>
