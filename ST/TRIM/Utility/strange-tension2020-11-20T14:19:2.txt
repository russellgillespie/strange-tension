strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter taps into a deep pool of druidic knowledge.  Warm humming stems from him and echoes around the cavern, casting harmonics everywhere.  A crescendo of sound, positive radiant energy is visible as golden and green sparkle motes in the air.  The bats take flight moments before Dieter thrusts the Baobab staff into the ground.  </p><p></p><p>At first, nothing happens.  Then, the gold and green motes seem to be sucked into the staff, giving it a glow that nearly blinds the two heroes.  Dieter yells to his friend to stand back just as roots erupt from the bottom of the staff, growing directly into the soil of the cavern wall.  Thick shoots start emanating from the staffs top, and the width of the staff starts to grow.  Second by second the staff adds more boughs.  The staff turns into a massive tree growing from the side of the cavern wall.  Vines have knotted themselves up the side of the tree to make a makeshift walkway/ladder the men can use to climb up.  With a final <i>creak</i>, the tree finishes its growth, a tuft of leaves blotting out the sunlight at the top of the rift.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two then tighten their pack straps and start to make their way up the long course of thick ivy and vines with which Dieter has surrounded the tree trunk.  It’s a tough slog, but the extra footing and holds help greatly as they ascend. A glance downward shows Quenchy sitting out by the wall of the crevasse smoking a rolled cigarette and making dismissive gestures.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The Frenchmen make themselves at home, picking out areas for their work, and even dismantling the trap in the hallway so they're able to move through with ease.  The climbers hear the bats flit around them, but they do no damage as one of their members is friendly to Maouelue.  All told, the trek up the tree takes some time, but the two reach the top branches and the entrance to the barrow right around sundown.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The woman sees the towering druid above, then feels a bug landing on her and sees an enormous metal man emerging from the tree/scar.

<div class="character-1"><p>The woman goes limp in Maouelue's arms.  The two move her into the recesses of the room.  Sounds start coming from outside the ruined barrow.  Many voices shouting, running feet, the sounds of steel being unsheathed.</p></div>
