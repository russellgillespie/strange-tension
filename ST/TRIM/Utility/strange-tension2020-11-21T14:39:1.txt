strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The sun is set behind the trees in the west, the haze colors the sky red.  Matching the ground around Maouelue and Dieter.  In the distance to the north, Dieter can just make out another haze.  A cloud of dust is being kicked up.  The details are hard to see, but it is probably the posse coming.  At a glance, Dieter gives it about five minutes until they breach the barrow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter quickly checks over the bodies, looking for loot and info. Maouleue does the same in the south before they rendezvous back in the barrow.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Besides the very dirty clothes and ill-kept weapons, there is a piece of parchment crumpled up and stuffed in the man's trousers.  It reads, <i>"Be on the lookout for two men answering to the names Dieter and Maouelue.  (Descriptions follow.)  These men are bandits charged with stealing from the Runemark.  5000 gold piece ransom, dead or alive."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the message and they leave the bodies. They head back into the barrow and into a corner, Dieter once again goes invisible and Maouelue throws the net over himself.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The tension (strange?) mounts as the hoofbeats get closer.  It sounds like thunder, Dieter and Maouelue try to count the number and get lost in the cacophony.   Tense minutes pass.  Finally, graciously, the thunder subsides and sounds of many feet hit the ground.  This isn't just the posse, it's the cavalry.  Steps start hitting stone, and a pair of rugged, muck-trodden boots jump in through the window, swords out and at the ready.  A familiar face scans the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Come on now, lads...  I know you've tricks.  Tell you what, I'll put one o'these away and we can discuss terms, eh?"</p><p>Frume sheaths a rapier, but holds his Giant Slayer at the ready, in a dueling pose.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p>They stay silent for the time being.<i>They stay silent for the time being.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ohhh kay, well then...  I'll start.  I fully understand I might be talking to the ether, here, but our man said you were here last.  And it's hard to miss the carnage out front there.  Sooo, here goes.  We're business men, put simply.  We would prefer your help in our ventures.  And I'd be happy to take you to the headquarters, maybe reunite with Culver?  If either of ya is still here, there's really no way to fight yer way outta here.  Just offrin' up the olive branch first, as it is."</p><p>He waits, listening and watching.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two remain silent. Surely this is a ruse...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks about a bit more.  Sheaths his other blade.  Makes a face as if to say, <i>well, okay</i>, and hollers back through the window.  </p><p>"Fan out you lot.  See if there's anything we missed.  And get those bodies buried.  Or burned.  I want reports from the team leaders before nightfall."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He steps through the window with a backwards glance.  One more scan of the area, then nods again and leaves.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sound of many people surround the barrow.  A few come and go through the room, but mostly it's left alone.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes what chance he can as the men come and go. He sidles over to where he saw Maouleue throw the net over himself.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Maouelue, you'll never go undetected with all that metal on you. I'll go rally the boys downstairs and we'll figure out a plan..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid hears a light hum, a few words, and some disembodied shuffling as the wizard does something under the net.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the wizard at his word and shuffles over to the Baobab ladder, he glances around one more time before heading down the long climb.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue goes into a meditative state while he waits, his mind going through its exercises and refreshing his spirit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two make it down the baobab ladder undetected, at least what they are able to tell.  Unaccosted, to be certain.</p></div>
