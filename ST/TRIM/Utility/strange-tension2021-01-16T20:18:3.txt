<div class="character-1"><p>Mao cuts an <i>impressive</i> visige, especially considering the gore of the battle around him.  The soldiers go from sprint to jog, then confusion as bodies lay all around them.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The army approaches you both <i>extremely</i> cautiously.  Even Bellatrix, noting the gruesome nature of the arrow-and-frost ridden goblins, worgs, and ogres, gives the both of you a wider berth.  "Ahoy, there," an eladrin yells.  "Are you Maouelue the Mage and Daran the ranger, come from the material plane?  Answer true, or there will be violence in the name of Queen Titania!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue let’s his orbs come to a rest, arranging them as verticies in an equilateral triangle surrounding his feet. As he does this, the other six coalesce into a surrounding hexagon, giving the effect of a metallic mandala with the Dragon Mage at its center. ￼</p><p></p><p>“I am one and the same. My companion and I have needed life-saving measures, both from each other and in service of your kin, having done the same for them amidst similar suspicion. It would seem your lands are overrun with darkness from beneath. It is that which both pushes and draws my company higher. Pray, I seek now violence with the Queen nor any of her <i>servants</i>. Mine and our aim together would be to shine mine and thine divine light on the roots of this evil. Would you not agree?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look at each other, searchingly.  Otirnis strides forward and, placatingly, tries to ease this strange tension.  "It is well that we found you here.  After the report from Erifias, we though you would be perished.  They send their apologies for the abrupt exit.  We are only able to use our fey transportation once in a full-day's time.  Since they used it to bring our original foursome scouting party to this woods, Erifias was unable to use it again so quickly.  Only after an intense meditation were they able to use it.  They are aware you saved their life.  Erifias was heart-broken that their plan did not work."  She crosses her left hand over her right shoulder and bows deeply to the duo.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran goes up to her and lifts her shoulders so that they are face to face.  Her breath catches as they look at each other.  With weariness exuding from him, he returns the salute.  The rest of the soldiers do the same.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix scans over the scene, and catches Maouelue's eye.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He catches her eyes and holding them in his gaze, he salutes her in the same fashion, but slowly, intentionally.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She goes to Maouelue, raises him up, and embraces him.  "I thought I lost you."  The wizard hears soft sobbing in his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Stunned, not least by her her show of strength to lift him fully clad, Maouelue lets out a great gasp that turns into a laugh before fading to him softly saying, “No, no, no...I’m still here. And I’m glad you’re here with me Bella.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, looks down at the ground sheepishly, and says, "I.. I raised a circle of hell when they teleported us and wouldn't bring me back right away."  She looks around, "Seems you did fine by yourselves, though, aye?"  A little brogue comes out, which hadn't been there before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Not completely certain she didn’t raise an <i>actual</i> circle of hell, he replies, “Your wonders never cease milady...” A pregnant pause and then he adds quietly, “I look forward to our private conversation.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As do I."  </p><p>Otirnis comes over with a medicine kit, checking over Daran and Mao.  Several others are scouring the forest for remnants and spoils of the battle.   Finally, when all is done, Otirinis says, "It is time to go.  Are you all ready?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue starts at the sound of Otirnis’ voice and moves back into a less familiar position with Bellatrix. “Yes, ah...indeed. Indeed we are Ortinis.” He flashes one more glance back at Bella, not quite able to comply contain his broadening smile.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets off with the others, not entirely sure if it’s his new boots or something else making him feel like he could jump three times his usual height. </p><p></p><p><i>I’ll have to test that out soon...</i></p></div>
