strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>There's not much Maouelue can tell, he can't really get at the wound properly without taking off Douglas's tunic.  Moving him in this condition might be difficult and problematic.  You can tell, however, that his breathing is very shallow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He's panicking a bit now. He tells Frenchy to keep Douglas stable, then runs headlong into the tavern.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks around for anyone who might help.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy does the best he can to staunch the bleeding, but there's no way for him to know if he's helping or hurting.  The wizard looks around, sees the barkeep sweeping inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He licks his lips and looks at you.  "Look at this place, will you?  I try to run a clean and honorable establishment, and you folks breeze into town, make havoc, and are carried out as heroes.  Leaving <i>me</i> to clean up the mess.  Just like always.  Adventurers.  Bah!"</p><p></p><p>He takes a beat, looks at the distress in Maouelue's face, and says, "Probably nothing a bandage and a good night's sleep won't fix.  But if you must, there is a priest of Ilmater at the parsonage down the way." (He points Northeast of town.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue storms out of the bar, losing control a bit, he works with Frenchy to load Douglas into the cart as gently as possible. They make as much haste as they can while trying to keep the cart steady and head off toward the parsonage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you travel down the road, nearing the dead of night, the events of the day seem to be getting to you.  You're feeling very tired and in need of sleep...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three travelers make their way to a run-down shack at the edge of town.  Nothing denotes it as a shrine, no symbols or totems decry it's patron.  A small woman sits out front, legs dangling off of a bench.  Her head is bowed, her hands clasped in her lap, fingers moving slightly over a simple metal item.  She is clothed in simple brown robes, with only a sash to designate her as an acolyte of Ilmater, the patron diety of suffering and sacrifice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, staggering with exhaustion, shoves the cart a few feet away from the woman.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Without a word, the woman jumps down from the bench and comes to you.  Her smile is warm, her mere presence is soothing to you, calming you instantly.  She touches Maoulue on the arm, and a warmth spreads from her touch all the way through his body, bringing clarity and peace to the overwhelmed wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue lets out a large breath he didn't realize he was holding.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Silently she turns to the cart.  She peers in and her countenance changes to that of pity.  It's as if this hurt man, his pain, is causing her pain.  She reaches down to touch Douglas, her hands starting to stain red from his blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A yellow-gold glow starts emanating from her hands.  Seconds later, Douglas gasps, his breathing regulates, yet he does not come fully awake.   The glow recedes and she turns back to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He's very weak.  We have no full bedding here, but there are bedrolls inside.  Would you like him to stay here so I can look after him?"  He voice is soft, musical, and... sad.  Yet her smile has not faded an inch, even when she looked on Douglas with pity.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course.  And you both are welcome to stay here with him, if you'd like.  Pardon my not mentioning before.  Ilmater's house is always available."  She bows to you, and starts to attempt to move the man in the cart.  She's about as tall as it, though, so it's proving a bit... awkward.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the Frenchman's help, Douglas is brought inside and ministered to by the small woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's eyelids begin to close against his will. Only when he sees his man laid down do they finally shut, casting his mind into an unsettled darkness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Cut to Culver's</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, seeing his companion trod off toward the tavern, slowly closes the door and turns to the bound man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He kicks him roughly in the ribs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood spurts out of the man's mouth as he comes back to a hazy consciousness.  Looking around through swollen eyes, he sees Dieter and starts to laugh.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Wracking, hacking coughs cut in, followed by more laughing.  He picks his head up and looks around.  He seems to recognize the place, even by the darkened interior, and starts guffawing, hacking, laughing, retching.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When he calms down, breathing heavy, he whispers something Dieter doesn't catch.</p></div>
