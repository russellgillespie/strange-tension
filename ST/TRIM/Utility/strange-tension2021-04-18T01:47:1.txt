<div class="character-0"><p>"Please then, give us this boon. We ask in the name of Albrek."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He narrows his eyes, eventually nodding and closing them.  He raises his hands at the Dragon Mage, a gold glow surrounds Maouelue...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, and you'll find three pairs of boots outside the room."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We are most grateful for these gifts. On the edge of a knife, it helps to keep one's balance. May our mutual ends be met with such true aim."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I would suggest putting the boots on before your long rests.  You can attune to them properly that way.  Also, I know you ladies have not had a proper rest.  Here.  Take this and be well."  Aeneir gives the women a glass of something.  "I'll just be writing here at my desk.  Please rest, and let me know if you require anything else."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, we will take rest here and plan for the trials ahead. Thank you Æneìr. May this be the beginning of a new era here at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group takes the rest, getting things together, planning for the next steps of the mission.  The liquid in the glasses that the ladies drank healed their exhaustion and let their short rest work as a long rest.  Everyone has new boots, and before long, everyone is ready to trek out.  (Anything you'd like to do or discuss in the interim?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray, before we go, I would ask of you one more thing. Would it be too much to ask for a handwritten spell scroll, something of your design. I am first and foremost a scholar, and should I...we make it out of here alive, I would be honored to add another page in your history back at our academy."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir's back is to the group, writing at his desk.  Maouelue sees his shoulders briefly raise a couple times, and he turns in his chair rolling up a piece of parchment. </p><p></p><p>"Great minds, and all that," he says as he hands the rolled up parchment to the mage.  </p><p></p><p>As Maouelue grabs it, Aenier holds on to it for a beat, not letting it go.  "It will only open when the time is right.  This is the most powerful magic I know.  Follow your path, seek to do what is right.  And your group will see days upon days."  He smiles and releases the scroll.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue bows reverently and accepts the scroll with two upturned hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Aeneir leads the trio back out of the room, into the hall and past a couple more closed doors until they reach a hallway moving south and grading up.  "Take this way through the mountain.  It will twist and lead up, eventually ending in a door.  This will lead you to the lowest level of the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  Good luck, and may the gods bless you all."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks deep into Æneìr’s eyes and sees the countless ages told there in every freckle of the iris, the darkest depth of his pupils. </p><p></p><p>“Until we meet again, Master Æneìr.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They walk on down the hall</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Below the writing, carved in the ice, is a dragon mark.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage casts a couple of furtive sideways glances at the sisters and moves closer to investigate the sigil more closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dragon mark looks to be a signature, the same as the one on the giant gate below.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a hallway with stairs leading down to the south; all of the steps and walkways seem to be either ice blocks or stone iced-over stone.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Are everyone’s boots secure? Come, follow me as far as this the place will allow.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads them South down the corridor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women nod quietly to Maouelue and follow.  Thirty feet S the hall opens up on the left (E) into a large, circular room.  In the center is another large brick of solid ice, but there looks to be something inside of this one.  It's in the center of the room, on a small island connected to the outer walkway by a wooden bridge.  The water around it sloshes as if there was a current or something underneath the surface causing it to move with a current.  The room is lined with bookshelves, completely filled to the brim. They all are iced in place, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are three halls branching from the outer circle - two to the NE, one directly S.</p></div>
