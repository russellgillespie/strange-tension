strange-tension<div class="character-1"><p>The table Daran overheard is eyeing all of your group <i>hard</i>.  Not in an overly menacing way at all, just extremely curious and being very obvious about it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are five people in all, four men and a woman.  All look to be either spring eladrin or run-of-the-mill elves.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue leans over to one of his handlers and mentions as much, asking whether these folks are known to the palace guard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one eating checks what Maouelue says, but is very careful not to give away too much.  With a boisterous yell and a flamboyant show, he pours more wine for everyone, getting up and offering his seat to the older sister.  Who sits in it with a giggle/cackle.  A gackle, if you will.  As the guard moves around the table, filling drinks, his eyes move deftly over the group.  He pulls a chair out at a nearby empty table for Bellatrix, then sits himself opposite, directly behind Maouelue.  Without a beat, the wizard hears behind him in a low whisper, "The woman is Tinebrae, works at a seedier tavern by the docks.  The husky one is Maradeim, the blonde one is Tannivh.  Both work in warehouses by the docks.  The other two I don't know.  Do you require something from them, lord wizard?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Fill them a round of the wine and send my blessings."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The... ah...  the Elverquisst, my lord?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Astonished, the guard nods and goes to find the waiter.  Moments later, a yell comes up from the other table as the wine is presented and the waiter explains the table's good fortune.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue raises his glass and catches their eyes, in a pantomime toast.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men are pretty inebriated already, but the woman eyes Maouelue cautiously.  She turns to her group, says something, and the rest of them scoff, raising their glasses high and enjoying the present.  The woman, frustrated, folds her arms and stews.  She continues to look back and forth, secretively, between the two tables.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The magnanimous metal mage meanders over to the meddling meetup he's monitoring.</p><p>"Fine day my fellow! Enjoy the wine, I did not want our revelry to encroach upon your table's experience negatively." At these last words he looks hard at the frowning woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men speak up at once, jumping up and patting Maouelue on the back, offering him a seat.  </p><p>"Hey now, lad!"</p><p>"Thank you for the vintage!"</p><p>"For the heart of the city!" </p><p>"To the Queen and King!"</p><p>"Long live the Court!"</p><p>Their exuberance is caught by other tables, and the revelry heightens. </p><p>The dour woman gives Maouelue a half-smile.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come now, let us have a song in memory of this moment!" Maouelue looks around for some of the attending musicians and calls for a Fey ley to be sung by all.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A fresh-faced bard gets shoved towards the group.  He has a hand harp.  That's slightly out of tune.  The heckles start right away from the group of dock workers.  The bard, sheepishly, starts playing an ode to the day.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although nervous, he plays decently, if a bit blandly.  The story is of heroes on a mighty quest searching for the lost elven bow of The Prince of Frost.  One of the dock workers boo him and ask if anyone knows about the tale of the Dôlgubalak.  The woman slaps the man in the shoulder, hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She whispers something acidically under her breath.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dôlgubalak you say? Aye let's hear that but after! I'm a sucker for a frosty Elven bow, I must confess."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bard stammers and balks, the harp twangs reluctantly.  The boos increase, but at the encouragement of Maouelue, people pipe down and pay attention to the story.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Unfortunately it's a meandering mish-mash of love story and romance novelette, a juvenile sordid tale.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something about it being buried with his true love.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue tries to hear what the woman says, but just misses it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks pretty mad though.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The fresh elf finishes his song to a smattering of applause.  A super fan yells behind him somewhere, and he bows off, blushing.</p></div>
