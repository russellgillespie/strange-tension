<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter watches as the water washes over the 'drow'.  A few fade away into nothingness, then they turn to the red ooze again.  It merges into the other forms, making the others grow larger.  Three very muscled drow now look down at you and smile.  As one, in a grating, nails-against-the-chalkboard voice, "Finally.  We have someones to play with us."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell, accept a copy of Jaecob Muhlen? (Type yes/no)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>yes</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Copied Jaecob Muhlen to Maouelue/Dieter's storage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob's terror at the situation starts to give way to a roiling fury. The unholy vestiges of his father's hubris have undone what should have otherwise been a peaceful and noble existence. That the sickness is perpetuated in his brother and that the strings of that fate have led him here, to the literal brink of the abyss is too much, it was bound to boil over at some point...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His eyes bulge red as his rage overtakes him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Real Runemark rages forward, a guttural string of profanities spewing forth in hoarse shouts as he unsheathes his shortsword, channeling all of his repressed anger into the taunting Drow. Gone is the fear, gone is the acquiescence. Dieter's words have stirred him to take control of his own fate.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>"Take that you fucking bastards! I'll kill the lot of you!"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen swipes through one and red goo spurts from it.  They all react in pain!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Eat the shit that you are, fiend!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It lets out a long screech as the remaining goo coalesces into the last remaining drow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Jaecob revel in their destruction of the monster!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco ruffles his tentacles, wings, and various other appendages as he lurches in to get a <i>taste</i> of the action.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Time to burn."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"One way or another..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacles reach out to strike at the mess, just as the fire starts pouring from Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco tries to find the thing's brain, but cannot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come on then, let's have it!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The shell shocked snail slaps out with a frenzied overkill of tentacles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last eyestalk hits, the goo is flung <i>everywhere</i>, and a long, sad, sighing shriek can be heard, slowly fading away into nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well done team! We may just get out of this yet!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[2,000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now Flayco....where did you put that <i>ball?</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group regains their composure, two things are very much clear to everyone.  First, the miasma is almost completely depleted.  Second, the disc is about to fall.  Third, there is <i>a lot</i> more noise now coming from the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Flayco, think you could fly over there and bring that disc back here? It's like a ball, but flat...and floating over a pit of miasma..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><s>Flayco takes some time, fakes out a couple times and tries some running starts.  Jaecob gets on the other side, just to be safe.  Finally, the young dragon monster gets a good running start...  and jumps...</s></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter holds out the large staff to Jaecob, and together they help span the deadly pit.  The miasma is almost completely gone now, the disc is hovering just a few inches off of the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco hops on and starts traversing.  Halfway over, he gets the disc in his tentacles and continues crossing towards Jaecob.  Dieter, however, looks down and sees red eyes looking back and him.  The staff wavers...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Careful there now lads!" The leverage of the wyrmling on the end of the staff tests the Druid's strength as his eyes peer downward.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The staff stays put as the wyrmling snatches the disc, takes one look down, and bolts to Jaecob's side.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco immediately spits the disc on the ground, as if it burned him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter strokes the grotesque, yet oddly cuddly, crossbreed lovingly. "You did good there boy, reaaaal good!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks over at Shelli, who seems a bit jealous of the attention.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And Shelli! You <i>bashed</i> that other monstrosity! Great job the lot of you!" He caresses her shell with the back of his hand, running his nails across the gaps in her ridges of spikes.</p></div>
