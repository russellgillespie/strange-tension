<div class="character-1"><p>The eldritch fire sears out and blasts the fire snake back into a rock formation behind it.  All four adventurers hear muffled shouts coming from behind the snake and the outcropping.  Suddenly, small orange creatures atop what can only be described as lizards walking on their hind legs, come out and attack!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees his conjured familiar in the corner of the cave, knocked out but otherwise fine.  There are three tunnels branching out W, one in the middle is glowing with a faint purple and yellow light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a moment to wake up his familiar then they all proceed into the middle passage together.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group steps over the carcasses of the snake and newts, some still astride their mounts.  The ice from the metallicomets melts in puddles around them.  There is an eerie purple and yellow glow coming from the tunnel.  As the group moves closer, they can see it is coming from a bulbous mushroom standing just over three feet tall, and almost five feet wide from the cap.  There are a few yellow fungi in the S side of the room, emitting a fainter glow.  Every now and again, the yellow mushrooms tuck down close to the ground then <i>puff</i> up, releasing spores into the air.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bella, Benna, this seems like your area of expertise. What do you make of this glowing toadstool?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look but come up confused.  "These...  are not known to us.  They must be only found in the Feywild.  Did you want us to investigate them further?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yes, let's do. I will inspect it for magical properties."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets about exploring the mushroom in more detail, trying to sense what magic might be emanating from it. He takes a few  spore samples as he does and stows them for later investigation as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>For the purple one...</i>  (Arcana check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't really tell what it is, or what it does, but he gets a sense that it might be hostile if he tries to harm it in any way.  (Con save to get near the yellow ones, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard can get closer enough to a group of yellow fungi without harmful effects of the airborne spores.  That being said, they're still pretty strange looking.  Maouelue doesn't get the sense that they're magical, though.  They might have some interesting properties, but further examination would need to be done.  (An alchemist would have proficiency on investigation checks for this, fyi.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue gets closer into the area, he sees that getting past these mushrooms without touching them might be a tricky business.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"On second thought...let me take a slightly different vantage on these...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves back and directs his familiar to harvest some of the species and return them to a  piece of parchment he lays out for the purpose.</p></div>
