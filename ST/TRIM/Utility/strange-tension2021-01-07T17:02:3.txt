strange-tensionDieter, dripping with dew, feels a drop plop from his mop down on top of his crop. He takes it in between the thumb and forefinger of his left hands and beckons the moonbeam to invoke the tides!

Dieter watches as the water washes over the 'drow'.  A few fade away into nothingness, then they turn to the red ooze again.  It merges into the other forms, making the others grow larger.  Three very muscled drow now look down at you and smile.  As one, in a grating, nails-against-the-chalkboard voice, "Finally.  We have someones to play with us."
@Russell, accept a copy of Jaecob Muhlen? (Type yes/no)
yes
Copied Jaecob Muhlen to Maouelue/Dieter's storage.


Jaecob's terror at the situation starts to give way to a roiling fury. The unholy vestiges of his father's hubris have undone what should have otherwise been a peaceful and noble existence. That the sickness is perpetuated in his brother and that the strings of that fate have led him here, to the literal brink of the abyss is too much, it was bound to boil over at some point...

His eyes bulge red as his rage overtakes him.
The Real Runemark rages forward, a guttural string of profanities spewing forth in hoarse shouts as he unsheathes his shortsword, channeling all of his repressed anger into the taunting Drow. Gone is the fear, gone is the acquiescence. Dieter's words have stirred him to take control of his own fate.


"Take that you fucking bastards! I'll kill the lot of you!"


It is not your turn.
Muhlen swipes through one and red goo spurts from it.  They all react in pain!

"Eat the shit that you are, fiend!"
It lets out a long screech as the remaining goo coalesces into the last remaining drow.


Dieter and Jaecob revel in their destruction of the monster!
It is not your turn.

Flayco ruffles his tentacles, wings, and various other appendages as he lurches in to get a *taste* of the action.

It is not your turn.
"Time to burn."

"One way or another..."
The tentacles reach out to strike at the mess, just as the fire starts pouring from Dieter.
Flayco tries to find the thing's brain, but cannot.
"Come on then, let's have it!"

The shell shocked snail slaps out with a frenzied overkill of tentacles.
As the last eyestalk hits, the goo is flung *everywhere*, and a long, sad, sighing shriek can be heard, slowly fading away into nothing.
"Well done team! We may just get out of this yet!"
[2,000 xp]

"Now Flayco....where did you put that *ball?*"
As the group regains their composure, two things are very much clear to everyone.  First, the miasma is almost completely depleted.  Second, the disc is about to fall.  Third, there is *a lot* more noise now coming from the pit.
"Flayco, think you could fly over there and bring that disc back here? It's like a ball, but flat...and floating over a pit of miasma..."
~~Flayco takes some time, fakes out a couple times and tries some running starts.  Jaecob gets on the other side, just to be safe.  Finally, the young dragon monster gets a good running start...  and jumps...~~


Dieter holds out the large staff to Jaecob, and together they help span the deadly pit.  The miasma is almost completely gone now, the disc is hovering just a few inches off of the ground.
Flayco hops on and starts traversing.  Halfway over, he gets the disc in his tentacles and continues crossing towards Jaecob.  Dieter, however, looks down and sees red eyes looking back and him.  The staff wavers...
"Careful there now lads!" The leverage of the wyrmling on the end of the staff tests the Druid's strength as his eyes peer downward.


The staff stays put as the wyrmling snatches the disc, takes one look down, and bolts to Jaecob's side.
Flayco immediately spits the disc on the ground, as if it burned him.
Dieter strokes the grotesque, yet oddly cuddly, crossbreed lovingly. "You did good there boy, reaaaal good!"
He looks over at Shelli, who seems a bit jealous of the attention.
"And Shelli! You *bashed* that other monstrosity! Great job the lot of you!" He caresses her shell with the back of his hand, running his nails across the gaps in her ridges of spikes.
The growing family pulls in close and inspects the disc while Jaecob, still enraged, huffs and puffs and looks down at the remainder inside the pit.


(Lmao
just saw that)


The miasma evaporates as the disc moves from the top.  Jaecob peers into the darkness.  Many sets of red eyes stare back at him, from the deep recesses.  Could it be rats?  Fey creatures?  The abyssal monsters he fears most?

He buckles down and fights his fear, but the roiling blackness shows him no more...
