<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>I'm here for a tension</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(🙂)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Format will be.

Regular text is descriptor text.
italics  will be for thoughts (or just say it's a thought in regular text.
(OOC:     ) will be out of character
"   " will be what your character is saying.

I always find it better reading if you put talking lines on separate lines.

"Like this"

Then moving on to the next line of descriptive text.

<p>@Russell </p><p>lately trying to keep an ear out for any sign</p><p>of adventure and you hear a lot about what</p><p>is going on in the town. It’s no surprise that</p><p>you have begun to recognise lots of the</p><p>patrons and stall owners. Many are just</p><p>weekly customers and some regular</p><p>travellers from a nearby village but you also</p><p>have your chaperoned nobles from the</p><p>merchant sector and adventurers looking</p><p>for supplies. Much like you they standout,</p><p>something about their bearing making</p><p>them noteworthy. You’ve also come to</p><p>know some of traders by first name and</p><p>when one day you’re standing looking at</p><p>the spices on the colourful exotics stall you</p><p>spot the merchant Culver quietly talking to</p><p>a miner, concerned looks on their faces.</p><p>You sidle up to within ear shot and pretend</p><p>to examine the ceramic kettles on the</p><p>barter stall.</p><p>“Have you seen Douglas recently?”</p><p>“I saw him at the Pig and Falcon a fortnight</p><p>passed but not recently, why do you ask?”</p><p>“He was meant to be working up at the</p><p>Mine at Krytos Hills, you know beyond the</p><p>red plain, but I haven’t seen him of late.</p><p>Usually he’s at the Pig as you say.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t think there’s anything to worry</p><p>about. He’s probably just camped out</p><p>somewhere.”</p><p>“Nobody has seen him.”</p><p>“Not even down the Pig?”</p><p>“No, it’s been a while and I’ve known him</p><p>for an age. For Douglas to spend this much</p><p>time away from the tavern seems very</p><p>strange.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“The problem is Culver, that I’ve heard</p><p>there are goblins roaming those parts</p><p>recently. I just hope the old fool hasn’t got</p><p>himself into trouble.”<i>himself into trouble.”</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "'scuse me gents...I couldn't help overhearing that your friend might be in a spot of bother. Is there anything a couple of adventurers like myself and my wizard friend here aught do to help?"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Miner: "Wizard friend, you say?!  Well, I suppose you could help, might take a wizard at that.  You familiar with Krytos Hill?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "I've heard tell of the place, yes, but a Wizard is always open to others' ears."

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Culver: "Aye, you might have heard, then, there is silver in those hills.  Huge veins of it, enough to make ten men richer than the richest man in Waterdeep.  Our friend Douglas was on the team mining it.  He always comes back to town bragging about how much he's bringing in.  Either someone has caught him up on the lies, or something's happened in that mine, because he hasn't been back for some time now."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: "It would appear that your friend might be in peril even as we speak. Maouelue, I fear we must hasten away before the hour is past."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: "Indeed, I would not let an innocent man face a needless fate. Let's away at once."

*The miner reaches into his bag and says:*
"Hey, take this.  It might help."
*Miner gives you an overland map with the way to the mine marked clearly.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “When one knows the way, one knows there are other paths as well. We will take this in good faith our path is the righteous one.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *this guy...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You heading out then, or is there anything else you'd like to do before you go?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Yes...let's away on our *righteous* path...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue unfolds the map and shows it to Dieter. They both look at each other and nod to head directly toward the mine on foot.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're still about 40 feet away from the entrance, just fyi.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let us approach with caution. There appears to be someone home.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue approaches the cave entrance from the right, Dieter from the left.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter calls out magnanimously: "Hello in there. Is anybody home?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *I see what "Caution" means to a Druid...*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is no response.  You hear the calls echo throughout and rebound and come back to you very quickly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let us enter and inspect this encampment more closely.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I'll take the lead.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Any form of light?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue lights a torch.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
As you peek into the cavern entrance you see:
*This open space feels like a crucible, cut
into the hill side. The rock has been chipped
away and a floor created. The first thing
that strikes you are the two bedrolls
situated next to a circle of stones that
surround a fire. A chest sits in the shadow
of the rock face, next to one of the bedrolls.
Chips of stone lay around and a box
apparently full of rocks sits to one side.
There are five tunnels leading into darkness
spaced around the wall and appear to have
once been the focus for the workers.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Well, I never could say no to a peek inside a chest in these situations... Let's have a peep-see.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Your kleptomancy will be the death of us one day.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *shrugs and attempts to open the chest anyway*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How are you checking the chest?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Manual inspection)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You go to inspect the chest and see that the lock has already been broken off, in a brutal fashion. </p><p>(Do you want to check for traps?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Please...Don't go blindly to your fate my friend. Let me check that for any malfeasance.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: *checking for traps. check check checkity check*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
(Investigation check, please :))

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(NAT 1...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue opens the chest.  It creaks and a very noxious odor comes out.  Take 1 point of damage from the nausea that comes over you.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
Maouelue: 7/8 (-1)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
(Had to look it up :P)

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the wizard looks in, he sees random body parts, rotting and creating an ooze a the bottom of the chest.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice!  Have you used Discord before at all?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Poor souls..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yup! Quite a bit actually. Haven't done too much modding though)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Awesome!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Well...that...that is not what I was hoping to find. Let us not end up that way ourselves, old friend...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception check?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Indeed.”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Dieter notices two things.  The bedrolls have a layer of dust on them, indicating they've been there for a while, maybe a tenday.  Second, the sound echoes strangely deeper in, giving it a weird, unbalanced vibe.  It could be the way the stone was mined or the way the tunnels go, but the acoustics are giving everything a strange, undulating texture to speech and sounds.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “These walls seem to vibrate with a strange energy. In your scholarship have you ever read of anything similar?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let me recollect...”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(History check?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hit it up!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue taps into his Eleven history, recalling a bit about silver having a strange property when it comes to sound.  Silver mines are known to play with miner's inner ear, make them unbalanced and groggy.  It's not unheard of for miners in silver mines to wear items over their ears to protect them from the sound.   However, it does leave them open to attack, if they don't have the proper security on hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Let not the sound of the waves in the chamber affect your eyes young druid. The spells weaved by the silver in these places can intoxicate even as they prey.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Understood. Years of practice ignoring your more asinine statements will have prepared me will for this. Heh, amirite?”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Honestly...”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: *zing*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “Let's keep track of our path as we delve deeper. Keep to the left.”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The company moves into the hallway left of the cave entrance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I was just checking on that.  We'll say you both sit for a while, getting your bearings and Maouelue casts his spell out to find a bat.  Animal handling check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think the spells just summons a spirit bat)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>About a half hour into Maouelue's meditation, a group of bats flies by outside in the darkening dusk.  One of them breaks from the pack to glide into the edge of the cavern mouth.  It lands, upside down, right above the wizard.  It's eyes are open, however, and it's eyeing Dieter hungrily.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter side-eyes the bat</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Dieter: “I know I’m a Druid, but bats...Eesh...”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat hisses at Dieter.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sends his bat down the first hallway to inspect past the taper.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat flies down the hallway.  A couple of minutes later, it comes back.</p><p>(Animal handing check, with advantage.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “There there Dieter, we’ll get you over your Chiroptophobia one day.”

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bat lands above the wizard and, telepathically, relays what he saw.  There were two bedrolls, moth eaten and dusty.  Silver ore veins ran rampant through the far end of the tunnel.  The taper stops several feet in, good silver available there.  There is something strange, though, at the beginning of the narrowing.  Something...  empty.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: thinks to the bat *does your sonar detect anything behind the walls?*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>You receive - "Walls too thick."</p><p>(Is Dieter at the mouth of the tunnel by chance?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>When the bat returns, Dieter casually, but obviously, wanders away from the bat and toward the taper.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception for Dieter.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Take care that way my friend. The bat tells me there is something suspicious about those walls.

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Dieter approaches the narrowing of the walls, the stairs off to the right become more and more evident.  The reason being is that Dieter now can hear snuffling and scratching coming from down that corridor.  The stairs go down at a very steep angle.</p>

Everyone roll for initiative!
If you have a character set up with SheetManager: `!init join`
If it's a 5e monster: `!init madd <monster name>`
Otherwise: `!init add <modifier> <name>`

<p><i>The first dog, emaciated and snarling, lunges for Dieter and misses.  The goblin, reaching for his scimitar, gets confused and thinks about going for his shortbow instead and misses his turn.  The next dog runs head-on to Dieter.   He stands his ground the the dogs bite just misses his leg.</i></p>

<p><i>The first dog tries to right itself, only to flail out with a hasty bit, missing the elusive Dieter.  The goblin, finally deciding to use the scimitar, stumbles, overcorrects, then falls on his scimitar, eviscerating itself.  The last dog takes a hefty bite, doing some damage to Deiter.</i></p>
