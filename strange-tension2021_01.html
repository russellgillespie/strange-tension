<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sends out a blast of flame, then picks out a wilting shamrock from his pack and hums an Old Irish Blessing to his bladestaff.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli schlurps over to the ooze and makes a large “Beeeeeaaalk” noise then hits out with her remaining tentacles.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The green slime is now glowing, wreathed in flames.  The humanoid figure's eyes are clouded, but it looks furious.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The green goo attaches onto a stalk of Shelli's and Dieter sees the snail shudder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brings the fury of the wind blowing through the dunegrass onto the Ooze's head(?) splattering bits of goo everywhere. Startled by her extra gooey stalks, she flails out wildly, battering the Ooze into a pulp even after it capitulates still swinging.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Splatt</i> The goo splits all over the floor, splattering the tiles and tents with a green sheen.  The clicking and beating are louder now, coming from the golden box under the altar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes note of the increased volume coming from the altar, but turns instead to Frume, taking note of his condition and trying to bring him around.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob is unconscious but stable, he's suffering from some magical effect that is not arcane nor deific.  It's unlike anything you've seen before... expect when checking on the crystals.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter considers this then brings a few of the crystals over placing three in a circle around Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes 1 point of damage as he touches the crystals.  Suddenly, the voices start up again.</p><p>"Tie this off, quickly..."</p><p>"HOW could they just disappear?..."</p><p>"... Should be ready now...."</p><p>"...Pretty sure I won that last one..."</p><p>"Brains...  BRAINS..."</p><p>"There is no way out!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid brings the glowing crystals closer to Jaecob, Muhlen starts twitching and going into seizures.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter quickly hurries the crystals away to the opposite side of the room, taking note of their strange properties. The connection to these voices seems important, but he’s not sure how much more he can take. He rushes back over to Jaecob to check on his condition.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pours a bit of water from his skin onto Jaecob’s forehead.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tremors stop as the crystals are retreated.  As the water pours onto the man's head, Dieter doesn't get the sense that it helps all that much, but the man does seem to be more at peace.  Still unconscious, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter has an idea. He heads back over to one of the crystals and attempts to bash it with the Eagle end of his bladestaff.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His aim is pretty terrible though, so he tries again to hit the unmoving object right below him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He really wants to make sure it’s taken a proper beating so he tries yet again.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes two points of damage as he is pushed back by a psychic blast from the crystals.  They are not damaged.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid is very wary of the chest at the altar. He's feeling the panic of the situation closing in upon him. He walks back away from the mesmerizing crystals. And begins to line up toward the chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter walks towards the chest, he sees the egg is now shaking a little.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He stays about 15 feet away and sends a blast of flame at it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flame erupts from the druid and heads toward the altar.  It explodes, and as it does, the fire is drawn into the egg-shaped icon.  It grows in size, slightly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beating and clicking get louder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>There's nothing for it. He's going to tempt the fate of the egg. He steps a few feet further back and sends out another jet of flame.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gout of flame speeds towards the altar.  Again, the same happens.  The magic is wholly swallowed by the egg-shaped item on the table.  It grows again.  The beating and clicking get louder still.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, I wonder...”, mutters The Deleter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He sends a shard of ice to blast over at the ticking egg.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Ice erupts from the druid's hands, forming a spike.  It careens towards the object of his ire, but it looks like it's going to miss by at least a foot or so...  then the particles of magic that created the spike atomize, all of it being sucked into the now burgeoning egg-shape.  It tilts a little on it's stand.  The chest is also moving, seemingly trying to get away from the item on the altar.  The beating is getting frantic, as is the clicking.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The egg has now grown to the size of a large watermelon.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Now trying to think of anything to coax this egg into opening without enlarging anymore, he blurts out one of the only words he knows in this language. “<i>Sungovall...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The egg tilts and buckles, but not from the words.  It is growing again.  As Dieter speaks the foreign word, grinding stone is heard behind him.  The door in the curved wall is opening.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Shit! Shit! Shit!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sungovall!” He tries again now to get the door to close, if indeed that’s how it works. He’s starting to panic now.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door stops several inches open.  A <i>whooshing</i> sound emanates from the dark room beyond.  The egg-shape wobbles dangerously on the pedestal.  The beating and clicking rise to a fever pitch.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To make matters worse, streaks of blood can be seen coming from Jaecob's ears.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter resigns himself to what must be done. He runs over and picks up the egg, trying to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Picking up the egg, battling the noise and the nausea that threatens to undo him, Dieter grips the egg-shape in two and and <i>rips</i>!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Because it is growing, the shell hasn't been able to keep up with the growth.  Seen now up close, it is scaly, hot to the touch, and Dieter can even see an appendage poking out, trying to break free from the inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The egg's skin is stretched to the breaking point.  As Dieter grips the sides, a small clawed arm comes up and out of the top!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes ancillary damage as egg goo splashes on him.  As he drops the egg, the whole thing splatters and breaks on the ground.  Inside, a writhing animal tries to right itself and stand.  The thing is a mass of tentacles, appendages, claws, and scales.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The being is half baby dragon, half mind flayer.  Its face is a mass of tentacles, its beady eyes search out for one of its kind.  The voices have abated since the door has opened, but ever since the dragon-flayer has emerged, you can pick up its birthing cries telepathically.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[600 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[300 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter immediately loses all sense of fear at seeing the baby animal, his druidic roots coming to the fore. He begins to lock eyes with it and tries to tend to it as best he can. He speaks to it softly and offers it some water.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby, wet and scrabbling for purchase, looks up at Dieter.  Cocking its head, it tries to understand.  Seeing the waterskin, he cocks its head to the other side, reminding Dieter a bit of a newborn puppy.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco's tentacles creep over the water, and the baby <i>sloughs</i> over to it to drink.  While drinking, an errant tentacle searches out for the rations.  It wraps around the food, and immediately, passes it over in search of other nibbles.  It finishes with the water, opens its eyes, and blinks; first one eye, then the other, then both together.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then it sees the unconscious Jaecob on the floor.  It cocks its head...  and moves toward the prone man.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rushes over and gets in between Flayco and Jaecob. “No!” He sternly gestures with a raised finger. “We’ll find you summat else to eat Flayco.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli, trembling, moves into her Shell Defense.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Remembering the black dragon whelp and the pantry, Dieter begins thinking about next steps while he awaits Flayco’s response.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby dragon cocks its head at Dieter, not quite understanding.  Shelli is so large, the illithi-dragon doesn't understand it to be a being.  However, it turns back to it's quarry in Jaecob and tries to move around Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It holds off as Dieter goes to block it's path, however.  It looks up, curiously.  Small tentacles reach out towards the druid.  A small, circular mouth rimmed with tiny teeth is at the center where the tentacles connect with the baby dragon's face.  It coos, eerily.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter thinks hard. He beckons the fledgling to follow him toward the door. As he approaches he glances at one of the gems and gets an idea. He picks one up, bracing for the pain, and holds it up at arms length to Flayco. "Do you know what this is baby?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The baby cocks its head to the side again, staring at the pretty pink-purple gem.  It's beating too, although soundlessly.  It flashes slightly, catching the baby's beady eyes.  The dragon lets out a coo that turns into a shrill shriek that turns into a hyena-type click/laughing.  It turns its head to look back and Jaecob, then turns back to the crystal.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thoughts intrude again, but not as intensely as before.  A small breeze comes from the other room, catching Dieter's clothes and rustling them innocently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tosses the crystal through the crack in the door trying to lure Flayco out and away from Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crystal <i>plinks</i> through the crack and into the other room, landing lightly on the floor.  Flayco meanders over to the door, taking another look back at Jaecob, longingly.  As the dragon peeks into the room, it rears, then starts backing away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What is it Flayco?”, Dieter sidles over and fingers his ring going invisible and peeking through the crack.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter peeks into the room.  It is pitch black everywhere but a little patch of pink-purple glow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to slooooooowly close the stone doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a peek back to make sure his new...whatever it is...is not eating Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door doesn't move at all.  The dragon baby is still shaking it's head, but when it stops, it's searching for food.  Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid’s mind is doing circles. He comes back over to Jaecob and shakes him a bit. “Jaecob! Jaecob! Wake up! It’s Dieter! Your mind is here in this world!........I’ve got ale!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There needs to be a magical cure to take him out of this state.  The baby dragon's tentacles starts meandering over Jaecob's feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here! Eat this!”, Dieter exasperatedly throws one last chunk of snake meat that he had somehow missed earlier when feeding Shelli. “Just stay clear of this man!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The meat hits the animal straight in the face.  It backs away, frightened...   (Animal handling check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It backs away, frightened, it's feelings hurt.  It comes over to Dieter after a few moments, trying to make amends.  The tentacles strain to find Dieter's hand for comfort.  An errant one stretches for Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Now now Flayco, I’m sorry I hit you with that. My hand was a bit shaky and...Don’t Eat Jaecob! He’s a friend. Friiiieeeeennnndd. F. R. I. E. N. D. Friend. Got it?” He gives a reassuring rub on the top of the whelp’s head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It gives the high pitched squeal that settles to a purr.  (Gotta start calling Dieter Flacco from now on...)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a clanking that comes from the chest, the clicking has taken a strange cast.  Probably because it's been going crazy for so long.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We’ll go find some tasty thief for you pup, there’s plenty to go around. No Jaecob though y’hear?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks worriedly at the chest. “I’m gonna go see what this is all about.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It cocks it's head at Dieter again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He gives a stern two-eyed stare back at the beast and points two fingers at his own eyes, the rotates them back and forth between he and it. He then proceeds over to the chest and gives it an inspection.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks into the chest to find a human heart.  Which is still beating, thanks to the workings of a small object.  Dieter blinks.  Blinks again.  He could swear it looks just like a goldfish.  In a small sphere.  On closer inspection, it is just that.  A clockwork fish swimming and floating, helping the heart continue it's macabre beating.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Bloody waters!” The distressed druid decrees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A vision of the clean, refreshing wate of the Sword Coast flashes through his mind. Calling him home. He can’t go on like this much longer, without light, without air, without green and blue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out to pick up the wretched object, his furry hands quivering as he does so. “Formulated Flippers! This is some piece of work...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing is still wet to the touch, it still looks healthy enough.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter studies the heart, all of it's workings, the connections to the machination.  A small voice speaks up in the back of his mind... </p><p><i>"The damn flayers took out my heart!  To the Hells with them, Druid!  We must send them from whence they came.  Hurry, now.  You almost have everything you need to dispose of their filth.  Destroy their gruesome experiment and take the weapon from the other room.  Then we shall be rid of this prison for good!"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter wraps the fishheart globe in what wrappings he can find and stows it in his pack. He wonders is the good folks over at Bags of Holding Inc.™️ have added a soundproofing feature, then supposed he’ll find out soon enough, at any rate this one is value all the way. He tightens the pack back up then calls to his menagerie. “Time to move out!” He knocks on Shelli’s shell and beckons her out. “Hey there girl, I need you to do me a solid. Can you carry out friend here?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He assumes whatever “Blaaaalkkkeee” means is some form of snail assent and begins to load Jaecob’s prone body onto the Flail Snail, hoping the shell is comfortable enough to ride but not enough to sleep.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter turns around and sees Flayco nibbling on Jaecob's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Don’t. Eat. JAECOB!!!” He shrieks at the mass of wings and tentacles. He tries to pry off the hungry hungry Flayco from the only Human company that remains to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacles rise, Flayco looks at the druid.  Dieter can see the little, sharp teeth drawing blood on Jaecob's forehead.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls the heart-fish-globe back out and holds it up directly in front of Flayco’s eyes, waving it back and forth in a hypnotic manner. “Do you want this ball? Do ya? Do you want this ball?” He then rolls it away from Jaecob back through the weave of tents and says, “Go get it!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Clearly the psychic damage is taking its toll on the Druid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter hears a disgusting <i>slurpp</i> as the baby dragon peels itself off of Jaecob.  It's beady eyes lock on to the sphere and he scrabbles after it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shouts, “That’s my good boy!”, then turns to examine the fresh would on his incapacitated friend with the increasingly inconvenient illithid ingestion injury.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hair on top of his head is now matted with blood.  There is a small tracing of marks around the crown of his head, but it looks like this was too big of a quarry for the little illithi-dragon.  Still, Muhlen is not looking great.  He is still stable, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ok kids, time to go!” He beckons Shelli, with the blighted man on her back, over to the door and searches around for the scrabbling Flayco, “Here boy! Time to go find some meat!” </p><p>He marches determinedly toward the stone door. </p><p>“<i>Sungovall</i>...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door starts opening again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The motley crew shuffles, schlurps, and scampers through the door. Dieter eyes the scene cautiously and moves to the other magical door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads the menagerie to the curved wall, amazed at his dumb luck in the accidental linguistic limbo he’s be meandering through. He produces a flame to light the way, bracing for the impending psychic itch.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone door opens inward on the group, they all wait with bated breath to see the room beyond.  <i>Scraaaaape</i> The stone leaves a groove on the dusty floor.  By the light of Dieter's flame, he can view a circular room, unlit but with ready torches ensconced in the walls.  A few tattered tents are set up, but the main feature is a circular pit in the center of the room.  Dark clouds rage and roll in a pit, shadow lightning arcs and crackles without sound or light.  Above this miasma, as if floating atop it, looks to be a clay disc of sorts.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid moves around the room, careful not to get too close to the pit, he can see more of their surroundings.  There are several tables set up as workbenches.  Various items are strewn about, most of them used in some form of herbalism or construction aspects.  There is a large stone structure on the W side of the wall.  In front of it is a strange cylinder, set on its side, with four vertical sections with strange glyphs on them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sends his flame over to the nearest sconce and lights one of Jaecob’s torches from the resulting flame, moving around the room to light the rest. He snuffs out the torch he is holding and stows it back into Jaecob’s pack. He uses the resulting light to investigate all the markings in the room and to inspect the herbs for anything that might help his companion, as well as general healing and alchemical reagents.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lights ignite in their sconces one by one as Dieter traverses the room.  The last one is lit and the group can see the details of the work spaces.  Various herbs and accoutrement are scattered hither and yon, nothing looks fresh or even edible at this point.  Sticks can be seen sticking out of what presumably was a shrub or tree, all of it desiccated now.  There is a thrum in the air, and Dieter notices it gets more intense as he gets nearer the clay disc in the center of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes similar precautions to the last room casting his spell of detection.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are pings from the detect magic spell.  The cryptex in front of the stone structure gives off abjuration magic.  The disc is giving off the greatest magic signature he's ever experienced.  It threatens to overwhelm Dieter.  Abjuration plus another school he can't define are emanating from the disc.  The miasma is abjuration mixed with heavy evocation magics.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes time to inspect the glyphs on the cryptex with great care, hovering and tracing his fingers over the shapes about two inches away from the object.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are extremely odd looking.  (Roll an intelligence check.  Also, perception check too, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What Dieter sees is a bunch of dashes written in horizontal lines.  There doesnt seem to be a consistency or pattern to them at all.  Looking around the area, in the remnants of a collapsed tent, Dieter spies a rucksack.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Now what in the nine could this be?”, the Druid mutters as he shuffles over to the sack and takes a look inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>xmrfx hermano</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter opens the sack.  Inside he finds various gems worth 1,000 gp collectively.  He also finds a filigreed bowl with waves, aquatic life, and ocean scenes etched in silver.  Lastly, there is a black book that is bound with a leather thong, tied tightly in the front.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stows the items and inspects the book, just then wondering to himself whether Flayco ever did retrieve that clockwork ball...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A gold 'dragon', a coin from Waterdeep, is bound in the middle of the leather rope.  As its undone, the book falls open.  Draconic script mixes with common and the same horizontal lines on the cylinder.  (Intelligence check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco did not bring the sphere back.  (That doesn't mean he didn't find it, however...)</p><p>Dieter reads through the book, really taking his time to try and decipher the writing.  After a handful of pages, he can definitely tell this was Lord Muhlen's.  It looks like the wizard was trying to piece together the language of the illithids, known as Qualith.  The writing is more of a textural representation of emotions and larger concepts than actual words specifically.  Lord Muhlen notes that humanoids are not able to read Qualith, or else they could go mad.  Needless to say, the last few pages were his tests into deciphering the code to the cryptex.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes the items in hand and looks over the cryptex once more, now taking in all the shapes. He retreats toward the door and attempts to close it with a word. He then beckons Flayco over and tries to get him to settle. He has a mind to sit down and meditate on these writings for awhile before he takes it a step further...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter lays his hands on Jaecob.  A golden glow, tinged with a little aquamarine blue, surrounds the two.  The glow abates, and Jaecob slooowly opens his eyes.  He blinks;  Looks around.  Sees Flayco on the ground, trying to get up on Shelli.  The baby dragon sits back down and scratches the back of its head with a hind leg.  It then tries to hop back onto Shelli, still trying to get up.  Jaecob's eyes go <i>very</i> wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Jaecob! You’re awake! Fear not...this is <i>Flayco</i>. He’s one of us now. I’ll explain more later. Here, take this...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He offers up the last bottle of Golden Dragon Ale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here, I saved the last for you.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He accepts the bottle but cannot take his eyes, his <i>wide</i> eyes, away from the monster on the ground.</p><p>"Fa... fa....  F....    Flayco, ye say?"  He paused a beat, taking it all in.  "Nice name, that."  He looks towards Dieter.  </p><p>"What in the fucking Nine Hells did I miss?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well, you...kind of...blacked out. That chest in the last chamber was an ooze monster which we laid low, and the golden egg there, well...it turns out it was Flayco. </p><p></p><p>I’m sorry, this must all seem a bad dream, and believe me, I’m on the verge myself, but, I could not leave a whelp uncared for. What with the dread power hunger of your father, along with his spirit’s captivity at the hands of the illithids and your usurper brother, I feel we must do everything in our power to resist! </p><p></p><p>It would seem this poor creature was bred for one purpose. I plan to undo that. I will take what energies our foes have pooled and whirl them back one-hundred fold with the wrath of scorned, the enmity of the exiled! </p><p></p><p>Just think...you, me, poor Shelli, and indeed perhaps most of all wretched Flayco here are castaways. Bastards of circumstance. Our stories have been writ by the hands who misunderstand, the hands who manipulate our very life essences to their whims. </p><p></p><p>I tell you all, right here, right now, <i>I will not let this stand!</i> Join with me, Jaecob! Slide with me Shelli! Flock with me Flayco! We will undo our would be undoers to their abominable doom!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Somewhere in the back of Dieter's mind, he feels the pull of his friend Maouelue.  He imagines his friend giving the same kind of speech, wherever he might be.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob shakes his head to clear it.  "Ab...absolutely!  You know we're behind you!  Let's get things done and get to some sunshine, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Two alms to that <i>brother</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen slips off the back of the giant snail shell.  Stretching his back and muscles, he looks around the room.  "Where are we?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The Sunless Citadel...”, Dieter almost <i>spits</i> the words as he hisses his derision for the labyrinthine fortress.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen does a double take, then goggles at the druid.  "The...  Did you just say we're in the Sunless Citadel?  <span style='color: black; background: black;'>Fucking bugger, he found it.</span>"  The last of his words fade into sibilant whispers, nearly unheard by Dieter.  Jaecob looks to Dieter. "We <i>have</i> to get out of this place, Dieter.  Besides my deranged brother's minions and the flayers, there are horrible abominations.  Like, from the Abysss abominations..."  He looks around, starting to get frantic.  His eyes alight on the illithi-dragon.  Softly, he whispers, "They could be anywhere."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter and Muhlen are talking, the druid hears a crackling, creaking sound from behind him.  Flayco is around the area you hear the noise coming from.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter spins around on the spot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last vestages of the dead tree are creeping up on your dragon/illithid/puppy.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to send a blast of flame over to the tree, but for some reason his spell fizzles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A branch reaches out and grabs onto the puppy-illithid, making it yelp.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A dark purple arm, longer than a humanoid arm is supposed to be, starts reaching from the edge of the pit towards...  (1-Dieter, 2-Jaecob)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>“Away fiend!”</span> <i>Abyssal</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob grabs his head as Dieter speaks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Gods, I wish you wouldn't do that!" he says through clenched teeth.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can tell it's not an Abyssal creature, but it is not natural either.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arm looks almost drow-like...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But it's too elongated to be a drow's.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter's dark eyes seem to merge with the shadows from the abyss. Then...slowly...a light begins to form in his eyes, at first like a tiny pinprick in the void, then expanding with the tidal gravity of the moon. A silvery beam of light seems to emerge from the air and stone above, falling down as a beacon of ghostly radiance on the abominable tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls out the Staff of Baobab as he does this and holds it close in front of him between his eyes, feeling its energy of life pulsating inside him. He stands and awaits the fel reply.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The moonbeam hits the tree and it shrivels instantly, blown back by the blast.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco jumps out of the way just in time to miss the beam.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Uh... Dieter...  Might want to aim that beam over yonder..."  Jaecob points toward the arm which is now elongating across the room towards him.  He's backing away, trying to get out of the way of the disgusting sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sword sticks into the arm, no blood emerges.  The laugh turns into a growl.  The arm lifts itself off the ground, somehow, and reaches out to Muhlen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite, shite, SHITE!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Jaecob!!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter swirls his concentration around on the gross groping arm, sending the moonbeam flying across the room to defend his friend.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beam of moonlight laces across the floor, narrowly missing Flayco.  What it doesn't miss is the arm, which disintegrates in a puff of smoke and sizzle.  Part of the miasma that is keeping the disc afloat also gets sliced by the beam, though.  The horrors beneath scream out in pain, for just an instant.  The disc rocks on the roiling cloud.  A strange tension permeates the room...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter moves the moonbeam directly over the miasma, then picks up a few bits of rubble and charges them, handing them over to Jaecob. “Might need something less mundane for what’s coming...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Get ready to strike! And for gods sake, stay back! Shelli, get your shell nice and shiny for whatever comes up. Flayco...do...whatever it is you do! We’re all in this together!!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob grabs the stones and readies his sword.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stench of sulfur fills the air as something large buffets against the miasma.  Once, twice, thrice it rams the dense fog, trying to jar it loose or end it's effect.  The disc atop the surface wobbles, rights itself, then tips with the last knock against the dark cloud.  Jaecob looks at Dieter.  "Is that important enough to try and reach?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hells if I know! Let’s just stay alive!...Come on now you devils, show yourselves!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As if on cue, as soon as Dieter speaks the words, a strange gelatinous substance issues from the crevice left by the moonbeam.  It climbs out and, piling upon itself, forms the visage of a female drow.  She cocks her head at the party.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As more goo issues forth from the floor, more and more drow form, until six lithe, angry drow warriors are sneering at the four heroes.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can see a thin tendril of something connecting all of the drow together.  Also, now they're very solid, they don't seem to be gelatinous any longer.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(are they in the moonbeam still?</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“State your purpose or begone. It will happen one way or another...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Let's get into initiative then!!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>EL1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (2) + 3 = <code>5</code>.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, dripping with dew, feels a drop plop from his mop down on top of his crop. He takes it in between the thumb and forefinger of his left hands and beckons the moonbeam to invoke the tides!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 6 iterations, DC 14...</p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (12) + 3 = </p><p>1d20 (4) + 3 = </p><p>1d20 (13) + 3 = </p><p>1d20 (13) + 3 = </p><p>3 successes, 62 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter watches as the water washes over the 'drow'.  A few fade away into nothingness, then they turn to the red ooze again.  It merges into the other forms, making the others grow larger.  Three very muscled drow now look down at you and smile.  As one, in a grating, nails-against-the-chalkboard voice, "Finally.  We have someones to play with us."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell, accept a copy of Jaecob Muhlen? (Type yes/no)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>yes</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Copied Jaecob Muhlen to Maouelue/Dieter's storage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob's terror at the situation starts to give way to a roiling fury. The unholy vestiges of his father's hubris have undone what should have otherwise been a peaceful and noble existence. That the sickness is perpetuated in his brother and that the strings of that fate have led him here, to the literal brink of the abyss is too much, it was bound to boil over at some point...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His eyes bulge red as his rage overtakes him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Real Runemark rages forward, a guttural string of profanities spewing forth in hoarse shouts as he unsheathes his shortsword, channeling all of his repressed anger into the taunting Drow. Gone is the fear, gone is the acquiescence. Dieter's words have stirred him to take control of his own fate.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Take that you fucking bastards! I'll kill the lot of you!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Muhlen swipes through one and red goo spurts from it.  They all react in pain!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Eat the shit that you are, fiend!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It lets out a long screech as the remaining goo coalesces into the last remaining drow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Jaecob revel in their destruction of the monster!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco ruffles his tentacles, wings, and various other appendages as he lurches in to get a <i>taste</i> of the action.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Time to burn."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"One way or another..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacles reach out to strike at the mess, just as the fire starts pouring from Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco tries to find the thing's brain, but cannot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come on then, let's have it!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The shell shocked snail slaps out with a frenzied overkill of tentacles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last eyestalk hits, the goo is flung <i>everywhere</i>, and a long, sad, sighing shriek can be heard, slowly fading away into nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well done team! We may just get out of this yet!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[2,000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now Flayco....where did you put that <i>ball?</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group regains their composure, two things are very much clear to everyone.  First, the miasma is almost completely depleted.  Second, the disc is about to fall.  Third, there is <i>a lot</i> more noise now coming from the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Flayco, think you could fly over there and bring that disc back here? It's like a ball, but flat...and floating over a pit of miasma..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><s>Flayco takes some time, fakes out a couple times and tries some running starts.  Jaecob gets on the other side, just to be safe.  Finally, the young dragon monster gets a good running start...  and jumps...</s></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter holds out the large staff to Jaecob, and together they help span the deadly pit.  The miasma is almost completely gone now, the disc is hovering just a few inches off of the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco hops on and starts traversing.  Halfway over, he gets the disc in his tentacles and continues crossing towards Jaecob.  Dieter, however, looks down and sees red eyes looking back and him.  The staff wavers...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Careful there now lads!" The leverage of the wyrmling on the end of the staff tests the Druid's strength as his eyes peer downward.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The staff stays put as the wyrmling snatches the disc, takes one look down, and bolts to Jaecob's side.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco immediately spits the disc on the ground, as if it burned him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter strokes the grotesque, yet oddly cuddly, crossbreed lovingly. "You did good there boy, reaaaal good!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks over at Shelli, who seems a bit jealous of the attention.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And Shelli! You <i>bashed</i> that other monstrosity! Great job the lot of you!" He caresses her shell with the back of his hand, running his nails across the gaps in her ridges of spikes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The growing family pulls in close and inspects the disc while Jaecob, still enraged, huffs and puffs and looks down at the remainder inside the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Lmao</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>just saw that)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The miasma evaporates as the disc moves from the top.  Jaecob peers into the darkness.  Many sets of red eyes stare back at him, from the deep recesses.  Could it be rats?  Fey creatures?  The abyssal monsters he fears most?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He buckles down and fights his fear, but the roiling blackness shows him no more...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter closes his eyes, taps into his druidic roots, finds the flow.  The water in his mind washes over him, turns to dust and grit as a small child grabs him by the hand, leads him to an ancient pyramid somewhere amidst massive sand dunes.  They walk through the massive entry way, make their way deep, deeper into the darkening rooms.  Finally, the last room has a shaft of light illuminating a small disc on a plinth.  The disc that Dieter is holding now.  Instantly, as his mind-self reaches out and touches the object, both entities are flooded with ancient knowledge about the inescapably unique artifact...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter grasps the object a burst of low frequency energy seems to blast inward, momentarily silencing the ambience around him. He both feels and hears a static sizzle lingering in the air around him as he rebounds back into the full sonic plane. Immediately, he turns to Flayco and casts a careworn look in his direction, fearing the worst.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Annulus generates a continuous catapsi (nullified psionic field) effect within a 30-foot-radius of the wielder.</p><p>The wielder gains a +4 bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals psionic damage.</p><p>Once per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action.  (Redirects psionic damage back onto the attacker.)</p><p>As a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to dimensional anchor that affects all psionic-based creatures in a 50-foot radius.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, seeing that his pup is ok, examines the disc deeply. “Yes. Yeeeeeessssss.” He mutters under his breath.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What’s down there Jaecob?”, He sidles up to the edge.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You... ah..."  He looks gravely at you.  "You don't want to know."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tremendous sucking sounds start up from the depths, as if some lumbering creature were slinking up the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks deep into the pit.  With his newfound weapon, he is feeling confident.  Ready to tackle <i>anything</i> that might threaten his family.  Jaecob lights a torch quickly, needing to see better.  What they see is a black pile of ooze, covered in red eyes and viscous looking mouths, using it's black tentacles to reach and push itself up the sides of the pit.  It's slowly coming up, but it just might be gaining some momentum.  The mouths are all saying something, all at the same time.  Gibbering, shouting, cursing, whispering, all happening at the same time.  Some laugh, and high-pitched cackling echoes throughout the area.  Worse yet, the eyes seems to be locked onto the now lit torch.  A roar/hiss/groan/laugh screams out at the duo.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ready for the bonfire?” Dieter questions his companions with a wink.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He sends the great ball of fire down into the hole of goo.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jar on begins pelting magic stones down at the fiend below.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The ball of flame sears the side of the monstrous gibbering mouther, still about 60 feet below the group.  It tears a section off the creature as it continues to move, swiftly now, up the sides of the pit.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flames retract back to the beast, searing it again.  Although the monstrosity is massive, it seems very dexterous and avoids a good amount of the damage.  The mouths, eyes, ooze is getting closer.  It moves within 30 feet of the group now.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Taking it's extended dash action, it will move another 20 feet, just to the mouth of the pit.  Everyone can now see the disgusting sight of the creature.  It appears bodies of drow, illithid, and a myriad of other denizens of the underdark were boiled down and reassembled, poorly, into a mass of flesh, muscles, and viscous liquid.  The thing roils around, but seems to have appendages it can manifest at will.  Constant chattering and gibbering come from it, causing all of the party to get confused, the voices rattling around in your heads.  As it gets closer, you all can see the stone of the pit is quickly turning soft, mushy.  </p><p>(Mechanics - Wisdom save at the start of each turn, DC 10.  If you fail, roll a d8.

<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, his rage having dwindled in the interim while he assisted with the Annulus, breathes heavily, wiping streams of sweat from his once-again furrowed brow. The tingling of iron on his tongue still fresh from the bloodlust. He lunges at the grotesque giant and slashes deeply with his sword!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Back to hell! Bugger off you filth!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He darts back 20 toward the dais while the creature is stunned.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco spews forth a great stream of acid into the many muddled faces of the grotesque blob, then preens as he looks up at Dieter adoringly, a mass of slimy tentacles and wings flapping about excitedly.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter continues pummeling the fiend with fire, he leaves the flaming sphere lingering on top of it.

<div class="character-1"><p>Fire has nearly immolated the monster.  Melted flesh, bone, and ichor slough off the being in waves, making the place stink like a garbage fire.  On top of that, the voices are now rebounding around the room, making it even harder to concentrate on the task at hand - putting this thing out of it's clearly miserable existence.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The many eyes look back and forth between the party members.   Several mouths gape, some scream, some cry.  Some melt off in slow agony.  The thing tries to straighten itself out, towering over Jaecob.  Several mouths lick grotesque lips.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>He stands there, looking ragged, not quite knowing how this has happened. He feels....</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Slightly less stupid than he thought for a fleeting moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gloop wends around Jaecob's attacks, several of the mouths give him hell for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The young draconic flayer purrs a soft, deadly note. The eyes, and mouths, and tentacles all lock on to the ooze, then seem to contract as one.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco lets out an ear shattering screech of frustration.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It warbles through the tentacles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hccckkkksssssssstiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeecccchkkkk!!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The rest of the party shields their ears in a recoiling wave.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes in a deep breath and gathers his mental faculties.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He feels perfectly collected and in tune with the growing sense of acceptance of his role as the thin grey line between the two sides of light and dark.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter's conscience is unblinking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Deleter delivers the drool its demise.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Target g1 not found.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Smoke seems to emanate from Dieter's nostrils as he balances the frustration inside him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli is startled at having her own type of brilliance shined back upon her. She retreats into her shell.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He spits on the beast then slinks back down onto the wall, and gasping.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bubbling pile of ooze is now bits and blobs around the room.  The effects of it's various voices and blinding spittle recede.  The room becomes quiet.  Silent as the grave.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[3,100 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco is having a jolly old romp of excitement between the two, making all sorts of squelching flapping noises. Shelli, hearing a thrum of revelry, takes a tentative peek out of her shell, which rapidly accelerates, well...as rapidly as a Flail Snail can....into a bobbing lurch that can only be interpreted as ecstasy.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Somewhere in the back of Dieter's mind, he could swear he hears a horn fanfare....</i></p><p><i>...It's probably nothing...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Reeling in the crew, Dieter calls for calm, then directs everyone over to the pit. They all look down at the darkness. Dieter brings over what remains of the flaming sphere and lets it fall down the hole, watching as its light illuminates all it passes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shadows are cast as the sphere shrinks slightly, passes by the group, and heads down the hole in the middle of the room.  Immediately, the crew sees flotsam of the creature clinging to the sides all the way down.  The sphere travels thirty feet, forty feet, it still continues on.  The sides farther down seem less disgusting, and Dieter and Jaecob can almost make out flagstones.  The sphere continues down, down, it becomes a pinpoint of light no longer under the control of Dieter.  There is stays, but the group is unsure whether it is at the bottom, or just disconnected from the druid.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, the flame <i>winks</i> out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls out four bottles from his pack. He hands the promised last bottle of Golden Dragon Ale to Jaecob. </p><p></p><p>"Here,  you deserve this, <i>brother.</i>"</p><p></p><p>To Shelli, he pours out the contents of the bottle of Ver-poo-th.</p><p></p><p>"You were stunning, Shelli."</p><p></p><p>For Flayco, he offers up a bottle of Bubblegut Ale.</p><p></p><p>"Here, you've earned your fun. Go play around with your acid breath!"</p><p></p><p>He then pulls out the stopper on the remaining bottle of Gnomish whiskey.</p><p></p><p>"Now one for Doctor Druid."</p><p></p><p>He takes a stiff draught off the bottle, resolute not to flinch at the rubbing alcohol portion.</p><p></p><p>"You beautiful beasts...."</p><p></p><p><i>He turns and looks at the cryptex.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite make out the sequencing of the cryptex.  The book made it sound pretty simple, but looking at it now, it's anything but.  He can, however, touch the spinning columns and turn them without any of the adverse effects referenced by Lord Muhlen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes some time to go back over Muhlen’s notes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He deliberates over the spindles, examining each and every glyph upon them, searching for the resonances Muhlen referred to.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(How about this...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The journal mentions that Muhlen found the first symbol. Can Dieter any indication of which it was? Is there any chance of gleaning more from these incoherent writings? There is an itching curiosity to find more clues. How did Muhlen</i> </p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob looks at the druid and takes the book, hesitantly.  He starts pouring over the writings, getting deeper and deeper into it as the time goes on. (Do you have any magics that could aid him?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Runemark stands up, excitedly, motioning to Dieter.  "Hey, I think I have it!  Here, let me check.  Is it safe?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ha! Safe!...Pardon my hearty guffaw there Jaecob, but when's the last time you felt <i>safe</i>... But I saw that blood in your eyes today. Aren't you <i>ready to know what your old man was after?</i> Wouldn't it be sweet to beat your brother to it? <i>If only to burn it all down...</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But I've got the Annulus. You should be safe from madness at the least."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter adds in what he hopes is a convincing tone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Feeling bolstered, he says, "Okay.  Here goes!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob deftly rolls the columns, looking at the book for reference.  The first clicks into place, then the second and third.  He looks strained, checking with Dieter to make sure he's still there.  Then, hands shaking slightly, turns the last column.  It clicks into place and stone starts grinding behind the western wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here...for your nerves.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter hands him the remainder of the Gnomish Whiskey for a job well done.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He tips it up while watching the wall closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Behind the cylinder, an invisible seal opens in the wall, opening a chamber behind it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid peers curiously at the opening door, his eye being pulled away momentarily by Flayco, whose bubble-gut acid spasms seemed to be coming now to a squelching, splattering, sizzling finale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli happily schlurps up the cherry poo goo and bleats.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His attention turns back to the wall at hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Stone grinds against stone, but no dust is made.  It seems this craftsmanship is very high end.  The smell is the first thing the group notices.  It is tangy, rotten, with notes of brine and the sea.  The irregularly shaped room is lined with tables and bookshelves.  A magical lamp crackles to life to illuminate a truly grizzly scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the table is an illithid, dead, in mid-post mortem.  It's chest has an incision down to his waist, the skin is splayed open and tacked to the table, presenting the innards of the creature.  The table beyond the operating bench is filled with gadgets and tools, all caked in dried blood and gristle.  Several books are opened on the surrounding shelving, including one standing open on a high stand close to the operation.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Stifling a retch, the two humans cover their faces with whatever means they can as they enter. Dieter sets a flame outside the door to draw out and purify the sickly air. Immediately Dieter begins looking for an internal door mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brushes a bit of residual goo off his shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the left side of the interior wall of the chamber, Dieter sees clearly a stone button trying to blend into the stone.  Just underneath that is a wooden switch, prominently stationed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I know it’s not much, but it’s home for now. Let’s close this up and take a rest while we sort through these tomes.” Dieter makes to close the outer door to the pit chamber and to seal the cryptex door using the hidden stone button, once they’ve aired things out as best they can that is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone button is pushed, the doors shut.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The magical light goes out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter moves his solemn, solitary flame into the room as the doors close. He looks over the stacks of books and takes a choice few. </p><p></p><p>“Get comfortable, it’s going to be a long...whatever bloody time of day it is...”</p><p></p><p>He hands a few books to Jaecob and passes around the balance of the rations to the beleaguered crew, then draws up a “cozy” corner by the fire. </p><p></p><p><i>I wonder where the Elf is...</i></p><p><i>No doubt he would</i> love <i>to set his academic mind to work in the midst all this lore.</i></p><p></p><p>He lets loose the last bit of his prophylactic magic, then resigns himself to the time that had been opened before the vivisection.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He settles in for a long, restful read.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sister?" Bellatrix says, incredulously.  "You're supposed to be at home.  In bed, resting!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"BAH," the crone spits.  "There's adventure afoot, and I mean to see to it that none of you break your gods-damned necks!"  She hobbles in on a gnarled cane/staff and immediately ventures towards the herbalism table.  Setting her things down hastily, she starts her brewing, getting items and preparing bottles and vials.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks dumbfounded at the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman yells over her shoulder, "'Bout time I did something <i>useful</i>!  Been wastin' away all these years.  Feel like a new woman!  We gotta get going, though, if we're going to be gettin' anywhere useful.  Gods, woman," she says to Bellatrix, "Don't you have a cauldron of healing potion ready <i>at alll times</i>?  What have I always said!  Gods!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She <i>cackles</i> from the corner, good naturedly but with an edge to it, for sure.  "Never enough, that's what they say!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Small crackles and pops start emanating from the cauldron.  The woman says, "Don't mind me, get along with your business.  I'll be ready by the time you's are ready to get-along!  Aheh!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, I would like to come back to the barrrow by an alternate route. Let us traverse what we may of the rift along the way. Is there aught we should know before heading into the forest?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't suggest going into the rift.  Or travelling along it, either.  Bound to be traversed by Runemark men.  Best way I can see is stealing through this forest.  It's not the safest route, but it might be the most direct.  You want to get back to near the place we met, yes?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, you’re my guide from here to there as far as I’m concerned. I’ll follow your lead. Long have I wished to see the fabled woods of my kin.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course, there is...  one...  other way."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Especially if you want to see kin."  He gets a faraway look, as if he's a million miles away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s eyes glisten with starlight as he stares in anticipation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran comes back to himself, coughs, and grips the back of his neck with his hand.  "I.."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't like talking about it, much.  Reminds me of..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Better times.  But some time ago, I was a part of a group that was charged with protecting a mythallar.  I was given the powers of a walker.  Gods, I haven't used them in forever.  But I might be able to remember how.  Could take us to a separate plane, maybe even the feywild.  We could go to the barrow, then planeshift back.  Might even meet some eladrin in the process."   He looks extremely embarrassed to be speaking about any of this.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman has stopped her work and is gawking at the ranger.  So are the others, as if Daran is some deified being.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the Eladarin...”, Maouelue mutters in a hushed whisper.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Just another option.  I'm fine with any way we go."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue thinks back to what drew him here in the first place. A view of his final encounter with Shi’Vandos begins to coalesce in his mind’s eye...</p><p></p><p><i>His old master, ever patient with the impetuousness of youth, yet ever watchful, glances over at his young charge, lost in his studies. As always Maouelue sits there hunched over his studies of ancient lore and language, his back to the window and the distracting echoes of his cohort frolicking out in the midsummer sun. He uses the latter instead to illuminate his texts late into the day.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Shi’Vandos knows that drive, that yearning for something greater than oneself, and nowhere could be more compelling than these old stories. Yet the stories themselves were all an illusion if one never got out of the tower. Yes, this land of Faerun is fabled beyond all, but as the hours in the tower grow long the flower of the power wanes.</i></p><p></p><p><i>“Maouleue,” the elder starts, “Come now, the time for reading today is done.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>The young elf looks up imploringly from his book, glancing back at the last unread page.</i></p><p></p><p><i>The master stifles a chuckle and nods. “Yes, you can finish it.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>Relieved, Maouleue buries himself back in and furiously scans over the final words, taking a long deep breath as he closes the tome’s back cover and holds it between his hands. He rises slowly and ritually restores the book to its place on the shelf.</i></p><p></p><p>“It is time we put all of this knowledge you are so keen to accumulate to use. Come, follow me to the observatory, I must show you something.”</p><p></p><p><i>“Of course, master.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>Shi’vandos leads him solemnly down a series of ornate corridors lined with oil paintings of old masters come and gone, old glorious deeds immortalized in radiant colors, the intricate white lattice work of the elves who built this wing of the academy lining the walls and letting a moiré of light shine in on the otherwise unlit space.</i></p><p></p><p><i>They take a right turn at the end of the long hall and Shi’vandos pulls a thin lever recessed into a nook.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A door to a long winding stair opens up and the Master defers to his pupil.</i></p><p></p><p><i>”Some things you must see first for yourself.”, he states stoically.</i></p><p></p><p><i>Maoulue looks deep into his eyes, questioning, yet obedient. He turns and walks apprehensively up and around and out of view.</i></p><p></p><p><i>“Yes, you must see for yourself what I cannot bear to tell you. Not until...you have had time to let the truth of what must be done arise from your own mind.”</i></p><p></p><p><i>He waits there, patient, knowing, for an hour, listening all the while. Then he hears it, the cry of shock and agony that he knows only too well himself. He lets out a breath that perhaps he had been holding the whole time, and follows his pupil’s ascent.</i></p><p></p><p>“<i>Yes, my shining star, you have a half brother...my...other son. It is time you met him...but I am...no longer able to go that way. It is time you seek him out, and bring to him these words I would have him hear, before it is too late...”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>”Master? I did not hear you come in...</i>”</p><p></p><p>Maoulue’s conscience begins to fade back into view, he pushes against the sensation of the dark hovel returning, desperate for answers to the questions he should have asked that day, and the important words he has now forgotten...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes, I will follow you through the plane of the Feywild. If my studies be accurate and my intuition be true, there is someone there with whom I am most anxious to speak.”</p><p></p><p>“Vam, Heston, I fear my hours with you are always too short and filled with terrible tidings and tasks, yet your roles in this may now just prove the fate of these lands. Get ye hence to Longsaddle and raise what rabble you can, though if you can muster brick and crenelation, the all the better! We will need loyalty above all. Let us each swear now here upon the light of the lost that we shall prevail amidst the darkness and never despair. Let us meet on the field nigh the dark citadel ere the holy light wanes and stake our standards of truth deep in the soil, letting our banners fly to the wind off the Trackless Sea.”</p><p></p><p>With this, he traces a frozen sigil in the air, one of peace, resolution and above all, balance. He nods at the group and turns his gaze to the sisters of the craft. </p><p></p><p>“I would beg no further favor of you two, yet I welcome whatever aid our cause can afford. We now await your blessings as the light of the lands dwindles.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam and Heston nod.  "Until we meet at the Citadel, Master Mage."  Heston gives a very formal bow, Vam puts his arm out for a warrior's arm-shake.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue extends his arm to receive the gesture and bows back to the two solemnly and with the respect that is due their loyal following. </p><p></p><p>“Lady Bellatrix, are you ready?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women wait patiently for the men to say goodbye to Maouelue and Dieter, then say goodbye themselves.  After Vam and Heston leave, the old lady turns back to her work, Bellatrix goes to help.  The old woman says to her sister (but loud enough for all to hear), "It's been a while since I've seen it, but I think we're in the presence of honest-to-gods <i>ta'veren</i>, Bella."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>OK, ending...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two women gather all of their progress into a few side satchels, and hands one out to each member.  Bellatrix says, "Inside these are two potions of healing, one standard and one greater.  A potion of invisibility, a potion of water-breathing, and two potions of fire resistance.  I'm not sure what else we need, so I'm brining along all I can to help make more on our way."  As she hands a bag to Maouelue, she blushes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Thank you <i>dear Bellatrix</i>”, He bows deeply.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman cackles a bit, and shuffles off muttering to herself.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran is searching in his pack.  He brings out a strange metal symbol or device of some sort.  He arranges it in the center of the room, moves furniture and clears a space.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue focuses all his attentions on the object, on the precipice of the realm of which til now he had only read in old musty tomes alone in a tower leagues away, eras away. He waits with bated soul.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I should tell you all, before we start on this path, the Feywild...  Well, time there is different.  It'll seem like time is passing normally.  But when we get back, it could be seconds, minutes, hours...  even years off.  I know I mentioned it as an option, and I don't have anything here worth living or dying for.  But you all might.  Just wanted to put everything on the table with what we're about to do."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I am ready.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Belltrix grabs Maouelue's hand.  "I am ready."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Giggling, the old woman grabs Bellatrix's hand.  "I'm ready, too!"  She holds out a hand for Daran.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How about you, Daran?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shouldering his pack, he stands, grasps the other's hands.   He closes his eyes and the room starts spinning around them.  It blurs as the object in the middle of the group shines a bright yellow.  The floor falls away, the walls fall away, Daran opens his eyes.   Black pools look out from his sockets.  He raises his head, mouthing words unheard.  Winds still spin around the group.  Vaguely, colors come back to the void.  Beautiful pinks and purples mix with lush and vibrant greens and yellows.  Dark brown woods come into view.  Interspersed, violet flowers that look mixed with fireworks and glitter about in the forest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Birds tweet in the trees, random noises indicate small woodland creatures scurry underfoot and overhead.  It smells of fresh soil and a cool breeze plays throughout the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran takes a deep breath and smiles.  Bellatrix and the old woman do the same.  They all look around, taking in their new surroundings.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue fairly swoons as the pages of his devotion are spread out, in the flesh, all around him. The chroma of colors swirls into his eyes and stirs deep chords within this spirit. He stumbles slightly over to Daran and falls into a weighty hug that turns into spurts of sobbing. </p><p></p><p>“The beauty....it’s more than i ever imagined...listen to the song of the birds! I....I...”</p><p></p><p>Words fail the overwhelmed elf.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran pats Mao's back.  "I know.  I know."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They de-embrace, still looking at their surroundings, taking it all in.  The sisters are doing the same.  Daran eventually picks up the object from the ground and, putting it in his pack, picks out something else and starts walking in a wide circle around the group, holding the item out before him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s academic mind kicks in. He studied Daran’s movements with a trained eye, determined to glean everything he can from this experience.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran notices Maouelue intently watching him.  He says, not turning away from his circling, "The Feywild is one of two planes that directly overlap the material plane.  Natural landmarks mimic themselves across these veils, as do cities and even people, sometimes.  This compass is a way for me to get my bearings down.  If I'm to lead us to where we need to be, I need to be as close to where we first met in the material plane.  Then we can cross back.  If we do so before, who knows where we might end up."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, and be wary of the foods here.  Might be best if I check them first."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Birds chirp, leaves scuttle.  The late-evening sun streams through the trees casting rays of light throughout.  It is utter bliss for Maouelue, who feels he has returned home.  Daran nods, looks off in a direction East/SE, scanning through the trees.  Moments later, satisfied with his assessment, he shoulders his pack and says, "Are we ready to go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes,” Maouelue says, bringing himself around. “It is time we were on our way.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Not but five steps into the long trek, four figures descend down from the high tree boughs.  Unheard, unseen until just now, these elves have pale white skin, almost like it is frosted over.  Their long hair is bluish white, tied back by intricate baubles that look to be glass or ice.   Their clothes are dark blues and whites, and with the surrounding woods, take on a greenish tint as well.  They all hold strong looking, but delicately beautiful bows.  Two of them, in the rear of the foursome, have lethal looking arrows nocked.  The other two stare daggers at Daran and Maouelue respectively.  In a deeply sonorous, mournful tone, an androgynous looking one closest to the party steps forward, bow at their side, and says, "You are trespassing in our home, the Glimmerwood.  As you do not seem to be from Faerie, you will have to explain yourselves.  It is unwise to be here without a winter eladrin scout."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s mind races back too all the books he ever read on the Eldarin, frantically trying to think of something that would save them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He searches Daran pleadingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran holds his hands out. "Please accept our deepest apologies.  My name is Daran Edermath, son of Yanoros Edermath, of the Imperios Ralohorn bloodline.  I am a Horizon Walker, one of the called protectors of Myth Evereska.  These here are under my safeguard.  We are traversing the Feywild in hopes to defeat a newly arrived doom to Faerun.  There is much need for us to make haste through your realm, I apologize sincerely for the intrusion."</p><p>(Did Mao want to add anything?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>For once, Maouleue is speechless.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elves look between each other, then size up the group again.  The lead elf raises his arm, moves it slightly behind him.  They say, "Cruiver, Otirnis, lower your bows."  Without any of them taking their eyes off you, their weapons are lowered.  </p><p>"Hear this, Master Protector of Myth Evereska, you are not welcome here.  This not your home.  Maybe the other one with you could stay if he truly wanted.  But know this - even though you have the capability of coming here, you have neither the authority or welcome to be in Faerie.  We will walk you to the closest crossing.  There you must leave our lands."  The lead two turn to move further into the forest, the other two are waiting for you to pass to take up the rear.  Daran looks sadly at Maouelue.  Softly, he says, "Sorry Maouelue.  Not the best reception for your first visit here."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Errrm, ah well met ancient brethren. I pray not be too presumptuous and I fully understand your desire to defend your lands. But we are here to quell a darkness that may yet reach its unrest into your domain. Surely your lord would hear fair warning! Let not old prejudices cast aside the cords of reason! Come, see our cause is just. I swear it by the star of my Master Shi’Vandos.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The leader stops abruptly.  His companions do as well, the rear guard at attention.  The bows are drawn but not up.  The leader turns their head so that their voice can be heard behind them.  "I understand your need.  Both of our worlds have troubles, 'doom' to use a phrase.  It is not foreign to us.  I am sure you would have us lead you to your way point.  You may even want to petition one of our noble houses, or one of the Queens even.  However, any of these actions would be folly.  You are outsiders, as we would be in your world.  We know how outsiders are treated in your Faerun.  I believe we are treating you much to the positive by allowing you to return to your home.  Do you disagree, cousin elf?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tension is offset somewhat by the beautiful atmosphere.  Each of the pale elves, however, is a taut bundle of muscle and wariness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's impetuous outburst is quelled. He opens his mouth to speak in retort, but words and courage fail him in light of this rebuke. All he can muster is, "And so it goes." He cows his head and treads on in captivity, saddened slightly at the difference between fancy and reality.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader nods, starts back to walking.  The octet moves N, away from their target.  Daran looks beaten, the women look worried.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud <i>crack</i> sounds from the forest path in front of the group.  The leader puts their fist up to halt everyone.  No one makes a sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Hand signals move back and forth between the elves.  The rear guard moves forward on the path, bows drawn and aimed ahead of them.  Towards the sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A series of loud grunts issue forth from the glade just ahead, which is obscured by the trees as well as a small rise in the forest floor.  Daran whispers to himself, but Maouelue can catch it.  "Good place for an ambush..."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Two separate tree trunks, 10ft in diameter, come flying through the forest from beyond the rise.  The two lead elves checking out the noise catch the full brunt force of the attack, while the leader and Daran are just able to move out of the way at the last minute.  Maouelue's group jumps into the brush at the side of the forest path, while the other elves dodge and try to recover their friends as best they can.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The women are scraped up, and Daran immediately attends to their wounds.  The Eladrin revive their friends, who were knocked prone, one still looks completely out for the count.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunderous footfalls can be heard coming down the path toward the groups.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, thinking quickly, offers the net of invisibility to Daran for the Sisters.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman looks at the net oddly, then smiles wide.  She grabs it, tosses it around herself and Bellatrix, and the women disappear from sight.  Daran apprears taken aback for a moment, but then the thudding stops and he turns to see, 80 feet up the path...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Four massive, 15ft tall giants, grotesquely disfigured, emerge from the forest.  They see the scattered group and start chortling.  "Look, fellas," one says in a deep, lethargic drawl.  "We got ourselves some morsels."  The foursome start laughing and hoisting their clubs.  Slowly, they start advancing towards their prey.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Are we running?" he asks Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us kite them out. Surely us elves are fleeter of foot than these beasts! We’ll run them ragged!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“On second thought!...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The giants bowl into the wood, knocking down saplings and revving up.  Their stares seem to unnerve some of the other elves.  The leader and the one on the verge of being knocked out seem effected most.  Suddenly, boils start breaking out all of the two elves's bodies!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Groups cannot cast spells.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue’s mind whirls at all that has happened in what seems like the last minute. He half wonders if Daran’s proclamations about fey time are in action as they speak. He steadies himself, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. He breathes a cold stream onto it, watching it crystallize and grow, then calls to the icy winds of the north mountains, bringing down a heavy blast of snow!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tough bastards, eh?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran and Bellatrix look at Maouelue and nod.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix surveys the scene, it’s a fearsome sight, the four hulking giants leering and approaching, the fallen Eldarin...she doesn’t like to show this side of herself, but there is nothing else for it now. She steps up and begins to speak in a low guttural tongue. The words echo strangely off the fae woods as if they don’t belong here...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A dark circle forms just behind the the group of giants, a crimson marks scattered across the center. Black beams erupt up out of the runic circle as the shapes appear.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The blood witch returns none of the presumably gawking stares.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin turn their heads to the group, trying to see just who these people are!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She leads the group back about 30 feet from the giants, tugging at the awestruck Maouleue who seems to have forgotten his feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran makes a move to follow, then looks back at the struggling eladrin...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Bellatrix shuffles the group westward, she pulls out a decrepit looking eyeball. The same dark language leaves her lips in a trail of red mist. An inverted star wraps itself around the newt’s sphere and shoots out toward the eyes of the last giant in line.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran runs over to the passed out eladrin, fires at the closest giant, and asks the eladrin leader, "How can I help?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader shouts, "Cierean, take him away!  You, half elf.  Help us fight!!"</p><p>An eladrin grabs the prone elf and disappears.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"><p>WI3 removed from combat.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The others grab Daran by the shirt and drag him along with them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue looks up at the unfolding scene, desperation seems to mount with each passing second, yet a stout defense they would make. For a moment the sight of the giants, drenched in snow, reminds him of the vault back in Muhlen Manor. The first revelation of the frosty avatar of giant magic, the icy ambitions of the Lord himself. Here he stands clad in these garments. He dons the helmet that he laid out at the manor, draws out his frozen sword and sends out any icy beam from the tip of the sword, straight at the hexed giant!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>One of Maouelue's balls go blue, then he darts back east toward the main giant pack.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The blood witch focuses in on her prey.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her first beam hits expertly, but then her dark powers begin to tilt and she send her fel beams wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Nevertheless, she regains her feet with a Blood Witch Dance and sends the hexed creature walking away from Daran, West into the third Giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blood witch's voice gets inside the disgusting giant's mind.  Not only does he move toward his compatriot, he attacks him!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Bellatrix’s dance comes to an end, she seems to come back to her more reclusive self for a moment, overwhelmed by her own display of power.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran screams as he unleashes against the giant!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The third giant strikes down with it's greatclub, making a dent in it's cohort.  As it fells it's friend, it blinks, not quite knowing what has happened.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue channels another blue-white bolt from his sword, sending it at the giant engaged with Bellatrix.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue dashes a bit further back into the woods to the North.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bella hears the weeping heartstrings coming from her Northeast but does not look to see the source. Instead she rounds on her new prey.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The dark dance begins again, the sight of the descending giant bringing Bella's blood back to a boil.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She twists its feeble mind, whispering its will away after a willo-the-wisp in the wavering woods.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the fetid creature lurches away, she strikes out hard with her blade in hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She draws in her breath, feeding on the rush of necrotic blood searing out of the staggered mass. Blast after blast sears in a sickly red-black-green beam toward the failing giant's back.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As her last beam gets away from her, she spits black liquid into the fey soil, sneering canines now poking out of her furious face.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She dashes off to the Northeast, tucking behind a tall tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran makes a couple quick slashes at the giant, then, in a strange move, jumps quickly...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In an amazingly deft move, the half-elf hops on the creatures arm, moves to it's head, and steadiest himself atop the fiend!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gets knocked around a bit, but stays clinging to the beast!</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Target f03 not found.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maoulue begins to make a series of movements in a flash as the giant slams his club into the tree behind which Bellatrix is hiding. He taps his amulet against his shield, a faint glimmer transferring to it in the process. Maouelue seems to swell with vigor as this happens, then he dashes forward at the lumbering giant. He stows his frosty blue sword and pulls out a deadly mace, bringing it down hard at the creature.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The off-weighted mage misses spectacularly, his delusions of parchment grandeur apparently getting the better of him in the Feywild.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He rubs another frosty ball in self-pity.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"There there Mao, we'll warm those up soon enough," the witch smirks as she watches the "tel'varen" squirm.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her attention returns to her foe.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her indulgent distraction shows as her dark beam seems almost thinned out by her levity....or was it something else?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She comes back to her senses, a different kind of blood boiling in her face now.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her last beam pierces through the gap in the giants loins, just below a painful potential.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flustered now, she hastily tries to send the infuriating thing into the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It drives straight into the tree, wondering only after why the hell it's doing so.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix flees back now, the hem of her robes brushing Maouelue slightly as she passes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran drives his swords down into the giant's back, trying to sever something, anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gets shellacked by the greatclub and falls from the monster's back.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Hearing the sickening crunch from afar, Maouelue looks over and sees his receding companion, "DARAAAAN!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The female eladrin moves to stand over the fallen Daran, striking out with her sword!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The metal mage looks over at Bellatrix sweeping past him, the gazes back at the giant, whispering softly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The life and death matter at hand seems to pull at the opposite energies of the life cleric and the blood witch, something about being out here in the woods, in the feywild.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He shuffles over toward the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The flustered witch sees the vulnerable elf, metal clad and cowering, then stands tall against the advance of the giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She lays into the giant hoping beyond hope to save her...friend.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Again, her concentration swirls wildly out of control as her heartblood is destabilized.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her eyes look over at Maouelue in confused wonder and apprehension.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the blast floats past the giant, suddenly it disappears!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She desperately channels her dance again, hoping beyond hope...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's eyes go wide with wonder, then as he hears Bellatrix's call, he readies his mace, waiting for the sound of the giant crashing toward the tree.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue cowers closer to the tree now, fearful for his life.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix moves a little further Northwest to try and draw the Giant's ire away from the cowering mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran rises, says something low to the elf in front of him.  Then, with another acrobatic move, rolls away to the north...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He stows his swords in one go, brings his bow up, and fires at the...  wait, it was just there.  He turns back and fires at the closest one.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The greatclub swaths through the air, catching an unaware Bellatrix in the shoulder.  She topples, falling prone.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The second eladrin gets pummeled with the club...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But she stays on her feet.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her two arm attack flails, just nicks the giant.  One of her arms looks broken.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Stay away from her!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The out-of-sorts and out-of-place elf find hims<i>elf</i> locked in melee combat with the giant. He valiantly chases after the invisible, yet lumbering, assailant.</p><p></p><p>"You will not harm her!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He swings wildly, but finds nothing, perhaps he was off by one footfall or more...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flabbergasted, he looks askance at the giant-crushed foliage around him, wondering what magics are at play here that would have him so unsure of foot.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bellatrix locks on to the sound of the greatclub's followthrough as she steadies herself from the blow. She pelts blast after blast of hot fire back at the wilting giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her final strike lands true in the nethers of the unwitting creature, laying it low.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As the giant crashes to the ground, the Blood Witch sends her hex flying over to the feeble giant waning on the far reach of the battle, then sends another fiery ray chasing after it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The witch spits blood at the nearest fallen giant.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Effect Hex removed from FO3.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bolt after bolt of fire flies past the healthiest of the remaining giants.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She ends her turn in a swirling of emotion that she is not used to embodying anymore. Not since...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Enough of this."  Daran drops his bow and draws out his two scimitars dramatically.  Seeing the closest giant almost completely down, he strikes out at him with one sword, while spinning and attacking the bottom half of the other in combat with the eladrin leader.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lone giant, seeing his brethren falling around him...  (1-fights, 2-flees)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He drops his club and starts running the way he originally came, N.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The initial hit as it's leaving doesn't hit him.  The leader falls to his knee, panting.  "Finish him off!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran manages to get him as he runs by, but the eladrin's arrow flies wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maoulue, emboldened by the falling giants all around, dashes toward the final foe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pulls the mace up overhead with all his might.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mace slams into the giant's leg, making far less of an impression than Maoulue has made a scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Balls ice over once again....</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Bella turns her deathly stare to the last of the giantkin. Once again fel beams emanate from her fingertips to the doomed lifeform in front of her.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She cackles as the giant's life force crackles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now dance for me just like your fallen friends."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She attempts to walk this one into the nearest tree as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He does, and hit it.  Hard.  But he has a really hard head.  Deformed, for sure.  But still hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sprints after the monstrosity.  Seeing it stop and then run directly at the tree, the half-elf gets an idea...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps on a branch and uses it to crawl up the thing's back.  It doesn't look particularly pretty, but it gets the job done.  Standing on the beast's back, Daran tries to sever it's spine.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It doesn't find spine, but it finds an artery.  Blood splays out in sheets, coating Daran and the tree in great gouts of blood and ichor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing reaches behind his back and grabs Daran.  Squeezing him, he throws him bodily across the field  The half-elf hits the base of a tree and crumples.  The giant roars with approval.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman elf screams and attacks the giant.  The leader is still having trouble getting up.  Suddenly, an old woman appears before him and gives him a vial of something to drink.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman's bow breaks with a <i>sproing</i>.  She throws it across the forest floor, rushes to pick up Daran's bow, and then rushes to the half-elf.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Startled at seeing his companion and guide flung so callously to the thicket, a surge of magic courses through Maouelue's fingertips.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ping. Ping. Ping. The purple bolts of light speed toward their mark, burying themselves in thick hide.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>And yet the balls continue to get frostier.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Enough!," Cries the blood witch, ready to bring this fracas to an end.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'><i>?"</i></span></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A dark voice rings in Bellatrix's mind.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Her confidence wavering at the arousal of <i>this voice</i> in <i>this place</i> Bella's breath shudders. She tries to regain calm and finish the job at hand with the last remnants of her constitution.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She withers....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Its as if the very fabric of this plane rejects the presence of the Blood Witch's uncouth magics here. Unseen hands slap at her every move as she struggles to conjure anything else to end this dread encounter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She tries a final blast, with the last of her energies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>From somewhere <i>deep</i> within, a cherished yet incredibly private memory, a source of power, rushes to her defense in this critical state. Life and Death seem to swing wildly out of balance as the magic flies!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As she begins to faint from the exhaustion of her soul power, she performs the faintest trace of her dance, falling to the ground as she implores the idiotic giant one last time to run its head into the nearest hardest object.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She falls to the ground, and as she does so, a darkness covers her.  It has never been seen in this land, and might never be seen again.  It covers her, clings to her <i>swallows</i> her, until she is cradled in a black pillow of negative energy in the middle of this beatific forest.  A growl emerges from the depths, the eladrin cover their ears.  The old woman leaning down to administer aid to the eladrin leader smiles widely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blackness contorts and morphs, bubbling up into a massive undead dragon.  It towers over the dazed giant.  It opens it's mouth and lets out a scream that shakes the foundation of the Feywild.  In one fell move, it dives upon the giant, eating it whole, and it continues to drive into the soil, the peaceful ground.  The darkness piles deeper, deeper, deeper into the ground, screaming the whole time.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, the tail of the monster flows into the forest floor, then...  silence.  And nothing mars the leaf-strewn ground.  Bellatrix lay at the center of the trauma, sleeping peacefully.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Slowly, the normal sounds of the forest return.  The bright colors blossom into clearer view again.  The forest seems to <i>breathe</i> again.  The female eladrin is hovering over a semi-conscious Daran.  The old woman is bandaging the elven leader.  The giants start to collect small insects.  Unlike the material world, though, these go about their business with a precision and grace.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a matter of minutes, the great giants are bones left to bleach in the mottled sun that streams through the trees.  Again, an almost sun-set.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All are staring at Bellatrix, each other, the area around them in strange amalgam of horror and relief.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue rises to his feet and solemnly walks over to the witch. He looks deep into her eyes as he kneels and offers his hand in assistance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That was quite a show of force my lady.” he whispers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She rises, shyly.  Gingerly.  "Thank you, kind wizard."  (Perception or insight check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage can't tell specifically, but something seems off about Bellatrix.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles demurely and then hastens to her sister, administering to the elven group leader.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>His eyes follow her retreat and linger a moment, nonplussed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns back to the spot where the dread dragon had plummeted into the earth. He rests his palms on the ground, eyes closed, feeling...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks the area but it is crystal clear of arcana.  Which is strange, because what you just saw was full of magic.  Or something of the like.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Perplexed but saying nothing, Maouelue moves back to join with the eladrin and the others. He walks up to them, deferentially.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf is still kneeling, looking abashed at Maouelue as he approaches.  "My sincerest apologies.  To you and your...  fellows,"  they breath heavily.  "I must say, your team fought extremely well against foes that have been known to ravage even the best of our fighters.  Even the half-elf fought valiantly."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Even?</i>,” Maouelue raises an eyebrow?</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed, all fought well and were it not for all of you here, I’m sure my days would be passed. I am indebted to you all.”</p><p></p><p>As he says this, his eyes linger on Bellatrix’s.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix blushes and looks away. (Smiling?)  The old woman nods and stands up, admiring her work.   Then whips the net around her shoulders.  She does not go invisible.  </p><p></p><p>Daran is led over, helped by the woman eladrin, who is also nursing a broken right arm.  Bellatrix rushes to her, as does the old woman, and they both start healing the two warriors.  </p><p></p><p>The leader says, "My name is Erifias.  This is Otirnis.  We are Winter Eladrin, not born in  this section of the Glimmerwood, but stationed to protect it.  Our lands...  Well, as you can see, our lands are in constant peril.  Our people die daily from raids of the shadar-kai and other fell monstrosities that are crossing at will into Faerie.  It is everything we can do just to stem the tide.  Lately, though...  Something is different.  The veil.  It is thinning.  Not only here, but to your world as well."  They take a very deep breath and wince.  They're covered in bruises that are turning a beautiful dusky purple.  They would be beautiful, at least, if there wasn't so many of them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I...  am sorry for our treatment of you.  All of you."  They raise their eyes slightly towards Daran, who nods respectfully.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And, although I hate to even ask as I know you have a mission of your own,  I would be delinquent in my duties if I didn't ask for your aid.  If you were to help us, I could take you directly to Titania, or any of the eladrin courts you would prefer to speak with.  You would have our loyalty.  As the worlds are today, that would be no small thing."  They smile at you all.  "As yours would be to us."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[4000 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods at you and gets up, weakly.  He starts heading over as Erifias says, "Thank you for your kind words, cousin elf.  It does lift our spirits an elf-kin has come to see Faerie in...  well, in most of her glory, anyway.  Let us treat wounds and heal, then I will take you to our court and tell you of the land and our troubles."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue returns the recognition with a nod, then moves over to check on Daran’s wounds first before looking in on Bellatrix’s condition.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran seems beat up, but generally fine.  Nothing a few healing potions won't cure.  And definitely nothing Maouelue hasn't experienced in the past.  Probably run-of-the-mill for the ranger.  As for Bellatrix, she's...  absolutely free and clear of any harm.  No bruises or cuts.  The only blood on her is smears of others' damages.  Which is...  strange.  Because Maouelue saw her get hit.  Several times.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage unstoppers one of the healing potions brewed by the Sister and offers it to Daran.</p><p></p><p>“You fought bravely Daran. I am in your debt yet again.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank you, Maouelue."  He takes the bottle and considers it before drinking half.  The mage watches as slices and punctures heal; Daran winces.  His posture straightens, then he gives the rest of the potion of healing to Otirnis, whose arm is in a makeshift cast.  A look passes between them, then Daran turns back to Maouelue.  "This was not what I expected.  Although, to be fair, I always expect a fight.  But this was nearly more than I was capable of.  Your company is much appreciated, in many ways."  The corner of his mouth twitches up.  And then Mao realizes, that is about as close to a smile that he's seen from the ranger.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods respectfully to Daran, giving him the grace of not prying any further.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He then turns to Bellatrix to examine her wounds, but upon looking, he is taken aback at the undamaged body before him. He marvels at the mysteries that seem to keep unfolding with this beguiling woman.</p><p></p><p>"My lady? You...that giant clubbed you beyond measure! How is it that you are unharmed?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, again demurely, to all in attendance.  Then she grabs Maouelue's arm and pulls him aside, a distance from the group.  Her fingers dig into his arm, painfully, yet her face is placid calmness.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Once a good 40 feet away, underneath the bough of a gorgeous willow tree, her countenance turns serious, worried.  Maouelue's elven attentions can see that she is nervous, her eyes occasionally dart around as if looking for something.  Or someone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm sorry for all of the cloak-and-dagger, but...  I might be in very big trouble.  That...  what happened...  at the end of the fight, with the dragon?  That..." she looks around, furtively.  "Mao, that wasn't me.  I didn't conjure that abomination."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue makes to shield their conversation from the main group by moving in front of Bellatrix with his back turned toward the rest.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't.....it wasn't you? What did you feel? What did it do to you? Your healing? Did it come from the drake?..."</p><p></p><p>He catches himself in his rush of questions, then pauses, and morphs his tone.</p><p></p><p>"You were unbelievable... I knew there was more to you than meets the eye, but....there was something else today. Something that I had not yet seen revealed. Breathtaking...."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She blushes, but still looks perturbed.  "You're pretty amazing yourself."  She moves a lock of jet black hair behind her ear.  "And yes, the healing, everything at the end...  It was like I was... inhabited."  She looks up at Maouelue, scared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We must find some time to delve further into this mystery, yet I fear if we conspire here much longer, our hosts' newfound acceptance may once again turn to suspicion. Let us make our way with the group and find rest ere long. There is much I would discuss with you <i>in confidence</i>."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He fixes her with a soft yet penetrating gaze, then starts to offer his hands, but thinks twice and abashedly puts them away, turning back to the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The witch follows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Pardon our withdrawal good fellows. There was something of a, err, private matter we needed to discuss. Pray, let us get back to the matters at hand. Is everyone quite well enough to carry on, or are any more in need of healing ministrations?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis answers, looking at Erifias, "As long as we move slowly, I am ready to leave this place.  Allow me to lead us, liege?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group at large takes time to regenerate and renew their energies.  Amazingly, the ealdrin, Maouelue, and even Daran seem to completely heal.  Had it only been an hour?  Time does work strangely in the Feywild, and this sobers all to that realization.  Meanwhile, Bellatrix and her sister scour the wilderness for ingredients. Finally, when all were rested and repaired, Erifias says, "Well, now, I believe we are all in better health.  Let us make our way.   We can discuss things as we move.   Is that acceptable?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yes, I believe that is the best course of action. My ears are open fellows, let us listen deeply and understand much."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Very well." Everyone packs up and begins heading our, Otirnis leading the way silently.  Bellatrix and the old woman follow the female eladrin, while Maouelue and the eladrin leader speak behind them.  Taking up the rear is Daran, ever watchful.  As all eyes scan the forest for signs of movement, life, or danger.  (Imagine the story telling as a beautiful ballad, not the quick-and-dirty I'm going to drop here!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't know how much you know about the Feywild, so I'll start there.  It is our understanding that we are a part of your material plane, and yet not.  We are the closest cross-over, however we are also afloat in the astral sea.  Some say we are a part of Arvandor, which is why Elves find themselves renewed here above all else.  Some say we're a plane of Olympus of Celestia, where the great dragon dwells.  In truth, we are simply...  the Feywild.  And we do what we can to preserve the balance of good and evil while benefitting from this land's beauty.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Otirnis and I are the protectors of seelie fey.  Our court is led by the High Queen Titania, and her Lord Oberon.  They rule in the city in the clouds, Senaliesse.  All of the seelie archfey live there, which is nigh impenetrable from its place in the heavens.  For us and our part, we live in the city of Astrazalian, which is watched after by Queen Titania's sister, the good sister, Queen Tiandra.  The bad sister, The Queen of Air and Darkness," he shudders, "She lives in the Feydark and commands forces of those abominations you fought earlier. Fomorians, they're known as.  Diseased and deformed because of their love of deceit and trickery.  They would have us seelie fey grovel and serve them for eternity, which is why we fight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Queen of Air and Darkness has no love in her heart.  She was to be the one to look over Astrazalian, but a contingent of dwarves brought the woman a black crystal that turned her heart to stone and bent her will to evil.  She will stop at nothing to rid this great land of the seelie fey.  Her co-horts, they're considered the unseelie.  Problem is, you never can tell which you're speaking with until it's too late.  Part of our hesitation with you and your folk here, mage.  Again, I hope that you will forgive us our intensity.   But it is how we have to be with our borders under constant attack.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And lately, not just our borders.  Astrazalian has been attacked thrice in the last season.  Once in ten years is even more than normal, so this...  I can tell you, both Queens Titania and Tiandra are concerned what this means for the future of the feywild at large.  Goblins are joining with the fomorians.  They're recruiting the Moon Court, as well.  Which means lycanthropes may be at our gates at night, and giants and goblins attack during the day.  No one can fight a battle on three sides.  And there might be an archwizard at play here, too.  From your world.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Needless to say, aside from all of our martial ability and arcane skill, we're at a deficit.  We'd like to get more outliers to band together, but it is political and difficult.  Our foursome are a scouting party for both new members, and for the movement of the opposing forces.   There have been rumors, however, that Queen Titania would like a rogue group to go behind enemy lines and strike at the heart of the insurgence."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It was being surrounded by trouble on all sides that led us to tread these lands just ere. Some dark secret has begun to stir in our realm. Lofty lords who dug too deep in search of ancestral powers have drawn fel beings to our realm. Serpent walks as man through the streets, dark underground shrines and altars of sacrifice lie underneath our very feet. Yes, foul magic indeed and perhaps and Archmage you say? I do not envy the position of my confidant Dieter, who was taken into the clutches of this very mystery. It is mine and our party's mission to divine his location and rescue his person. It could be that the Queen and our consort could come to a collective conclusion that carries our copacetic causes."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They nod, considering.  "Yes, yes.  I believe there are copacetic causes here.  Snakes as men, you say.  Curious.  There have been sightings here of the same.  Snakes are not native to the Feywild.  Very curious."  Erifias scratches his hairless chin.  "I wonder...  this archmage in your realm, could you recognize them on sight?  And these serpents, could you identify them if you saw them again?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The serpents yes, the archmage? I couldn’t say...We were following the traces left my the Lord Muhlen and his progeny deep into the earth. We found a deep ravine that seemed to stretch down into the abyss just outside our township of Oakhurst. There seemed to be competing causes in the caves, either one always a step ahead of us.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Erifias ponders deeply, furrowed brows giving him a strange, elderly look.  They shake their head, "The Queens will need to hear what you know.  And, if they do ask you for help with the attack, you'll have our help behind you."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Erifias stops speaking, all of the elven ears hear a murmur in the distance.  A low buzzing sound that grows in intensity as the group pauses, listening.  Waiting.  The buzz turns into a horn sound, starting off very low in timbre and growing loud and rounded, sounding like horn mixed with the beat of a bass drum.  The welling surrounds the group, and, looking at the eladrin, Maouelue sees abject fear in their eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"RUN!" yells Erifias, and Otirnis grabs Bellatrix and the old woman and they vanish, disappearing out of sight.  "Do either of you have any transport spells?  I am unable to use mine at the moment."  Fear creases their face, their head is on a swivel trying to look at the entire forest while sprinting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Running away from the sound, the now trio fund themselves running straight at a patch of blackness on the ground.  It clashes right away with the surrounding woods.  Suddenly, Erifias stops cold in his tracks, grabs the backs of the garments of Maouelue and Daran as they just go past them.  Erifias looks to the left and the right.  The pair follow the eye movements and spy two moss-ridden obelisks jutting from the ground.  It looks as if the ground past the pillars starts to become sodden, muddy, bog-like.  After 50ft or so, the ground becomes like pitch or tar, bubbling in places.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>"No, no, no...  Not here.  Not now,"</span> the eladrin whispers.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm afraid my studies have not yet revealed to me the magics of portals. Though I must say, I greatly desire to delve into the art. Daran, you brought us here, have you anything else up your sleeve to get us out of this dread approach?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets a shiver up his spine.  He scans the bog, seeing the beautiful trees arch away from this place.  The ones that can't move themselves farther away turn diseased.  Their bark peels, the wood desiccated and rotten as it seeps into the mire.  Then Maouelue looks closer.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bubbles...  some of them are popping but...  some of them...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One blinks at Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What is this new devilry?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Erifias starts trying to pull the two of you back.  "This is not supposed to be!  This place is protected from this kind of... of...  We are truly losing our world if the Boucbin is here."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eyes continue to blink.  The group continues to back away.  The beating of your hearts fades, but is replaced by the horn and bass drum from seconds earlier.  Panic starts to set in.  Erifias bolts to the right, yelling, "Follow me!  There has to be a way around!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Running rough-shod through the forest, Daran misses his footing and flails for only a second.  He rights himself, but is now at the back of the pack, a few feet behind Erifias and Maouelue.  The horn blares, the drums beat louder...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(DC 12 - Group check 14+...  1 pass, 1 fail.)  The group dip, dive, and dodge through.  The black sludge eyes follow their movement.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group sees the black sludge RISE UP out of the muck, into a humanoid-ish shape of eyes and goo.  It tries to smash down on the group...  but just misses!  The horn blares suddenly, off to the right of the group.  It pulls Erifias' head around just enough for them to lose balance.  Daran rescues him just as they're about to fall, and now both Daran and the eladrin are 15 feet behind Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The edge of the bog appears ahead of the trio.  Just a few more feet and they'll be beyond the black sludge and be able to continue...   That's when the horn blares triumphant and the drums beat viciously.  Emerging from the forest, knocking trees over in the process, is a horde of goblins.  Some are atop wargs, some even ride an ogre or two.  But the main group ride a contraption that, in one, looks to be a wagon turned into a siege machine.  It towers over 20ft tall, and, strangely, doesn't seem to be pulled by anything.   Thick gouts of black smoke erupt from behind it as it's propelled forward...  right at the group!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue from his slightly more advanced position, turns around and begins to speak. His feeling of kinship with the people and the lands here ever growing, he breathes deep and channels the newfound energies from his recent reverie.</p><p></p><p>Metal clad arms perform spirals in the surrounding air. Blue-white begins to emanate from his Platinum Shield of Disruption and Sword of the Mists. Lights begin to glow from the Triple-Triumvirate he carries, each of the nine platinum orbs now shining with a crystalline azure, a faint twinkle of starlight permeating each from within. They begin to orbit Maouelue in atomic arcs around his torso, centered on the innermost light of his spirit, the protagonistic protons of his person. Faint trails of icy blue dust are left behind by each of Maouelue's Mettalicomets as they bend and dive around him. </p><p></p><p>Eyes glowing deep within the Frostbitten Helm, he sends forth three of the orbs, their light tails elongated and bending with the fae light surrounding them as the streak into their targets, the lead warg and ogre-riding goblins, and straight into the center of the onrushing chariot.</p><p></p><p>"Star of Bahaumut guide my Light into the heart of the darkness corrupting these lands!"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Continuing his spinning atomic motions, the air around Maouelue begins to coalesce in icy snowflakes that begin forming into a spiral of snowballs interlocked with the metallicomets. They all shoot forth together, pelting their targets one after the other!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin has sat down on the ground, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An aura of blue surrounds him.  Maouelue and Daran have just noticed him.  Daran looks at Maouelue.  "We can't leave him, can we?"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The malleated  Metal Mage, much maligned, manages to massacre many mobs, morosely melting into the moist moss a mess.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, completely out of character for him, hugs Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank you, friend.  I thought I was dead and gone, there."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I thought the same of myself! You've saved me YET AGAIN!," He fairly weeps in relief at his new friend."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran realizes they're on the edge of a devil bog, and he pulls Maouelue away a bit further.  After they move a safe distance away, he says, "What do you think happened to our eladrin friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[3500 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm not sure...I heard him fleeing as I fell back there. Could be anywhere, though perhaps he will have taken vantage of our situation. Could have used a few spare arrows for that one though..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue unstoppers a large red potion that the Sister had prepared for just such an occasion. "Drink up Daran. We'll need our strength about us. I've just reset, but am near depleted after that last fracas. We may do well to find somewhere to recover yet again, but first let us investigate."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He feels a sanguine relief flow through him, this time only spilling a few drops from his parched lips onto his plate mail, the cool blue metal seeming to drink in the red as it fades in to the iridescent sheen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He heads over to the wreckage of the goblin cart to glean what he can about this horde, picking through the bodies and exploring the mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Casually he quaffs another cuppa.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaaaaah, that does it," he remarks as the second large bottle of red disappears down the hatch.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hands the vial back.  "I've got magics still to help with that, thank ye though."  He inspects the wagon with you, carefully.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two watch as the crazy wagon weapon sinks into the mire.  It's about half in now, but Maouelue sees a couple packs on the back of the machine.  The smoke has stopped now, and a couple good dex or acrobatic checks could get you there and back with the packs.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is a bit too heavy.  When he tries to jump, he lands a few feet from it, square in the black sludge.  (Con save and then dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gets a rope out of his pack and quickly tosses it to the mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue grabs the rope and is whisked back to safety.  The wagon drops a few more feet.  Luckily, there were not ill effects from the sludge...  for the moment.  Daran holds up a finger, then gets ready to jump.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger hops deftly over the bog in one go, grabs the two satchels.  But just as he's jumping back over, the goblin weapon lurches and throws of Daran's balance by just enough.  He lands just a couple feet shy of the edge of the bog.  Quickly, he standing-jumps out, but falls to his knees, clasping his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shakes his head, stands, and hands the bags to Maouelue.  "If there's anything edible in there, I'd appreciate a bite and a rest."  He smiles at Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Eh, let’s see what kind of piss these goblins feats upon them...”</p><p></p><p>Maouelue inspects the packs carefully before opening, lest the goblins had something nasty in store...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first bag is muddy and ill-kept.  It has pouches on the sides, but they are empty on inspection.  A thin flap of material covers the opening of the bag.  As Maouelue opens it, he finds some bits of hard tack and jerky.  Both smell a little stale, but edible.  At the bottom of the bag are a very nice set of bone dice.  Lastly, a platinum amulet with a strange symbol weighs the satchel down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Amulet Charm</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue tosses the rations over to Daran, stows the bone dice, then inspects the amulet further.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other satchel has a pair of boots.  They do not look goblin made.  There's blood on the cuff of one of them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After much contemplation on the necklace, Maouelue can't seem to place the symbol.  Daran is <i>very</i> thankful for the food.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ground starts to rumble, out of nowhere.  Daran gives Maouelue a <i>not again</i> look, and takes up his bow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think I might be too old for this..." says Daran as another moss-and-mud-streaked obelisk emerges from the forest floor 20ft from their location.  Immediately behind the two heroes, the black ooze starts moving their direction while the trees between them and the sludge start deteriorating fast.</p><p>"I fucking hate this place."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Elven reflexes honed from battle, the two sprint from standing and leap the last bit, just before the ooze reaches them.  </p><p></p><p>As they lie sprawled on the forest floor, panting, a tendril of goo reaches up, is met by more, and they combine to make a humanoid monstrosity covered in blinking eyes and popping sludge bubbles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The <i>thing</i>  wobbles, quakes... then speaks.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a voice that can only be described as gelatinous material being pushed through a sieve, the words roil out, attacking the heroes' senses.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You are quick.  We were hoping for a snack.  The goblins and their mounts will have to do.  When you see Titania, give her a message from us.  We are here.  And we are coming.  First her lands. Then her people.  Then," it makes a disgusting <i>slurrrping</i> sound.  "Then we come for her."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stares in horror at the bog beast, shocked into stillness for a moment, then righting himself and calling back, "We'll see about that you disgusting slime. A new light shines on these lands that you cannot hope to drench in your foul darkness. Go back to the brimstone quagmire whence you came!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Big words for one so young.  And small.  Deliver my message or no.  It matters not.  All come to me in the end."  And it melts back into the bog.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds later, a flash of blue light appears a distance away, in the direction of the forever setting sun.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue lets out a deep breath with eyes closed as the fiend leaves, then looks up at the horizon, letting the light sear into his eyes and warm his plate. The flash pours in through his eyes to his soul, scouring the remnants of fear and disgust that sought to take root there from this latest encounter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us away, pray that the eladrin find us."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the duo shield their eyes to look into the sunset, they see forty or so winter eladrin running through the forest clearing towards them, Otirnis in the lead.  Bellatrix can also be seen, just behind the lady eladrin.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Noticing the ranks and...Bellatrix...rushing in, Maouleue dusts himself up and stands tall, propping Daran up into a casually relaxed posture as he does. </p><p></p><p><i>Yes, that will have the desired effect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The light beams and shatters prismatically across the cool blue-white plate, three frosted platinum spheres still tracing around the mage atomically.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Mao cuts an <i>impressive</i> visige, especially considering the gore of the battle around him.  The soldiers go from sprint to jog, then confusion as bodies lay all around them.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The army approaches you both <i>extremely</i> cautiously.  Even Bellatrix, noting the gruesome nature of the arrow-and-frost ridden goblins, worgs, and ogres, gives the both of you a wider berth.  "Ahoy, there," an eladrin yells.  "Are you Maouelue the Mage and Daran the ranger, come from the material plane?  Answer true, or there will be violence in the name of Queen Titania!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue let’s his orbs come to a rest, arranging them as verticies in an equilateral triangle surrounding his feet. As he does this, the other six coalesce into a surrounding hexagon, giving the effect of a metallic mandala with the Dragon Mage at its center. ￼</p><p></p><p>“I am one and the same. My companion and I have needed life-saving measures, both from each other and in service of your kin, having done the same for them amidst similar suspicion. It would seem your lands are overrun with darkness from beneath. It is that which both pushes and draws my company higher. Pray, I seek now violence with the Queen nor any of her <i>servants</i>. Mine and our aim together would be to shine mine and thine divine light on the roots of this evil. Would you not agree?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look at each other, searchingly.  Otirnis strides forward and, placatingly, tries to ease this strange tension.  "It is well that we found you here.  After the report from Erifias, we though you would be perished.  They send their apologies for the abrupt exit.  We are only able to use our fey transportation once in a full-day's time.  Since they used it to bring our original foursome scouting party to this woods, Erifias was unable to use it again so quickly.  Only after an intense meditation were they able to use it.  They are aware you saved their life.  Erifias was heart-broken that their plan did not work."  She crosses her left hand over her right shoulder and bows deeply to the duo.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran goes up to her and lifts her shoulders so that they are face to face.  Her breath catches as they look at each other.  With weariness exuding from him, he returns the salute.  The rest of the soldiers do the same.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix scans over the scene, and catches Maouelue's eye.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He catches her eyes and holding them in his gaze, he salutes her in the same fashion, but slowly, intentionally.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She goes to Maouelue, raises him up, and embraces him.  "I thought I lost you."  The wizard hears soft sobbing in his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Stunned, not least by her her show of strength to lift him fully clad, Maouelue lets out a great gasp that turns into a laugh before fading to him softly saying, “No, no, no...I’m still here. And I’m glad you’re here with me Bella.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, looks down at the ground sheepishly, and says, "I.. I raised a circle of hell when they teleported us and wouldn't bring me back right away."  She looks around, "Seems you did fine by yourselves, though, aye?"  A little brogue comes out, which hadn't been there before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Not completely certain she didn’t raise an <i>actual</i> circle of hell, he replies, “Your wonders never cease milady...” A pregnant pause and then he adds quietly, “I look forward to our private conversation.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As do I."  </p><p>Otirnis comes over with a medicine kit, checking over Daran and Mao.  Several others are scouring the forest for remnants and spoils of the battle.   Finally, when all is done, Otirinis says, "It is time to go.  Are you all ready?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue starts at the sound of Otirnis’ voice and moves back into a less familiar position with Bellatrix. “Yes, ah...indeed. Indeed we are Ortinis.” He flashes one more glance back at Bella, not quite able to comply contain his broadening smile.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue sets off with the others, not entirely sure if it’s his new boots or something else making him feel like he could jump three times his usual height. </p><p></p><p><i>I’ll have to test that out soon...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The soldiers and the material plane group stand in a circle, on Oritnis's orders.  Everyone touches the other's shoulder, and Otirnis says to Maouelue and Daran, "We'll be transporting to the edge of the city.  From there we'll take you to see Queen Titania.  There's been a ban on teleporting within the city.  Got to be that every a'one that could teleport did for the most mundane reasons.  Became a bit of a problem.  Stay close and hold on to your neighbor.  Here we go."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A blue light surrounds the soldier next to Otirnis.  The glow spreads out from person to person to person, until the little clearing was awash in blue flame.  The forest blurs, the light becomes unbearably bright.  Then, in a <i>pop</i>, the entire group flashes, and everyone disappears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Quicker than a blink of an eye, the group now stands next to a cobblestoned road that looks gilt in platinum.  It shines, but not harmfully so.  Hands leave shoulders, pats and back-slaps go around the group.   A few nod respectfully towards the two newcomers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue bends down on two knees in reverence, then takes his palms together, leaning forward onto the platinum stone road. Leaning forward, he touches his helmet to the surface and prays. “Lord of life I am humbled in your deliverance.  My light follows only thine own.”</p><p>He stays kneeling for three long breaths, three seconds, six seconds, nine seconds...Then raises himself back up to the group, collected in spirit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All start walking the platinum road, which actually seems to change colors as they walk.  A rainbow patina effect greets Maouelue and Daran as they travel.  Daran smiles, in spite of himself.  After a half mile,  the trees on either side of the road come to an end and the view of the City of Starlight, Astrazalian, emerges.  The tall wall sparkles as a sky at night.  Beyond the gates, the Starlight Castle careens toward the sky.  Spires and turrets abound.  Color and majesty astound the new arrivals.  Some of the soldiers laugh at the mouths agape.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Astrazalian, The City of Starlight</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue feels the celestial beauty of the city like a blast in the chest, riveting and warm, like home...something he had not felt since back in the tower with Shi’Vandos. Something in the sky</p><p>catches his eye....is it a cloud? Was he seeing things or was his lord presenting himself in the silvery mists above the Starlight Castle? He shakes himself out of it, keen on staying aware of the cohort in which his companions now find themselves. It <i>feels</i> like home, but he knows it’s not. Not <i>yet</i> anyway...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis comes up beside Maouelue's group.  "We'll be heading straight for the keep.  Queen Titania and King Oberon are waiting there with The Seneschal, Queen Tiandra.  There, we will debrief them on all that has happened.  You can bring them up to speed on what we missed and your business in the Feywild.  Then, we can show you to accommodations.  We'll also be available if you need anything, or need to know where to find something in the city.  Follow me.  Oh, and welcome to Astrazalian!"  She smiles and nods.  Then jogs up a few paces to join in with two other winter eladrin.  Together, they lead you down the road to the crystalline city gates.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wonders about as the group enters the city and make their way to the castle.  Every color of Elf stand in the street to see the procession pass.  There are cheers and applause.  Children run into the street to touch the soldiers armor.  Some come up to Maouelue , Daran, and Bellatrix.  Reverence beams on their faces and in their eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The city center is awash with Elves awaiting the processional, too.  When they arrive, it's akin to the biggest celebration day any of the material planes people have ever seen.  Hands are wrung, backs are thumped.  Smiles are shared all around.  Finally, the last climb to the castle is begun, and the shouts of the crowds die away.  The doors of the keep are opened, the group pours in.  Once in, the soldiers split into their different avenues, Otirnis and her group motion the others to follow her.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Up the crystal staircase, through the beatific front halls, the trio is led into a massive throne room.  Atop the central dais, an inescapably beautiful summer elf, golden skin and hair wafting in unseen wind, sits upon the main throne.  Her king to her right, also golden from head to toe, sits smiling.  Lastly, a woman on the Queen's left and closer to the front of the dais seems to be made completely of silver.  All three sit up in interest at the soldiers and outsiders stride to them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Queen Titania and King Oberon, I present Maouelue the Mage, Daran the Ranger, and Bellatrix the Wizardess, three being from the material plane, come to honor your highnesses."  She bows as before in the forest.  Daran and Bellatrix follow suit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue joins in the protocol gratefully, but skips a beat as he realizes for the first time that he doesn’t see the Sister. <i>Where has she gone?</i> He wonders. His attentions returning, he follows Otirnis’ lead.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen atop the dais nods to King Oberon, and he starts in giving a grand welcome.  In Maouelue's mind, however, he hears a light, flowery female voice.  "Do not be afraid, dear cousin.  Bella's sister is safe and well in her rooms here in Castle Starlight."  A smiling Queen Titania looks at Maouelue from her throne.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out with his feelings, trying to test the limits of this connection, maintaining eye contact with Titania throughout. </p><p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>”Thank you for the hospitality and for assuaging my fears. I have read tome after long tome about the majesties of the star children. To be here in this moment is my greatest honor. May I be worthy of these hallowed halls in the end.”</span></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods, smiling.  King Oberon continues, and ends with a flourish.  There is polite clapping, he sits down, pride exuding from him.  The Queen gives him a wry smile.  She stands to address the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue casts a sideways glance at Bellatrix to see, among other things, whether she had a similar experience.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You all are most welcome here in the shining halls of our Castle Starlight.  We greatly appreciate your aid to our lands, and we sincerely hope there is more aid to offer, from both sides.  I look forward to hearing more of who our heroes are and what we can do to aid you in your fight.  Let us remove to our planning room.  I would hear more from each of you, if you please."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She was walking down the dais, and, in making the last statement, hits the main floor.  She waves the group over to a side room, and leads them to a beautifully decorated, catered room.  Food lines the wall and are piled on the table.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gives Bella a look, she looks back questioningly at him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Seeing her lack of understanding at his look, he quickly pivots to gesture to the grandeur of the Castle in all its glory, and that food...it is now that Maouelue realized he hasn’t <i>properly</i> eaten in weeks, if he could trust time anymore...the delicate spread takes over his conscience as they are led to the  reception.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The full opaque crystal doors are drawn wide, showing an expansive room.  Not quite as large as the throne room, it's centerpiece is a massive transparent table, ovoid with many embellished chairs in the elven design.  On the table are varied stands of dried and fresh fruits, nuts, and light breads.  Large platinum ewers decorate the table with what looks to be wine.  Tables are set up along the sides of the main meeting space.  These are piles high with dishes both exotic and breathtaking.  Platinum bowls and serving plates hold tremendous amounts of delicacies.  There is a roasted bird about the size of two turkeys at the center, flanked by pink fish with a fiery sauce, greens and exotic-colored vegetables, stuffed pastries, and odd round objects covered in white shavings.  Flowers abound, mixing with the spicy and sweet aromas of the food.  The Queen says, "Eat, drink, be merry.  We will talk while we enjoy our heroes feast!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Servants stand at attention for anyone who needs assistance.  Several cellerars are standing in wait with drinks, if the table wine is not wanted.  The Queens and King stride through, picking at the table foods and finding their seats at the table's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Moments later, the old woman is brought down and she and Bellatrix have a happy reunion.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue assembles a plate with perhaps a bit less decorum than he might have wished, were he not <i>quite</i> so hungry. He is still agog with the wonder of this realm, regardless of the troubles it had already caused his party. He sits down on the left side of the King and Queen, offering Bellatrix a seat next to him at the table and calling for wine.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wine is poured by a lithe and sensual female summer eladrin that gives Maouelue a secret wink.  The smells of the food almost overwhelm him.  The wine is ruby hued, with flecks of gold fluttering within.  The food not only lifts the mages spirit, it gives him an undeniable feeling of hope and resurgence.  Akin to the feeling he had when first he came to the Feywild.  Daran and the others are similarly taken with the meal and the ambience.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a few moments of pure revelry in the tastes and smells, Queen Titania breaks the silence by saying, "I apologize for mixing business and pleasure.  I encourage you all to help yourselves to anything here, our table is yours.  However, we must speak on the events of the past day and look to the future.  Erifias and Otrinis have filled me in on the general events, to the best of their abilities.  Erifias is sleeping well, now.  Our best clerics administered them a great amount of healing.  They were nearly inconsolable, they thought their plan had doomed the two of you.  When Erifias awakes, it would do them well for you to be there, if you wish.  That being said, we must speak on our individual needs.  If it please you, I shall go first and let you continue to enjoy your repast?"  She blinks her large lavender eyes in Maouelue's direction, waiting for his permission.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks up with a leg of foul in his mouth, trying to nonchalantly out it back down on his plate and swallow quickly before he answers, “Of course, your Majesty.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The King chuckles and pops a quith-pa (the orb-like food) into his mouth.  The Queen smiles and continues, "We have been at war with the unseelie for quite some time.  My sister, who now calls herself the Queen of Air and Darkness, has been corrupted by a dark crystal.  In truth, if we could destroy the crystal, that would right everything, but I fear that is too lofty a goal for now.  She has raised an army, which has been attacking and killing our peoples all around the lands of the Feywild.  With her dire generals, she has made several strongholds, however most of them are in the Feydark.  I would not ask you to go into that abyss, for that would be requesting much more than any of us has to give.  However, there is one thing I believe you might be well suited for.  You have all proven yourselves tremendous fighters.  I believe if we were to eliminate a top ranking official of her command, we could stem the tide of the war, or shift it to our side.  I've been in talks with other realms regarding the creation of a force that might quell this uprising long-term.  Now, however, we need to strike deeply into her structure and make her realize we are not easy prey.  For this, along with our undying friendship, we offer you a boon.  Either of your request or of our choosing."  Her lavender eyes and golden skin ripple from the crystal reflection off of the table and plate-ware.  Her hair still wafts in the unseen breeze.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue, now recovering his somber and moderately zealous vigor, takes in the state of affairs and the interesting proposition before him and his followers. He looks around to Daran, Bella and her sister. He thinks of Vam and Heston, the wreckage of Oakhurst. He remembers poor Douglas, fallen to the vile Muhlen brood, and Culver whatever became of him. Most of all, he thinks of Dieter... Where in the depths of that foul Citadel could he be? What would he do in this situation? Surely the resourceful Druid was putting his cunning to great use, but how much time did he really have?</p><p></p><p>"My Queen, if I may call you thus, I feel a deep kinship to you and your people, <i>our people</i> and I would see this land restored to peace and glory. I will aid in its deliverance will all that I have to spare. My companions here, I leave to make their own choices, for they have risked much on my behalf already.</p><p></p><p>As are undoubtedly aware, we also face a grave uprising in our realm of Faerun. Dread Neogi walk in the daylight in forms both human and serpentine. Power mongers and arcane excavators have delved too deep into the secrets of our own underworld. As my companion Dieter the Deleter and I followed these dark trails, we followed a series of ancient tombs, each decorated with disturbing imagery of these serpents in their rituals of sacrifice and uprising.</p><p></p><p>It is true that I understand but little of the scope of this war, if that should be how we name it. I fear it is a war that has raged longer than even your sister's corruption. Yes, I will aid you in this cause, for it is far from impossible that these dark threads are bound in some way together, yet, my companion Dieter and I are also honorbound to each other and I will not leave him to fate at the hands of those who would seek to befoul our lands.</p><p></p><p>You speak of a boon and I would receive it gratefully, though I would also seek council and aid in our own fight. As I say, they may indeed be one and the same after all is laid bare."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees the Queen cock her head to the side, thinking, reflecting on the possibility the core of the problem is somehow linked between planes.  "You speak well, mage.  And you reason even better.  My sight does not cross to the material plane as well as it does others, but you have touched on a subject - reached it's core in truth -  that many of our archfey and protectors of other planes have worried over for some time.  There is a darkness that stirs.  It is gathering momentum, gathering strength in the form of powerful beings with long reaches.  I am afraid my sister is one.  You world may have one or many, as well.  This is truly a sobering thought."  She takes a deep breath.  "However, we cannot sit idly by and watch as our worlds are thrown into chaos.  It pleases the court that you would agree to this course of action.  Are you all in agreement, then?  Or do you wish for privacy, or more time to deliberate?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I consent on my own behalf. I invite the others to make their own assertions. I understand the need for haste, but I would ask of your hospitality a moment of repose for my party to tend our injuries and to convene amongst ourselves. I fear we are all still in a state of shock whose depths may yet be untapped. Would you grant us a reprieve of four hours to collect ourselves? After that, I would desire to meet in your war council chambers, if such a think ere had need of existence in these halls, and plan our strategies accordingly."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group looks appreciatively at Maouelue.  The Queen says, "We shall meet in our battle council chambers, but you may take as much time as you need.  Please venture anywhere in our castle or city.  If there is anything you need, we will send you with a attendant."  She looks to her head servant.  There is a short whispered conversation, and she returns to Maouelue to say, "Everything is arranged.  When you are ready to discuss the details, please let your valet know and we will meet here again."  She stands, as do the others right after her.  "It pleases me greatly that you are here, Maouelue the Mage.  It is indeed serendipitous.  You are most welcome here.  Well met."  She bows to you, in their fashion, as do all eladrin in the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stands and bows in return, thanking the Lord and Lady profusely for their hospitality before turning to the valet and asking where they might find their chambers to let down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Court retires to a room beyond the feast hall, the valet ushers you all into separate rooms not far from the throne room, all on the main level.  The rooms are spacious, airy, and decorated simply but elegantly.  A warm breeze plays at the curtains, where beyond is a balcony overlooking the city center.  A soldier comes in, introduces himself, and resumes a station outside your door.  There is  full washroom, a sitting room, and a sleeping chamber.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Maouelue walks into the room he cannot help but think to himself, “<i>I could get used to this...I musn’t...but I could.</i>” He begins to doff his armor, rubbing his shoulders as he does. There are some aches that even the elven food won’t cure, and it certainly does not quell the smell of his under armor sweat. He strips down bare leaving the armor and garments in a corner of the room before moving into the washroom and drawing a hot bath for a long-overdue soak. </p><p></p><p>Though he is by rights a frost mage, Maouleue does not shy away from bringing the water to a heat just shy of scalding. A pure heat from within, as Shi’Vandos used to say, stays an frozen heart when the ice starts to flow. </p><p></p><p>As he sets himself in and lets the hot water scour his skin and spirit, the rare combination of warmth, silence, and safety cast him into a misty reverie.</p><p></p><p>The rising steam in his eyes turns to swirling clouds, spinning upwards to a vision of the tower where his master...his father...<i>it still hadn’t quite set in after all this time...</i> had led him to the discovery of his secret heritage. The memories, always a distorted mixture of emotions in his mind, seem to resolve more clearly in this palace of starlight....</p><p></p><p><i>“My son....”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"... Shi'veilan is his name.  He is your younger brother.  I am... sorry it's taken this long to tell you of him."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Master...." </p><p></p><p>Maouelue, bewildered at the flood of destabilizing revelations, is not yet ready to call him <i>Father</i>...</p><p></p><p>"...Why?...Why have you kept this from me for so long? Why would you send me away at the moment of knowing? We could have....We could have...."</p><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shi'Vandos smiles kindly down at the boy, but the smile doesn't completely reach his eyes.  He looks sorrowful and frustrated.  "It is...  not a story I like to tell.  I would rather you remember me, know me for my triumphs.  Not my failures.  Mortals have the potential for great works and deeds.  Yet, when posed with the possibility of... gratification..."  He shrugs.   "We are mortal.  My choices have erred on the side of pleasure, as time is so short.  Even for us elves."  He calmly moves to sit at a nearby chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue does not speak fir fear of faltering. He listens patiently, trying in vain to still the icy tempest forming in his heart and soul.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elder elf sees the torment on his pupil's face, and the look of sorrow deepens.  Not only for what has been done, but what needs to be done as well. </p><p></p><p>"I shall try to explain.  Some time ago, I was fortunate enough to live in and study the magics of the Feywild, a section of Arborea or Celestia, another plane altogether.  It is where a selection of elves, some would say the <i>prime</i> selection of elves, segregated themselves.  It is a land rife with danger, beset on all sides by evil that would tear the elves asunder if they let their guards down for an instant.  Not exactly Arvandor, but, then again, what can be.  I was born there, grew there, learned the secrets of magic there...  and was exiled from that wondrous land because of my...  nature.  A woman was my downfall."  He hangs his head, but there is a smile on his face, in remembrance.  "Noble families can be particular about who they allow into their... erm...  bloodline.  My family... <i>our</i> family is not noble born.  We are not eladrin.  But we are still elf, and that should garner some respect, from all corners of Toril."  He shakes his head.  "Anyway, I was exiled and sent through a crossroad to the material plane.  Alone.  To make my way in the great world.  And I did so.  Sometimes alone.  Sometimes, no so much so.  There was a woman.  A druid.  In the wilds of the Neverwinter Wood.  I was near death.  She took me in.  I owe her my life."  He stares into the distance, lost to his thoughts for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"When she told me she was with child...  I don't know.  I wasn't ready for that.  I was not ready for a life like that.  Nor was I able to give her or the child what they needed, and I knew that.  Yet there was no convincing her of that fact."  Shi'Vandros's long, sorrowful face looks into Lemaoue's soft, tear-filled eyes.  "Your mother and I parted ways that day, not destined to see each other ever again."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He tears his eyes away from you, a tear streaking down his cheek.  "It was several years later that I had the opportunity to try again.  This time with a woman from a small coastal town on the Sword Coast.  A cleric of Lathander, she was, and we had to keep our love a secret.  It was a thrill for me, and when she became... in the family way, I strove to do better.  I told her we could have the child in secret, take a long trip and, when she returned, she could take up the vocation again without anyone being wiser.  So, that's what we did.  She had a friend in the town, we arranged it so that the child would grow up as hers, in her family.  And we would all be able to be happy, at least somewhat.  Both families were so wonderful with the child.  It soon became..."  His voice breaks, a sob pulled from him like a reverse bellows.  Like a dragon breathing fire, the pain of the past came belching from the elder's chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It became clear I was unneeded and unwanted.  I left on the morrow.  Again, never to look back.  Some years later, after I took a position as a teacher here, I looked in on you.  As I've said before, I always knew you had an aptitude for the arcane.  Know you know why I was so adamant."  He smiles at Lamaoue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A few years after your lessons began in earnest, I received this letter."  He reaches into a fold of his robes and hands a very crumpled piece of parchment over to the apprentice.  Shi'Vandos then bends at the waist and covers his face with his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao looks up now at Shi’vandos with red, running eyes and reaches out a shaking hand to take the letter, reading it over and over. </p><p></p><p>“...And so it comes to this...you would shed your kindred responsibility once more and leave the cleanup to those in your wake? You would have me go in your stead to find this....Shi’vailen, my....my <i>half-brother</i>....Do I indeed divine your intent...<i>father</i>...</p><p></p><p>He now holds the letter with two quaking hands, sadness mixed with rage and thoughts of betrayal, of love....of loss. </p><p></p><p>“Why...why father? I still...I still...” Lumao fully breaks down now, dropping the letter to the ground and sinking his head fully into his quivering palms.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shi'Vandos slowly unfurls himself and rises until he is looking his newly named son face-to-face.  He is no longer sad.  He is furious.  </p><p>"I would have you learn that which you seek, youngling.  I would have you take what is yours by birthright.  Not your upstart brother, who knows NOTHING of me.  Of my struggles.  Of his lineage.  He seeks the trials, but at the end, there will be nothing but tribulation on him.  He will continue to be shunned and will be exiled from the Feywild, as I was.  Because he is not eligible for the blessing.  You want to know of the 'circled key'?  You want to know of the deep ice in the mountain?  You want to master the element, master <i>youself</i>?  Then claim your birthright.  Not for me, not for <i>my</i> redemption.  That is impossible now."  His eyes burn a blue flame.  "If <i>you</i> request the trials and live to finish, when you are presented with the crest, <i>only you</i> will be able to take on the symbol.  Only you.  It is up to you.  Take what is yours.  Or carve your own path."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Had he been thinking clearly, Lumao might have expected something like this. It was not often that he let his tempers get the better of him, and now that his impertinence has drawn forth this furious retort, his shame and guilt grow red on his face. A new flood of tears begin to flow now, tears of embarrassment and remorse for his lack of faith in Shi'Vandos. Never before had his master...father...given him reason to provoke, to lash out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Father...I beg your forgiveness. I should not lose my temper nor doubt you. You have been ever attentive to me and I must admit, I've always felt your teachings and presence as fatherly, and now in the moment of truth that that is indeed the case...I have failed you at the first step. It is not my place to doubt you. It is not my wish to scorn. I must ask your forgiveness, for I should not presume to know your thoughts, I should not presume to lecture on that which I do not know. My penance now, must be to follow through on this revelation of knowledge. </p><p></p><p>You are dear to me above all and I am ashamed to have chided you. I will carry out this quest of heritage that you have entrusted to me. I will find answers...May I earn my absolution through this journey.</p><p></p><p>I will not fail you."</p><p></p><p>Lumao lowers himself in a submissive deference to the majestic and larger-than-life Shi'Vandos, his eyes remaining downcast as he waits for the response.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Raise your eyes, youngling," the elder elf says softly.  "There is no reason to beg forgiveness; no need for your penance or absolution.  Nor is there reason to mistrust your feelings on this matter.  I <i>am</i> to blame for all of this;  for you being put in this position, for Shi'veilan feeling as he does.  However, knowing what we know of the arcane, of the weave that blends and balances, the weft and warp correcting flaws and strengthening bonds...  We know all things have their place.  Even feelings.  Go forward with your passion.  Go forward with your fire.  You could never displease me...  son.  You are strong."  He stands in front of his student, hands inside the opposite sleeves, eyes wet with emotion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your wayward brother will be at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  He will be expecting me.  Give him this note.  Then, no doubt, you will begin the trials.  They are a series of tests, but not like what your brother is expecting, I imagine.  They are tests of character, not of skill or strength.  Not even of magic, although the result will get you that which you have been studying and searching for.  Take what you need for a long journey.  You can find a crossover to Faerie in several areas, but the strongest and possibly the most direct might be near Mount Hotenow, or one of it's cave systems.  I seem to remember one leading me right into the heart of the Neverwinter Wood."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks wistful, staring out one of the stain-glassed windows.  "Who knows," he says into the distance, "you might even find someone to share the road with you."  He blinks, seems to come back to himself, and smiles at Lumaoue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The apprentice, now collecting himself, lifts his head now and as he sees the smiling face of his father, he swells and straightens upright, now once again holding himself with the dignity that is his due. He hoped he would never forget this moment. Though his quest was daunting, finally, he would lay down the lore and become the stuff of stories. How he had always dreamed of Faerie and all its mysteries. Ancient starlight...</p><p></p><p>“I will leave at dawn.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shi'Vandros, eyes shining, closes them and bows in the ways of his forefathers to young Lumaoue.  He straightens and, with a smile, leaves his apprentice to get ready.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>The young elf hears the words fading “Goodbye Lumao”...”Goodby my Lumaoue good bye to you LuMaouelue Bye Lue Mao...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The scene becomes misty as he hears a sweet music drifting into his consciousness. A montage of  his fledgling journey begins to fly through his minds eye; the descent from the tower and through the main academy grounds, carrying only what he absolutely needed, a spartan beginning for an aspiring hero. Soon the carefully engineered wooden walkways of the campus grounds give way to the deeper, wilder woods beyond. As the trees approach they begin to domineer over him, and a cold wind blows through, it seems to root him, he tries to put a foot forward into the trees but his body won’t obey. Something has him rooted. As he struggles against the sensation, slowly fear and breathlessness overtake his view into darkness...</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mage comes up spluttering, coughing out spurts of the lush foamy water. His reverie had taken him deep, perhaps a bit too deep. Wiping the foam and water from his face he rises out of the tub, a sight to behold, wavering but collecting in the steamy washroom air. He dries himself and puts on a robe before sidling over to the day bed and beginning a prayer to his patron asking for guidance. In answer, he simply hears, “Stay Vigilant.” The Dragon Mage picks up his armaments and gets to his exercises, exorcising the foul blockages of his psyche with each thrust and shadow parry. Back to work.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's a knock on the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Enter.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran peeks his head in.  "Sorry, Maouelue.  I'm headed into town for some supplies.  Need me to get you anything?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let me accompany you to the market. I need to have a look around myself. What of the lady Bellatrix and her sister?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Haven't checked in yet."  They were shown to their room next to yours.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Good. We should head out the two of us at once. Let us not disturb the others.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, turns and makes a motion to the guard at the door.  The ranger has a guard in tow as well, so the four set off into the city proper.</p><p></p><p>The open market is the first thing the group comes to after exiting the palace.  Fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meats, spices all on display.  Various artisans pose their wares, a few of them creating new pieces on the spot.  Music fills the air from several minstrels both passing and stationed in their own artisanal areas.  Beyond are the shop fronts, advertising everything from weaponry and armor to magic elixirs and salves.  A few are fairly unique shops, specializing in curiosities.  The entire city is bathed in an autumnal light from the still setting sun.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Along the way, Maouleue doesn’t speak much. He seems business-like and intent on carrying out a few long overdue bits of trade and to seek out some of the new wares he might find in such a place. He stops first by the weapon and armory to peruse the wares and offer up for sale some of the goods overflowing from his Bag of Holding ™️.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, if there’s any of this you might find useful, it is yours, else I’ll transmute it, so to speak.”</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep any eye out for any enchanters as well, perhaps some work could be done on some of this too. If we ever do find Dieter, he should have something of Faerie make.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods again, then points to a large shop.  A picture of an anvil with a sword and a bow crossed behind it dominates the entryway.  Wares are put out for display, and it looks like this place is a one-stop-shop for armory and weapons.  A blacksmith's, fletcher's, and weaponsmith's shops are all all rolled into one, and there are several armor stands decked out in front of the place with impressive specimens of the workmanship.  On the decorated anvil sign, Maouelue can read <i>The Unbreakable Anvil</i>.  Loud clanging can be heard from within and near the rear, while a few customers mingle throughout.  There is an elf at the center of the store weaving a leather handle-grip  onto a short sword.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage after emptying his wares takes a moment to consider the old scrolls stowed in his pack. <i>I"ll have to inscribe these upon my return to my chambers</i>, he thinks to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Daran, would you mind keeping an ear out for interested buyers whilst I peruse the selections here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The shop-keep puts the leather-work aside and takes a look at everything.  After studying it (and the pair) a bit more, he says, "This all looks pretty good.  Might need to hone some things, but all in all, pretty good pieces.  Especially that plate mail.  I'll give you...  $1,971 gold for the lot."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm, make it a cold 2001 and we got a deal."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around.  "I don't quite have that much.  Tell you what, if you gents want to look around and grab something, we could make a deal?"</p><p></p><p>Daran looks to Maouelue.  "All I need from here would be arrows."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Maybe a hone for my blades, too, if'n ye do that here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf looks over.  "Absolutely we do!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around for a nice set of greaves to go with his nearly complete set, perhaps a plate or scale belt as well...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The greaves they have are pretty standard, and leather only.  There is a metal scabbard, but it is a back-oriented carrier, not a side holster.  The scabbard looks to be made for a greatsword.  The blacksmith sounds like they're in, though...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm, let us see what's happening over at the forge. Mind keep an eye on our gear here while we inspect."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue examines the kinds of metals being hammered with interest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, perusing the arrow stock.  The shop elf waves and goes back to his weaving.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In the back of the store, a semi-open-air forge is set up.  It's a beautiful design only the elves could come up with.  The smoke seems to be siphoned off by some trellis engineering in the domed ceiling of the forge.  The elf that works the anvil is large by elven standards, brawny, but not egregiously so.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks up when Maouelue comes in but doesn't say anything.  Just nods, and goes back to his hammering.  The hammer is a golden piece, beautifully wrought and etched with elven words and decoration throughout.  It rings with a pure, high note every time it hits the silvery sheen-ed metal being worked.  On  the anvil is an interesting attachment for, what Maouelue can surmise, is a halberd or spear of some kind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He approaches and admires the work. "Good morn good smithy. Tell me do you take commissions here for your work?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a heavy brogue-ish drawl you're not quite sure the origin of, he says, "Aye, I do.  Whatareye lookin' ta fashin?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll to be frank, I've been looking to cover up this spot tween my boots and plate. I have a particular proclivity for platinum, a penchant if you will. I am also keen to know whether you work with any enchanters in this city. I have heard of the wonders of Faerie and have some coin."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"OOh, aye.  We can do all o'that for ye, no worries friend.  Ye need some platinum greaves....  I'm almost done with this 'ere."   He starts rummaging around in his bins and crates of materials.  Finding three full platinum bars, he brings them over and says, "This whatcha lookin' for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well," he lowers his voice a bit, "Between you and me I need summat that will help me keep my head when my lust gets up in battle. I'm afraid this gap in my coverings begins to crave more than that of the wind....But I. Must. Remain. Vigilant. Yes, something to keep both my strength and my head in order." Maouelue looks around for a moment. "Might could you fashion a dragonscale pattern with this here platinum? Know you of any who might bestow them with this balance of power and intelligent restraint?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He scratches his bare chin and ponders.  Snaps and burbles come from the forge as smoke rises and plays at the ceiling tiling.  "Okay, here's wha ye do.  Yer gonna make yer way to the south part of the island, ya?  Once you get outta the city proper, you'll see Lanrion's Tower.  Somma th'shops here'll sell ya potions or whatnot.  Lanrion's the one to go to if'n ye wanna go big, aye?  Did ye want the armor 'fore ye go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes, perfect. Thank you for the guidance. What need you for the work? I’ve got a bit of coins and trade as you see.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, so ye 'ave!  Great to see!  These big boy's are 50 gold each, base price.  The work'll be another 100 gold.  I can get these done in two days for 250 gold.  If'n tha works for you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Fairest deal this side of the veil.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out his hand to shake on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They shake, the blacksmith says, "Name's Tovakis, by the way.  Lemme know if 'ere's anything else we can do for ye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Maouleue. Pleasure to meet you. Only other thing is to point me to the wizardry around here. I am curious about the local lores and magic of this place and would be keen to see any arcane tomes and scrolls that might be on offer.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Scrolls and tomes yer gonna want either the palace library or Mezomes Tomes, just a few doors down 'ere," and he points you down the street.  "Sfar as wizards are concerned, best places fer that'd be Spellbound, The Elder Marker, or The Lonely Elf.  All of them are in the East part of the city.  The first two are on the main road, the last is right near the city gates.  Can't miss 'em."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Many thanks friend. I’ll be back around in two days to take a look at things. Fare ye well.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue accepts the previous offer on his goods and then proceeds to Mezomes Tomes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran is sitting outside the tri-shop, looking over his new group of arrows.  He looks up, ready to get going.  Maouelue moves down the road to a smaller shop, tucked away in a cul-de-sac of walkways.  It is demure, simple, un-decorated.  Shelves of parchment and leather-bound books abound.  A booking elf with a pair of spectacles perched on the end of her long, slender nose looks up as the pair come in.  In a soft, feathery voice, she says, "Hello?!  How can I help you today?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh hello madam! I am a scholar of the arcane arts. I’m looking for a few spell scrolls to bolster my collection! And I wouldn’t say no to a tome of local lore!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks surprised, then it turns to elation as she scurried out from behind the back of her counter to meet with you.  You can see now that her hair, normally well kept for most eladrin, is a bit scraggly. The spectacles make her amber eyes look three times as big as they should.  She's wearing very plain clothing, but strangely has a traveler's leather vest with many pockets on the front.  She fairly skips over to the duo, making little squeaking noises.  The five cats in the shop look up in curiosity.   A black cat comes over and weaves through Maouelue's legs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The lore of the Fey lands?  Really?!  Oh, I'm so excited, that's what I am <i>most</i> passionate about here.  Is there an area of expertise you're focused on, or the city itself?"  She looks very expectantly at both men.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“As a matter of fact, I have a few interests. I would know more about the veil that connects the realms, how it weaves the planes together. I would learn of the Fortess of Frozen Tears, for I have heard a small bit that has peaked my interest. Last, I would learn of the trials and rights of lineage of the peoples here. I am a sort of anthropologist that comes from Faerun. I am curious to compare the Sylvan traditions with those of the Feywild...</p><p></p><p>...oh, and yes, whatever spell scrolls you might have about. I would peruse them if they be available.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh.. Oh, my, yes!"  Her hands patter while she looks around the shop.  She tries to steady herself and centers back on Maouelue.  "I can get you the appropriate texts you would need about the Fortress of Frozen tears and the Trials of the Eldar.  OH!  And I have <i>many</i> texts and scrolls on the planes and travel between them.  You come from Faerun, you say!  Oh my, that's <i>lovely</i>!  Tell you what, I'll get some items together, and you and your friend can peruse the spell scrolls at the rear of the store.  They're arranged alphabetically and by level.  I'll meet you back there soon?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Fantastic! The name’s Maouelue, though I used to go by Lumao. You may use either. What is your name mistress?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks shyly at the mage, curtsies, and says, "Nuala Beilyn, m'lord.  Please, take your time to look through my family's store.  I'll gather your texts!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaaah let's see, well for starters, I've always been keen on a certain little tidbit called <i>Ice Knife</i>. Do you have one of those around? I'll consider some others while you look."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"About what rates are these going for by the by? I've not had cause to shop in this city prior."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran helps Maouelue look.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Thinking back to his encounter with the giants and goblins in the forest, he adds, "What about Expeditious Retreat as well?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"...Cloud of Daggers?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm...What else...errr...Lightning Bolt?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok ok. and you know the last thing I'm looking for is...Frost Fingers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With Daran's help, the wizard is able to find Ice Knife, Expeditious Retreat, Lightning Bolt, and Frost Fingers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman comes back with a pile of books.  She places them down next to Maouelue and asks, "Did you find the scrolls you were looking for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“A far few indeed! And see what it is you’ve got there! Oh I do love a good lore dump.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Don't meant to be too brash, but what might we be looking at for this lot?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, my!  Let's take a look."  She peruses the lot.  "All of those, that will be 550 gold pieces.  You might not want all the ones I've found, but all together," Maouelue looks and there's seven books the woman found, "with the scrolls and the books, 800 gold pieces."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue holds out 800 of the gold coin from the armory and accepts the goods. “Thank you for ever so much. Your work will be put to very good ends. I’m sure I’ll be in again sometime. Adieu madam.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nuala takes the money, and says, "Thank you, m'lord.   Here is a satchel, for you to take everything!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Feywild</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The story sort of reads like a fairy tale (which makes complete sense!) about the son of Queen Titania.  He held court and was attended by three Daughters of Delight.  He was in love with one of them, Sharaea, in fact they were betrothed.  Something changed, however, and she absconded to the mortal plane where she fell in love with an adventurer and devoted her life to fighting evil.  The Sun Prince grew jealous and hunted the pair down relentlessly.  Eventually, he caught up to the two and imprisoned them both.  With her mortal love destined for death, Sharaea made a pact with the Raven Queen to save them both.  The archfey cast the two souls ahead in time, hoping to slake the temper of the Sun Prince.  This act, however, broke the Prince, and he left the city of Astrazalian, never to return.  He made his new home in the Vale of Long Night, and built a tower there, naming it the Fortress of Frozen Tears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A lot of legends swirl around the Pale Prince and his lands.  There is one that mentions his defeat bringing back summer to the Vale, however it incurs the wrath of Queen Titania, so the truth is murky.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are three smaller books that explain the Rites of Trial for commoners to become lords, lords to become nobles, and nobles to sit on the Court.  There are rituals and rites for having mortals (primarily elves, but the text is hazy) become permanent citizens of the Feywild.  In an obscure text, it tells of the Trials of the Eldar.  The Eldar were a group of the eldest nobles in five families.  Upon one occasion, it was necessary to choose an heir between several of a noble line.  The Five created the trials to help in this process, and it has been a hidden rite of passage for nobles wanting to contest their stations, or to claim a birthright.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The only thing about the actual trials themselves is that they are a secretive selection of scenarios that test a person beyond their imagining.  And that the end boon is typically one of the family's choosing, not necessarily a Feywild-specific or Court related prize.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lastly, there are three thick books on the subject of travel through the planes.  A particularly deep on is all about the creation of portals and crossovers.  Another is a philosophical discussion on the formation and design of the planes.  To better know the structure, it posits, one would better know the transportation options available.  Lastly, the third book is an old tome, cracked leather exposing fragile pages seemingly made of woven fibers.  The text in this is foreign to Maouelue and Daran, consisting of mainly pictures.  Notes in another strange language line the pages throughout, and even are interspersed within the pictures.  It is a cacophony of information, none of which makes much sense to the two adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us find carriage to the South. I would see of this Lanrion's Tower in order to best make our plans henceforth. I could use the time to review a few of these materials as we pass."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On of the guards pipes up and says, "We would be happy to procure that for you.  The Queen said if you require transport, we were to set it up under her personal envoy.  If you would excuse me, I will make preparations for a transport to pick you up here.  Unless you would like to meet them elsewhere?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a look around the streets, ah, we could perhaps do our waiting somewhere with a bit of vittles if that would suit. I'm quite keen to try the local fare. I've heard rumour of some new bread and cheese dish with tomatoes or something to that effect, I wonder if you could point us to your favorite haunts? Might there be anything like that around here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guard gives you a curious look.  "I am... unaware of any new dishes.  Of course, pardon my saying so, you are from the material plane."   He pauses to think.  "Just down the Sun Walk you'll find my favorite place for fare and drink.  The Queen's Smile is just north of here.  It's no tavern or inn, either, they just specialize in..  ah, vittles, I believe you mentioned?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ha! My mistake good elf! It would seem I am not <i>quite</i> adjusted to life on this side of the veil just yet! Yes yes, The Queen's Smile has the ring of goodness about it. What say you meet us there and we'll have your favorite ordered and ready for your return?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He jumps as if pinched, and says, with a widening smile, "For true?!  Well...  that would be wondrous indeed.  And I thank you, kind sirs," he stammers.  "I'll go now.  My favorite dish is the baked Chaos Sunfish.  Make sure you try the goldflower buns, too.  They're fantastic!"  With a big smile on his face, he makes his way back to the castle.  Daran chuckles as he goes.  "Think you made that one's month, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Heh, well we'll see how my wallet fares...I don't know what this might run me yet...But yes, he did seem quite keen."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We could always say we're the land's newest saviors, eh?  Might be a discount in that?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well...someday we may need to lean into that persona a bit, but for now let us keep a modest profile. It would not do the swagger just yet."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran shrugs, smiling.  Waving to the woman shop-keep, the group leaves to make their way to the Queen's Smile.  Along the way, they pass through the market again, basking in the glory that is elven art.  Farther north, where the rainbow-hued road branches in a few dozen directions around a circle, the road north is a golden hue, with the sign posted <i>Sun Walk</i> in beautiful etching.  Daran trudges along the golden road, taking in the sights and sounds.  Eventually the group comes to a finely decorated two-story building.  Trees and gardens surround the entire building, mixing with the aromas carried on the soft breeze.   The first floor, around the entrance, has elegant outdoor dining areas, and the second floor has a balcony where customers are already laughing and chattering gaily.  A great sense of peace and calm exudes from the place, making Maouelue wonder if the whole building isn't magically charmed some way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue smiles and leads on to the restaurant's entrance, indicating they would like a table for four outdoors. Their friends would arrive after awhile.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A spry young elf lad hop-skips through the indoor seating to get the group a nice table outside.  As the sunshine warms faces, Maouelue is able to rest for the first time in what seems like a very, <i>very</i> long time.  Breads and some spreads come out, and the spry elf gives both men magically laminated parchment menus.  The waiter says, "Welcome to the Queen's Smile.  We have the menu options as well as a curated, four-course meal, if you would prefer.  Please let me know I there's anything I can do for your.  Would you like to start off with something to drink?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"As it is my first time here, I would defer to the chef's discretion. Such is my custom. However, we were directed to order the Baked Chaos Sunfish and the Goldflower Buns, so let us put in two orders of those to come out after awhile. My friends will return with carriage and an appetite! As for beverage, what nectar of the local flower do you have on offer?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter bows low and says, "Welcome to our humble restaurant, then, travelers.  The Elverquisst is a must, if you haven't had it before.  And I guarantee, even if you've had it elsewhere, even on another plane, it is much different here."  He smiles.  "A bottle for the table, yes?"  Maouelue sees the Elverquisst is 40 gold.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us have at! Treats all round!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter bows low again, then hastens away to the kitchens.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are a lot of conversations going on around the group.  Between the crowd in the streets and the patronage of the food-house, Maouelue's senses are hard-pressed to find a line of conversation that sticks out.  There is one table that is a few over from the party that is talking in animated, hushed tones.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue leans in to Daran slightly and whisper under his breath, "Can you catch what they're saying over there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran closes his eyes and looks to be in meditation.  The cacophony swells.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His eyes open wide, and his mouth gapes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Cautious not to overreact, Maouelue raises and eyebrow questioningly at Daran.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well.  They're very interested in us.  But it seems that there is another new arrival to the city.  Or maybe not so new..." Daran frowns, trying to piece it all together.  "They are workers near the docks.  They said there is a ship that's supposedly been asea for over 90 years that's just put into port.  Most of them are scoffing, but there's one that recognizes the name.  And confirms it's over 100 years old.  Odd that, right?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"To be fair it is hard to know what is novel in this land, especially after your note about the passage of time here. Could it be that the ship also had some extra-planar experience?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Could be, true.  Haven't heard about any crossovers in the waters, but it would beg to reason there should be, aye."   He trails off, thinking.</p><p></p><p>The waiter comes back with two bottles and a sliced loaf of bread on a cutting board.  "Here we are, the goldflower bread, freshly baked.  It pairs excellently with our pixie spreads.  The chaos sauce is particularly nasty, so I brought a sample of it here, just in case either of you would like to try it before the main course comes."  He gives a sly chuckle.  "I have here the Elverquisst, aged and bottled right here in Faerie.  And this is a bottle of Feywild wine.  A standard here, but since you are from beyond, please accept the chef's gift to you, our travelling guests!"  He makes a show of presenting the bottle to Maouelue, then, with many flourishes, draws and pours the Elverquisst.  The ramekin of chaos sauce is sending up little sparks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods respectfully to the server, waits for his retreat, then begins to sample a bit of everything.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bread is fluffy and light, and soaks up anything put on it or dipped in.  Maouelue and Daran try the chaos sauce together.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And they are both very pleased with it!  Daran's not overly fond of high spice, and it is rare to find many elves that are, but the taste and the heat pair well together.  The two settle in to the wine as well.  The first sip goes to Maouelue's head, but he's able to shake away the centered effect.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, on the other hand, pauses for a few moments, drink halfway to set on the table.  A good 30 seconds later, Daran closes his eyes and shakes his head.  Then looks at Maouelue and laughs!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Some vintage!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Quite pleasant indeed!” Maouelue states cooly. </p><p>“I wonder when that carriage will arrive. It sounds like we’ll be riding in style eh there Daran?” He slaps him on the back with a air of friendly banter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran smiles and he tucks into more food.  The waiter arrives again, bringing a frilly plate of appetizers piled high.  "Enjoy!" he says with a flourish and bow, and promptly exits.  Murmurs from around the assembled patrons catch the pairs attention, and they look down the street to see a large, golden carriage pulled by four stark white draft horses.  If it were full sunlight, the scene would be blinding.  But in the seemingly forever late evening sunlight, it is resplendent in a golden aura, an orange-hued halo surrounding everything.  Some of the elves in attendance stand and clap, believing a member of the Court to be inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What did I tell you! Riding in style.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks in slack-jawed horror between the people clapping, the carriage, the opulent scene unfolding before him.  The guard that suggested the restaurant hops is marching at the front of the procession.  He sees the group, waves, and makes his way over, the horses being driven around to a more sequestered location.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter comes out again, this time with the fish, and the guard lets out a little yelp.  He thanks the waiter, sits down to tuck in, and says, "Thank you gentlemen most kindly.  This is truly a treat."  To the other guard, he says, "Did I miss anything?"  The other shakes their head and stands at attention off to the side, taking his job extremely seriously.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage stops in front of the shop and Bellatrix and her sister step out.  They both give Maouelue mischievous grins and start making their way into the restaurant.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Well, this just keeps getting better and better,</i> he smiles to himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A twinkle of the crows foot, a cool gesture with an outstretched palm.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix grasps the hand as she passes by, into the main part of the restaurant.  Daran arches an eyebrow and smiles, shaking his head.  The guard is making loud slurping sounds, making some around them turn to look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The waiter comes out with two large plates, on which roasted half birds sit, surrounded by flowers and vegetables.  "Enjoy," he says again, bowing and flourishing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue stands up and begins to toast his company a bit ostentatiously, eyeing fleetingly the various groups around the room as he does so, monitoring their responses in a bit of a baiting manner. They are making a scene here and he wants the onlookers to know also that they are seen. </p><p></p><p>“My friends! Thank you for gathering here with me on this fine day. The best bottles and bottles to each of you, oh companions of renown. Though the eyes of our foes be many, the resolve of our hearts be true! Long live Queen Titania and Lord Oberon, and may our friendship and kinship be renewed and strengthened as we fight for the heart of this city!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us raise our glasses to, those who have fallen,  those  who are falling, and those who teeter on the precipice.” At this last, he lets his eyes linger on the hushed group he and Daran had been monitoring, nearly imperceptibly nodding his head in their direction before returning his gaze to Bellatrix and the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Applause bursts out from the surrounding tables, cackling from the sister, and general merriment at the boisterous words.  Bellatrix gives Maouelue a wry smile and a tilt of the head, as if in wonder of what his plans hold next.  Several waiters come out to fill empty and empty-ing goblets and glasses.  Even the crowd outside of the restaurant gets in on the positive attitude, some even entering the establishment because of it.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The table Daran overheard is eyeing all of your group <i>hard</i>.  Not in an overly menacing way at all, just extremely curious and being very obvious about it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are five people in all, four men and a woman.  All look to be either spring eladrin or run-of-the-mill elves.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue leans over to one of his handlers and mentions as much, asking whether these folks are known to the palace guard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one eating checks what Maouelue says, but is very careful not to give away too much.  With a boisterous yell and a flamboyant show, he pours more wine for everyone, getting up and offering his seat to the older sister.  Who sits in it with a giggle/cackle.  A gackle, if you will.  As the guard moves around the table, filling drinks, his eyes move deftly over the group.  He pulls a chair out at a nearby empty table for Bellatrix, then sits himself opposite, directly behind Maouelue.  Without a beat, the wizard hears behind him in a low whisper, "The woman is Tinebrae, works at a seedier tavern by the docks.  The husky one is Maradeim, the blonde one is Tannivh.  Both work in warehouses by the docks.  The other two I don't know.  Do you require something from them, lord wizard?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Fill them a round of the wine and send my blessings."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The... ah...  the Elverquisst, my lord?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Astonished, the guard nods and goes to find the waiter.  Moments later, a yell comes up from the other table as the wine is presented and the waiter explains the table's good fortune.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue raises his glass and catches their eyes, in a pantomime toast.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men are pretty inebriated already, but the woman eyes Maouelue cautiously.  She turns to her group, says something, and the rest of them scoff, raising their glasses high and enjoying the present.  The woman, frustrated, folds her arms and stews.  She continues to look back and forth, secretively, between the two tables.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The magnanimous metal mage meanders over to the meddling meetup he's monitoring.</p><p>"Fine day my fellow! Enjoy the wine, I did not want our revelry to encroach upon your table's experience negatively." At these last words he looks hard at the frowning woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men speak up at once, jumping up and patting Maouelue on the back, offering him a seat.  </p><p>"Hey now, lad!"</p><p>"Thank you for the vintage!"</p><p>"For the heart of the city!" </p><p>"To the Queen and King!"</p><p>"Long live the Court!"</p><p>Their exuberance is caught by other tables, and the revelry heightens. </p><p>The dour woman gives Maouelue a half-smile.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come now, let us have a song in memory of this moment!" Maouelue looks around for some of the attending musicians and calls for a Fey ley to be sung by all.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A fresh-faced bard gets shoved towards the group.  He has a hand harp.  That's slightly out of tune.  The heckles start right away from the group of dock workers.  The bard, sheepishly, starts playing an ode to the day.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although nervous, he plays decently, if a bit blandly.  The story is of heroes on a mighty quest searching for the lost elven bow of The Prince of Frost.  One of the dock workers boo him and ask if anyone knows about the tale of the Dôlgubalak.  The woman slaps the man in the shoulder, hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She whispers something acidically under her breath.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dôlgubalak you say? Aye let's hear that but after! I'm a sucker for a frosty Elven bow, I must confess."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bard stammers and balks, the harp twangs reluctantly.  The boos increase, but at the encouragement of Maouelue, people pipe down and pay attention to the story.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Unfortunately it's a meandering mish-mash of love story and romance novelette, a juvenile sordid tale.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something about it being buried with his true love.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue tries to hear what the woman says, but just misses it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks pretty mad though.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The fresh elf finishes his song to a smattering of applause.  A super fan yells behind him somewhere, and he bows off, blushing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another bard comes up, this one an autumn eladrin, bronze skin shining in the evening light.  She has a beautifully crafted lute, and she hums up to the edge of the restaurant's outdoor seating to a smattering of claps.  </p><p>In a heavy brogue, the eladrin bard says in a loud voice, "Did I hear someone want to know the tale of the Black Ship of the Shee Alus, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Applause from most of the tables.  Every one except Maouelue's new friends.  Silence comes from them.  A few of them even look... scared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Play on mistress!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bard gets a glint in her eye.  She bows to Maouelue, then picks up a sea shanty rhythm and tempo.  The crowd starts stomping along, clapping in time with the beat as the woman gets into a groove...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An amazing thing happens as she starts to sing.  Maouelue sees the reality of what's happening, but another layer, like a film across his eyes, show him the happenings of her words.</p><p></p><p>She tells of a group of elves, power hungry and hell-bent on ruling the waters of the Feywild.  These peoples made their slaves create a mighty ship, black as obsidian with black sails to match.  It looked like a thunderhead as it rode the waves, and in a storm, is was completely hidden.  It manned many wizards who controlled the weather, to make it storm around their black ship at all times.  And with that dire boat, they ruled the oceans of the Fey.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Until one day, they met with a more powerful fiend.  From the depths it rose, chasing, then catching the mariners and their formidable craft.  In an instant, they were cast asunder, forever lost to the sea.  They only reason people knew of this tale is because the black ship was never seen on the waves again.  Peace came to the harbors and islands.  Life was sweet.  But every once in a while, people say they can hear the music of the boat, drifting in from the deep waters.  Singing of doom from the pirates below the sea.  And their new god.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a minor chord and a final bow, the woman closes her song to silence.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue slowly stands and begins to applaud. “Enchanting...madam.” He flips her a gold coin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the group starts to clap until a full rousing chorus of applause comes into bloom.  Coins start cascading at her feet, and she bows again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, Tinebrae jumps up from the table and runs into the main restaurant, nearly knocking over a couple waiters bringing more food out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow her.” Maouleue whispers to the slick handler. Don’t worry, we’ll get you a box.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The elf nods, wipes his mouth, excuses himself to Bellatrix, and hastens away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bard retires from the spotlight, the street calms down to a relative normal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue and the group continue with their meal, the mage keeping an ear on the other group all the time now, as he makes pleasantries with the rest. After a while he calls for the tab and says they must be on their way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tab is produced, putting the mage out 200 gold.  (Daran helps out, too!)  They all start to disperse, running into the guard on their way out of The Queen's Smile.  Approaching Maouelue, he says, "She went into the kitchens, they won't let me in there.  I did look in, though, and she's sitting on a crate by the back door.  Might be able to go around, if you wish to speak with her, lord wizard."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Perhaps I will. Yes, perhaps I will. Pray take the others to the carriage. I will be along shortly.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short salute and he leads them away, promising the carriage will be waiting on the street for the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The wizard treks around to the back, taking down his ostentatious manner...as much as possible. There’s something about this situation that intrigues him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue makes his way to the rear of the building.  No one really marks his progress, but he does stand out.  A bit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The birds are chirping, the sun is...  still setting.  Maouelue hiccups.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Squirrel.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans up against the wall. “This was a good idea. Yup. Good idea.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, the back door opens dramatically.  The sullen woman steps out and starts walking away, weeping quietly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tinebrae...that is your name, is it not?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman jumps, startled.  Crying has ceased for the moment as she gets her bearings.  After a few seconds, she says, in a soft voice, "Yes.  My name is Tinebrae.  Why are you back here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I couldn’t help but note your interest in our party. Why do you flee?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There’s nothing to fear from me, I promise.” He holds his hands up in a show of peace. 🙌🏻</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He rubs his hand on the back of his head and stutters.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes go a bit sharp and she takes a step backward, toward the main street.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I had a row with a friend.  And that song made me...  uncomfortable.  That's all.  A bad memory from my childhood.  Thank you for worrying.  I'm feeling much better now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’m sorry to pry. I shouldn’t...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Please excuse me.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns to leave.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wait!" she yells!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns back.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks back and forth down the back alley.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You're new to this city, yes?  And to the Feywilds as well?  There have been some very strange things happening lately, and I'm not sure if you're coming here is one or not.  Pardon my bluntness, but in my line of work, it's best to be open about what's at stake.  If you catch my meaning."  She looks down at her scuffed boots, shyly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed. Go on.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The boat, the black ship the bard sang of?  It is docked at the wharf <i>right now</i>.  I've seen it.  It came in last night, late.  A few folk went to investigate, on a dare for the love of the gods...  but they never came back.  Some say the entire thing is empty, but it's huge.  Not a person has disembarked, either.  There's a legend that says 'first the ship comes back, then the god follows'.  And, frankly...  I'm scared to see what happens next."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dark tidings abound of late. Thank you for your words of caution. I may have cause to investigate ere long. Would it be forward of me to call on you at your establishment? Could you keep an eye on the activity around that ship?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She seems surprised.  This woman is unused to someone looking out for the greater good, so she's cautious.  At the same time, she nods and says, "Yes.  I'll keep an eye.  And you can call on me at the Oaken Grove.  I'm usually there in the evenings."  She steps closer.  "Thank you, stranger."  She smiles, then runs off down the alley to the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He watches her on down the alley, considering her words, then turns and slowly starts off to rejoin with the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage awaits at the end of the street, ready to ride.  Daran sits on the sidebar, smoking a pipe.  He waves when he sees you.  "Anything interesting?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“In a minute...” He looks around a moment, then ushers into the carriage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hastily spills out his bowl and stows the pipe, hopping into the cab.  A snap and the horses move off.  Bellatrix smiles at Maouelue, then looks worried at his countenance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As soon as the clatter from the ride creates ample noise, he starts in with the others about the black ship and his encounter with Tinebrae.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old woman's eyes get large and she starts giggling, then cackling, then fully laughing outright, unnerving the others in the cart.  Bellatrix reaches out for her sister, "Honestly, Benna!  What's gotten into you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, the ghost ship a-comes!  The ghost ship a-comes!!  Hee hee!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue idly fondles a trio of platinum balls as he considers this, twirling them around in his left hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Driver, please take us South out of the city. We aim for Lanrion's Tower."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Padron me all, while I consider these tomes and scrolls. Feel free to pass them amongst yourselves along the way. We should steep ourselves in the lore of this place if we are to survive."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins by taking out the scrolls and copying them over to his spellbook excitedly. He would take some time to practice and prepare these when he could.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Charm Person added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Jump added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Lightning Bolt added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Expeditious Retreat added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Frost Fingers added to known spell list!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carriage driver salutes behind to Maouelue, cracks the whip, and the horses jaunt off at a high trot.  Bellatrix still gives you an odd, worried look, but then gets interested in the books offered.  Daran and Benna also sift through them, checking out what they are all about.  The trip to the south of the city, to Lanrion's Tower, starts in earnest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The countryside is steeped in autumnal colors.  Just south of the city proper, a vista opens up in front of the group and all can see a wide expanse of land, dotted with copses of trees and lovely elven buildings rising into the air.  And beyond...  the sea.  An amazing, glistening stretch of water opens up before the party's eyes.  Farther, across the sea, Maouelue can see a white area off to the SE, marking the borders of the Pale Prince's domain.  And immediately south, a scruffy forest of evergreen and deciduous trees marking the famed wilderness of the Feywild.  On the edge of the island, in the direction they're headed, stands a spire that cuts the skyline like a razor.  It shimmers between the sunlight bouncing off the water and the setting sun beams from the west.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Approximately four hours later, as Maouelue finishes his first transcription, the horses whinny to a stop and the carriage doors open to let the party exit.  Once outside their ride, they see the razor tower in all it's glory.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group travels all around the base of the tower, trying to find a way in.  There is none.  But there is a balcony jutting out forty feet up on the south-facing side, looking out onto the Fey sea.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue asks his guards whether they know anything of this place.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The drivers shake their heads.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The foodie guard comes up behind Maouelue and says, "Tales tell of an old wizard that lives in the tower.  He likes his solitude too much, so his tower is nigh impenetrable.  Do either of you have any knowledge of the arcane about you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The metal mage casts a withering eye at the guard. “<i>Aye</i>.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He chuckles and realizes what he just said.  "Aye, yes.  True.  That's my fault, apologies lord wizard.  Ah...  My understanding is that Old Lanrion recognizes arcane arts.  He's locked his tower with arcane locks and the only way either call him or announce our presence is to...  perform magic, as it were.  That is the length of my knowledge, saer."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue doesn’t say a word he judy’s writes down his enchantment order for the greaves on a spare page of his diary then sends a mage hand upward to carry it and grab Larison’s attention.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh for crying out loud.” He pulls his quarterstaff out of his bag and affixes the note onto the end, then has the hand go hold it up as high as possible trying to peek over the ledge.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Someday I’ll have to learn how to cast Mage’s Cock, then we wouldn’t have this problem...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No one comes to the balcony, nothing happens around the base of the tower.  There is silence around save for the lapping of the water on the nearby sandy shore.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The rest of you, feel free to wander about. I have business with the wizard here. See you after a while.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue sits down to a ritual facing outward over the water. He seeks around for a meandering bat or hawk, focusing his energies on the environment around him, calling out to the fae of the land.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sits for a spell, the others stay busy looking for a way in.  After a time, a beautiful brown and white hawk flies from the forest across the sea and lands in front of the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There now mighty huntress, blessings be upon you for lending your service to me.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>e is not a valid integer.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>e is not a valid integer.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Screech</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Now go up there and find me a wizard.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue enters his trance again and watches through the hawk’s eye.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Screech screech</i></p><p>The hawk flies to the balcony and lands on the hand railing.  She screeches again, loudly.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue, looking through the hawk's eyes, sees a doorway into the tower, but there is a shimmer to it.  Casting his gaze through the door, pushing his will to look through the haze, the wizard can tell it needs more magic.  (Arcana check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Get it together Lumao!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can pierce the veil a bit, seeing through the shimmery gauze in the doorway.  It looks to be a large library, rows and rows of books line the walls.  Nothing living can be seen beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue calls the hawk back to keep an eye on him while he begins inscribing the Jump spell in his book, practicing his leaps with the help of his new boots as well. Overall feeling pretty good about the process and meanwhile completely oblivious to his party’s going’s on.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He grabs a few jumping bugs from around the edge of the water and pulls their legs to use as reagents for his tests. </p><p><i>Hip...</i></p><p><i>Hop...</i></p><p><i>Hibbie...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue takes a running jump and lands on the balcony, swinging his legs over smoothly.  He can hear clapping below.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He swells with a bit of misplaced bravado and turns and waves back over the balcony, lapping up the applause  and gleaming in his metal suit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Quickly turning, he heads back now to the veil, patting himself on the back and chucking his spell.</p><p><i>Be your own guide, metal mage! Heh heh...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage turns back to the doorway, determined.  He's getting a much better look now, and can clearly see that there is a magical essence to the barrier.  The hawk screeches below, Daran yells something Maouelue can't quite make out.  He reaches out a hand to the veil.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just as his hand is about to touch the haze, the shimmering lifts, dissipates, disappears.   Behind it is a dark room.  Gone are the books, the library.  A spiral staircase can be seen with a little landing just beyond the doorway.  Standing on the landing is an old elven man.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Doctor Lanrion, I presume?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Long white hair pours from his head and face, making him look ancient for an elf.  His skin has a dusky pallor, a few liver spots dotting his face.  His back is slightly hunched. He's grasping a clear crystal staff tightly with both hands.  His mouth chews on something.  He looks frustrated, but curious too.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a voice like the opening of a dusty, ancient tome, he says, "I have never been called Doctor before, lad.  A moniker I quite enjoy, actually.  Quite a feat of athleticism, getting up on my balcony.  Why didn't you just knock?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“‘‘Tis for the thrush to knock upon the door. That of the Metal Mage marks many mirrored masks.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old wizened wizard contemplates for a moment.  He smiles, and says, "We can always learn a thing or two from nature.  Even thrushes.  Come.  The tea is getting cold."  And he walks down the circular stairs, inside the his tower.</p><p></p><p>(Gonna pause it there for tonight, my good sir.  I'm loving where this is going, by the way.  I know it's a bit slower than the fight scenes, but it's so much fun to rp with all of these folks!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old elven man makes his way slowly down the spiral stairs.  At the bottom, a small table is set with seven seats and a pot of steaming tea.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard reaches the bottom of the tower, the staircase rising seemingly to infinity above the two of you, he approaches the side wall and places a gnarled hand on it.  A doorway appears and opens outward, admitting the rest of the group.  They start cautiously coming in as Lanrion starts pouring tea for everyone.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue smiles kindly at their bewildered faces. “Come friends, let us take our tea with the host of this tower. Master Lanrion, though, <i>Doctor Lanrion</i> is fast catching on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard chuckles as he pours more cups.  "<i>I</i> would like it, yes.  But patrons might not when they realize I cannot help them with their common colds, or various afflictions.  That is, I cannot help them... without magic."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He finishes, offers the seats with a wave, and places the pot in the air behind him.  It vanishes as he sits and says, "So, what brings your fine company to an old man's door today?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well good wizard, there are long and short answers to that question. I’ll begin with the latter. I was told that your enchanting services are unparalleled and if I wanted to ‘go big’ as it were, that this was the place to come. As you no doubt have noticed, I am a bit more metallic than other arcanists you may have come across. However, I lack a bit of...covering in a key area. I’ve commissioned a set of platinum greaves, in reverence of my patron...I seek to have them imbued with a balance of strength and intelligence, for that lust which drives one in battle must be tempered by a cool head.” He cannot help but flick his eyes over to Bellatrix during this last. “The long answer, perhaps my company here can help to elaborate, but let us say, that if you were to render these services, your help would be felt a great deal beyond just those you see here today, for there are powers afoot that all who claim to be agents of good would do well to refute.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Random slurping and sipping sounds greet the silence after Maouelue's statement.  Lanrion nods contemplatively.  The witch's eye flit between all members of the party, trying to take everything in.  The guards, who did not sit, stand in awkward quiet behind the troupe.  Daran looks out of place and a bit nervous, while Benna...  is trying to hold in laughter.  Or gas.</p><p></p><p>Lanrion sweeps his gaze around to all, landing last on Maouelue.  "Thank you for your candor, Metal Mage."  He smiles.  "I have had success in enchanting.  And other arcane arts, in truth.  I'm a big fan of history, too.  Did you know, the very place we're sitting used to be the site of a major event in Feywild history?  It's true," he looks seriously around the group.  "It is right here that the Pale Prince tore out his heart.  Some say that, when his love sailed across the sea, with the Queen of Ravens, he clutched his own chest, ripped the heart out of his very body, and buried it in the ground.  Isn't that interesting?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Interesting is quite a word; says everything while fully saying nothing. We keep hearing tell of this Pale Prince as it would so happen. Have a few tomes along with us, matter of fact. Strange we would be led right to the, forgive the punnery, <i>heart</i> of it all so directly.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tell me, is there any part of the story that involves a black ship?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And mind, all of you, pipe in if you wish.” He surveys Benna as he says this.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna is sitting on her hands, rocking back and forth, looking utterly crazy and very much at home.  The rest are in rapt fascination between the two of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Black ship, black heart...  One in the same, yes?  And the pun is forgiven, goodsir.  I wouldn't hold a pun against even my worst enemy.  Now, you were saying about the enchanting.  You need your armor strengthened against...  battle rage?  Or would you just need them to give you a boost to your will?"  (Insight check, if you want!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ahem, well, I had imagined this conversation would be a bit less well-attended, but I'll try to be frank. When the...head gets a rush of blood in the heat of battle, the brain would do well to remain sane. Something to bolster the blood supply...perhaps a boon of intelligence to keep my wits."</p><p></p><p>The mage awkwardly tries to explain himself in front of his company.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The story is a strange one," the wizard fairly wheezes out.  Benna giggles, softly.  "The Pale Prince used to be the Sun Prince, once upon the day.  His love of a follower of his was his undoing.  She eventually turned to love another.  Maybe it was something the Prince did.  Who is to say.  All I know is that outside my balcony, to the southeast, I am privy to his pain.  Every day."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He pardons himself, gets up, and conjures a wizard's laboratory against the wall.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell me, kind woman, what do you know of enchantments?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue looks at the newly conjured workstation...  and it off-put by it.  Not sure why, though.  Something is hitting him as odd.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks back and forth between her party-mates, but Benna gets up and goes to Lanrion's side.  "Oh, my, a bit here, a bit there!  Lessee what ya got, sonny!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard laughs at that and the two set to going through beakers and vials, random bit and bobs from his table.  All with their backs turned.  Bellatrix stares at Maouelue, giving him a look that says, <i>What in the Nine Hells is happening right now?!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leans in and whispers a reply. “Apologies dear Bellatrix, i had not sought to tie everyone up with this endeavor, but I felt the need to gather resources before heading out again. Pray, let us watch what your sister and Lanrion concoct here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and says in a whisper, "I'm not worried at all, I can't remember the last time I've seen Benna have so much fun!  He does switch topics quite frequently, though!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Wizards...” He replies with a wink.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tittering comes from the workbench, and the wizard starts mixing things in vials.   Puffs of smoke erupt, and more laughter ensues.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lanrion turns in a flourish, and says, "Dear boy, have you any item - jewelry or the like - very near and dear to your heart?  Not bound to your armor or any weaponry?"</p><p>Benna comes back to the table with a brewed concoction, giggling and staring between Maouelue and Lanrion.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“There was, at the start of our journey, a young Halfling called Briffo Lightfoot...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All lean forward, in expectation.  The wizard nods, almost imperceptibly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...when hope was high, our search beginning. There was no ransom to be paid. But, the heists they came at night, as we delved the Muhlen Manor; as we tore the place apart, as they turned our greed to shame. </p><p></p><p>We laid him down by riverside. With words we teared admist our blunders. <i>They took our Brightfoot in his striiiiiide!!!</i> So to the vault, we took our shame.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“But still...I dream he’ll always see, the ways his sacrifice was tendered. He drifts beyond the endless sea...</p><p></p><p>...his life has filled the dreams I dream.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With this, Maouleue pulls forth the Ring of Aid, his final material remains from Briffo’s fleeting existence in his world. The thought floods over him, as he pursues so called forces of justice, what is he leaving in the wake? How many lost? Too many...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...Dieter...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Be strong.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The last he says aloud, an icy tear crystallizing into the crows feet developing at the corner of his eye through years of scrutiny and intense attention to detail, and well, a bit of light-hearted reverie along the way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>But the costs had never been so high as now. Thus his mission here. He must retain focus at all costs. The mission here with his half brother would have to wait. For now. It was time to fulfill their contract and the sooner he could get this bit of whimsy sorted, the better. His fingers fiddle idly with the Expeditious Retreat scroll he had been looking forward to studying.</p><p></p><p>He turns back expectantly to Lanrion and Benna.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard's eyes take on a softer, knowing cast.  Lanrion nods his head again as he picks up the ring.  "Yes.  Yes, this will do well."  He's looking at Maouelue when he says this, then sits down next to him at the tea table.  </p><p>"The thing about sacrifice is that, for it to be truly understood, truly <i>sacrificial</i>, no one can know of it.  It can't be broadcast to the heavens.  There shouldn't be grand gestures.  It often times is just people.  Going about their business, making the difficult choices.  Doing what they can as they must.  And when posed with a difficult task or decision, always choosing the harder road.  Not because it is hard, but because it is right.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The interesting thing about you and your friends is that, although you might not know it yet, your choices and actions will effect the world for years and years to come.  There are some things coming you cannot and will not change.  But, for your part, there are important, world changing things you can affect.  Just by choosing right.  For example, the reason you wear that armor.  Had you not chosen the Platinum Protector, there might be a real chance a choice in your future could be swayed another way.  I say this not to worry your, or question your allegiances.  Simply to inform you of the importance of perseverance.  And of hope.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Without the belief that what you do <i>means</i> something, even to just one person, your choices are then random, as is your effect on the warp and weft of the world.  But you, sir...  your actions mean something.  Sometimes, yes, to just one person.  And other times to people you will never get the chance to meet."  He looks sorrowfully down at the ring in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue nods stoically, taking in this wisdom.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes the ring and puts it round his index finger on his right hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As soon as Maouelue touches the ring, he feels different.  He can't pinpoint it, but does feel different that he had before.  </p><p></p><p>"Two more things.  One, strength and intelligence will get you far.  But, for the long road, you might find that your greatest need is a strong spine and a deeper understanding of things.</p><p></p><p>(The ring gives you +4 Wis, +2 Int, and +4 Con)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Lastly, I believe your biggest fear can be allayed with this...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lanrion waves his hand at the wall and a picture comes, crystal clear, upon it.  It is a moving picture, complete with sound.  It is of a young bearded man, of whom Maouelue is familiar with.  A gigantic snail comes up from behind him, but it looks friendly to the man.  Another man comes into the picture, dressed in common clothes.  In his hands, a specially made sword-staff.  He is looking intently at a tapestry that Maouelue can see bears a skull in a triangle setting, all on a black background.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dieter...</p><p></p><p>Can it be? </p><p></p><p>And with Frumious to boot! Looks like our dear Druid is not without hope after all!</p><p></p><p>And what of this symbol....the trinity of death...</p><p></p><p>But fear not, says the wise wizard before me. I am aided and abetted, now I see that I had better be off and offer my aid!</p><p></p><p>Something is odd though...Frumious..., why would he rejoin? Hadn't he stolen off with quite a bit if Platinum hence. What circumstances could put the two back together within the Citadel, if that is where they truly  sit now.</p><p></p><p>The pair look amicable enough...ah, but I ramble...</p><p></p><p>How is it that you can show me this? How is it that you know?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lanrion pats the younger wizard on the shoulder.  "Perhaps, when all of this is over, you can join me over another cup of tea.  There is much more I would share with you."  He smiles, then conjures the teapot again to freshen cups.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue seaches the wizard's face. For a moment, he is reminded of Shi'Vandos, far away, through the veil, back in his academy tower, listening to an adage about the difference between tales and trails. It is a well-timed reminder to keep his head. Something about the Feywild...</p><p></p><p><i>His eyes drift over to Bellatrix as he contemplates.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She's still watching the moving picture on the wall.  Benna hiccups and giggle.  Daran has gotten up to speak with the guards.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The young wizard walks over to her, clearing his throat gently as he approaches. </p><p></p><p>"What do you make of it Bella?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head to the side, still watching the wall.  "It's old magic.  He seems to know what he's talking about, too.  Do you think we could convince him to join us?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks to Mao with smirk.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Something tells me this old elf goes when and where he pleases."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She laughs.  Daran comes back behind the chairs of the two and says, "Sounds like we should be going.  Queen wants to talk to us soon, brief us on the raid.  We good here, Maouelue?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes indeed. I am sorry for my indulgence. Let’s us away.”</p><p></p><p>“Lanrion, thank you for your wisdom. I will meet you in the future for that follow-up tea.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old wizard gets up, escorting everyone to his door.  "The pleasure would be all mine.  And when you do meet back up with your friend, don't make a big deal of his new pet."  He pats Maouelue on the shoulder.  "Please feel free to come back, any time."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue wonders at the meaning of the former, but keeps it to himself. “We’ll see you again. Goodbye.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads them back over to the coach and this time stays intent on his companions rather than himself, laughing about their sojourn. It has been a nice change of pace, though their next moves were bound to be fraught with danger.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone packs up and loads out, the old wizard stands waiving while the coach pulls away.  Maouelue is able to get one more spell in his book before the carriage arrives back at Starlight Castle.  They're ushered out and guards guide them to another room just off of the throne room.  As the group enters, a large map is unfurled on the table, magic is giving it a three-dimensional view.  The southern forests and their large bushy trees blend into the massive maze in the West.  The sea glistens in the North, just beyond the City of Starlight.  The Queen and King are huddled over the map, pointing at several areas, while another lithe summer eladrin in battle armor, helm off, stands next to them, taking in their direction.  They all notice the group coming in.  The Queen's servants usher everyone to seats, deliver drinks, and the meeting starts in earnest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen begins, "Thank you all for joining us, I know it's late.  After a much needed rest, we are planning for the full raid.  There has been a slight change of plans.  After speaking with our head of the military, Jelentrianna, we have decided a direct strike to a major base would be the best route.  If we can take out a major general and raze one of their dominant bases, it would go a long way to turn the tide.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'll let Jelentrianna explain more."  She steps back to let the armored eladrin address the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"According to our most recently acquired information from the front, the main insurrection base is Mag Tureah, which is directly south of here, and close to the Plains of Echoing Thunder.  We have reason to believe that across from the seelie city of Cendriane, SE of the city to be specific, and S of the Stream, is a new underground base.  It is starting to grow considerably because the unseelie are planning on taking the eastern side of the Feywild.  Our capital, Senaliesse, the City of Stars, would be in a direct line of danger if this were to happen.  If we quell the burgeoning base now, we could potentially save two seelie cities in one go."  She looks expectantly around.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And here we have it, the raid of a lifetime. I am ready for this challenge as I am ready to take to the battlefield again with you lot. Let a hammerstroke fall upon the unseelie and send a rebuffing wave back across the sound. </p><p></p><p>What do we know of its defenses?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The captain nods vigorously, "Great point, glad we're thinking in the same vein.  According to our intel, there are barracks there, plus gods know what kinds of monsters.  We have narrowed the number of actual eladrin down to 60.  And that's so far.  Haven't been able to get anyone inside yet, might not be able to.  They're locking things down pretty hard.  But I would guess, from what I've been told about your previous bout, a lot of the same.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There is going to be three teams, twenty soldiers each.  We're examining the entry points, but three are confirmed.  This is going to be a smash-and-go, get in and get out, do as much damage as possible and raze the place to the ground when we're done.  We need to send a big message, and a massacre will do just that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Receiving encouragement all around, bolstering her resolve, Jelentrainna continues.  "There are two north passages.  The NE passage we'll openly attack, sending shock troops in a hopefully drawing the better part of the fighting.  Then we'll send two more groups in, stealthily, one through the NW passage, and another through the SE, which has some water hazards.  Don't know if you all want to stay together or lead your own battalions, but there are options for either.  I would not put any of you in the first group, everyone here would be better utilized as a merc.  Any questions so far?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue turns to Daran, "You will lead a troop through the Southeast passage. Bellatrix, we shall take the Northwest passage. Lady Brenna, would you go or  stay?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, I'm not much use in a fight, nowadays.  But I'll be sure to get you all set up before you go," Benna says, regretfully.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran gives a quick head nod.  Bellatrix seems...  (Insight check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks like she's keeping her emotions in check, trying not to let anything show on her face.  Her eyes, however, belie the fact that she's extremely scared.  Maouelue can't quite tell what she's terrified of.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Noting this, he addresses them all, "If there are objections or alternatives, I will of course, hear them out."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran shifts, looks like he's debating with himself.  Then, after a deep breath, he says, "I'm no captain or leader like that.  I appreciate your vote of confidence, and I'd be happy to check in at the other post, Maouelue.  But I think I would be happier as a soldier than a commander.  If that's okay?"</p><p></p><p>Bellatrix tries to catch Maouelue's eye, but doesn't speak up.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Understood Daran, you are of course welcome to join our company. Bellatrix if there is aught you have to say, I would hear of it..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Startled, she looks around nervously at all of the faces.  (Persuasion check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He puts his right hand to his forehead and mutters something under his breath...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>...then puts his left on her shoulder, in a comforting gesture.</p><p></p><p>"My lady, please, be not afraid."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She... flips... out.  Screaming and running from the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna is the first to react, running after her sister.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the dignitaries look between themselves.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ahhhm, was is something I said?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen says, "Um...  I'm sorry if i was something <i>we</i> posited, too."  She calls a staff member to have them check on Bellatrix.  She then turns back to the group.  "There is one more piece of happy news, but we can wait while we attend to other matters, yes?   We will take a brief recess, would that be okay, Maouelue?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"No, please. Give me the happy news. Maybe it will prove of use..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen smiles, bows her head, and says, "Maybe it would be best coming from the source."  She turns to beckon from the other room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The quartet of Erifias, Otirnis, Cierean, and Cruiver come out and stand at attention next to their captain, Jelentrianna.  All of them wear wide smiles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>At this Maouleue's curiosity is peaked and his confusion at Bella's reaction is temporarily swept aside.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The captain begins, "The recoveries of Erifias and Cruiver have been top notch.  They specifically requested to be on the next mission with you.  I have assigned them to your detail, lord wizard.  If that is amenable to ye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Have they indeed! That is most welcome news. I would be honored to fight beside them once more."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And what of you Otirnis and Cierean? What are your intentions?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Erifias steps forward and says, "My whole team is ready to fight, lord wizard.  They are all in agreement."  Four faces beam at the group around the table.  Maouelue gets the feeling that the highest of the guard is being picked for this mission, and this team very much wants to be considered in that rank.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out his hands to the center of the group. "Take my hands all of you. May the light and life of the lord guide us."</p><p></p><p>He lowers his head and begins to channel his spirit of guidance through the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you all, from the whole of my heart. Never shall I forget this day."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us all now make our final preparations ere we head out to the front!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone is slightly taken aback, but very enthusiastic as they all grasp hands, then glow with the light of Maouelue's magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>At this Maouelue turns and walks tentatively toward the direction of Bellatrix's flight."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several of the members of the Queen's guard and the captain continue strategizing, bent over the map as you met them.  The members of the Court gracefully make their way out, as well.  Daran stays behind to look over the battle plans.</p><p></p><p>Just outside the throne room, on the steps leading to upper chambers of the castle, Benna and Bellatrix sit, Bella's head in her sister's lap.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He stops on the spot, unsure whether he should continue; whether he should be so forward as to interrupt this private moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is weeping softly, but she's not hysterical anymore.  Benna is just lightly combing her hands through her sister's hair.  Her eyes are closed.   Mao is not quite sure this is a private moment, but it is a quiet one.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage stands there a moment longer before saying, "Forgive my intrusion, but I wanted to check on you Bella. I apologize if my actions were improper in any way. I did not intend to offend."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes stay closed, but she speaks in a soft, quivering voice.  "No, you did nothing wrong.  But, I couldn't...  I can't tell everyone in there..."  Her hand shoots out to hold Maouelue's.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue is surprised at this, but stands firm and grips her hand in return.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It is such a long story, how I came to be...  like I am.  But after feeling the surge of evil before, at the battle with the giants...  I... I..."  She chokes up, and sputters, trying to get words out.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will be as death to you if I go on this mission."  She looks Mao straight in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks back deeply, searching the pupils of her eyes, perhaps for the darkness deep within that she mentions.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't quite see into the depths, but there is darkness there.  And a faint light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I see. Then it shall be so. Please, take rest here in the care of the eladrin. Perhaps you will find more out more than we, if you find yourself up to the task. Keep your eyes and ears open and read deeply. Your knowledge and Benna’s wisdom may be more important than all the braun that has been put forward here. <i>I believe in you.</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The witch looks into the wizards eyes as well, both coming to some decision of their own.  Finally, she smiles and squeezes Mao's hand again, then lets go.  "We will learn as much as we can while we are here, right Benna?"  She turns to her sister, then back to Maouelue.  "Please be safe.  And come back to us.  To me."  She looks down for a moment, then shyly back up.  Her smile wavers.  Then, with arms linked, the sisters retreat up the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue watches their retreat back up the stairs until they are out of sight. He lingers a moment on the spot, Bella’s final words ringing in his head...</p><p></p><p><i>To me.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He swells a bit at this, then heads back to the war table to rejoin the discussion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[500 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue makes his way, heart oddly heavy and light at the same time, he meets Daran and the rest of the military group leaving the ready room.  "Hoy there, Maouelue.  We're headed off to the armory, see what we can check out there and what the deployments will need.  I could use a better bow, although this has been with me for many a year."  He smiles wistfully at the old wooden bow in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He nods stoically and joins the ranks, curious after all to see the royal armory.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several turns and twists later, the group comes within sight of a large golden door decorated with flourishes of weaponry.  Daran gets a goofy smile on his face as the doors glide open without a sound.  Inside, all manner of cabinetry and shelving holds golden weapons of war.  Brightly polished swords stand at attention, metal and wood bows cover a section of the wall.   All types of ammunition are in racks in the center of the room.  On a far was, more eccentric items are available.  Some eladrin are already here, outfitting themselves.  As the new group enters, an air of frivolity, and almost fraternity nature, comes out in the warrior.  All gear up for the coming battle.  (If you want, I can set up a list of what's available.  There are all basic weapons and ammunition as listed in the Player's Handbook.  For Fey-specific weaponry, we'll have to roll on a table.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a small table, there are a few items of interest Maouelue hasn't seen before.  A small wooden box labeled “Ekkio’s Bestiary”, a set of bracers with an etching depicting a centaur, a quartz crystal wound around with a single thread of starlight, and lastly, a gray velvet purse.  And up on the wall, in a place of honor, are two swords, crossed on an ornamental background.  One sword burns a red-orange-yellow shimmer, the other a blue-purple-white one.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen walks in, and all of the soldiers take a knee.  Including Daran.  She walks through to the section with the swords.  "These were forged long ago, back when my sister was simply the Winter Queen.  She was kind, sweet.  Not the cold-hearted person she is now.  These were never meant to fight against each other, they are best used together.  They can only be imparted to the champion of the Summer Queen.  Who shall rise to that title?  Present yourself before me, and I will see your destiny."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue kneels, "I am your champion, Queen Titania. It is my company's piercing of the veil that pushes these causes to the brink. In solemn service to the causes of justice I shall straddle the divide between worlds, between houses divided, between Summer and Winter, between Life and Death."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bids the wizard to approach and kneel at her feet.  (Does Maouelue comply?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He respectfully genuflects, down on one knee.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, shakes her arms out of her voluminous, sheer sleeves, and places her palms on Maouelue's temples.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A feeling like plunging in ice-water, naked, consumes the mage.  A feeling like all of his nerves have gone full tilt, and visions run through his head like stampeding animals running from a ravenous monster...</p><p><i>A tower, books, learning.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A field, walking through with Shi'Vandos, teaching.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A secret meeting, a secret brother, a secret family.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A search, a town, a friend, a small favor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A series of tunnels, swarms of rats.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>A return, triumphant, a meeting in the woods, an assassin, treachery.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The images spill on and on, until the moment they're in, then beyond, but the images get too fast to see, they blur together, they become as a pool of colored water, swirling, spinning...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As if pulled through an ice sheet, Maouelue opens his eyes and is back in the armory.  The Summer Queen rips her hands away and catches herself from falling on the table with the feywild oddities, knocking a few things on the floor.  Her face is contorted in a mixture of emotions.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"My Queen?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks confused, angry yet elated, and horror-stricken, all at the same time.  Maouelue's comany (and all of the other soldiers, for that matter) have never seen her anything more or less than placid.  This is an extreme reaction, and she's not really trying to hold anything back, either.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She's breathing heavy and says, "You?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks up into her eyes, not knowing, but intuiting the depths at which his presence, his heritage, the timing of his coming, could upset the balance here of all places. His curiosity forms as careworn crow's feet in the corners of his eyes, his spritely vigor letting down its illusion to show the meticulous, resourceful, yet confused child-grown. The thirst for the answer to all the riddles of his lineage now written in the lines on his face, begging for the answer.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Shi'Vandos is my father. I...did not know it until late; not long ago as a matter of fact did I learn of my history. I aim not to bring this old rift to your doorstep, and thus have focused on the matters at hand...but now, I see there is no avoiding it. Please...I am at your service...but I need to know...who I truly am."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She straightens, shakily.  One of her aides brings her a chair, just in time as she collapses as soon as she gets fully upright.  All manner of people are both around her for support, and avoiding the kneeling man on the floor, as if he were diseased and highly contagious.  The Queen whispers something to a soldier to her left, and he bolts away, without a second look back.  The atmosphere is tense... strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She takes another deep breath.  From a conflicted countenance, she begins.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There once was a noble family, they were not a part of the Court but they yearned to be.  There are both times and methods we have in place to admit such families into our fold.  Of which, this family took part and was eventually accepted as a full noble blood member of the Summer Court.  They hid, however, a dark secret, one which destroyed not only their standing within our hallowed halls, but created a rift so large they were all banished to other realms for eternity, never again being allowed to set foot in the Feywild.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yet, my husband, a kind and generous man, did not guarantee their banishment by completing the ritual that would keep them out.  He, in kindness, though that future generations might be able to make amends.  He banished only the culprits, but not the kin.  There is a saying that the children pay for the sins of their fathers.  In this case...  well... that may as yet be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Have you heard tell of the dragonmarks?  Or the prophecy of the Dragon, Maouelue?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I have seen and read many things relating to the dragons, but this point eludes me. Please, enlighten me." </p><p></p><p>He continues to kneel, head lowered in deference.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"And what do you know of other realms, planes?  Eberron?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Is this, truly, the only other plane you've visited besides your own?"  An anger starts rising in the Queen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Only whispers, allusions, references..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Answer me true, Maouelue the Dragon Mage, what do you intend to do after the victorious raid?  Take my throne?  Steal the Court?  Destroy the Feywild?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I ask for your trust, for demand it I cannot. As a royal, I know not whether you can understand the pain of being a pawn in your own life, though forgive my presumptuousness. My past, as my future, continue to reveal themselves to me in tandem...a dual helix of timelines traveling in reverse. The great circle traversed in both directions."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I seek above all to serve the causes of life."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He draws a sigil of Bahamut in the air, his triple-triumvirate now spinning around the platinum-blue ice trails hovering within.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I am called The Dragon Mage, though perhaps I do not know why. My kinship with the Lord of Dragons was at first a bit of fancy, a delusion of grandeur perhaps. Yet, he opened himself willingly to me and has been my guide ever since. </p><p></p><p>I pretend not to know of the depths of your ancient rifts and strife. I only know that my cause is just and I seek not to usurp, but to unify! Let no soul who would aid the causes of righteousness be turned away for ancient prejudice! Let us rally as one nation united across the realms to beat back the forces of Death and Darkness! Let the full spectrum of light, the infinite chroma, shine throughout all lands!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stands up slowly, looking down on the mage.  Not in anger now, but fear.  "Answer me this last question.  What is your surname?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I..."</p><p>"I know not."</p><p></p><p>Saying these words out loud trigger a desperate search in Maouelue's....Lumao's mind. His amnesia coming in fits and spurts...lost words...lost memories...he clings on to his old name in his mind, trying to piece it together....</p><p></p><p>...for naught.</p><p></p><p>The answer is not forthcoming....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He now rises up, turns around and begins rummaging through his things, digging relentlessly for something.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Tucked deep within the pages of his torn diary, he finds what he is looking for. An old note. An undelivered message. Unread out of honor and duty, but now...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>It would seem the truth would finally have to be out, though he is reluctant to reveal these personal tidings to all, there really is nothing left for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He proffers Shi'Vandos' mesage for Shi'Veilan to the Queen.</p><p></p><p>"These are the words of my Father, intended for his...other son. <i>Brightshine</i>... Of mine own name, I remain yet ignorant....uninformed...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It begins with Lumao...or at least that's what I can remember. Perhaps, Majesty, you might do me the honor of filling in the rest...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He genuflects again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The soldier comes in with a book, and the Queen takes it from him, sets it on the table.  She puts a hand out in front of the kneeling man, says elven works.  A warmth spreads over the mage, quite the opposite feeling of her previous magics.  After a few moments, she lifts the mage up to standing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the room at large, she says, "Continue to prepare.  I will be back shortly." </p><p>Then she says to Maouelue, "Follow me.  There is something you need to know, friend of elves and dragons."  She is smiling now, quietly, softly.  She walks to a side room where a table and several bookshelves line the wall.  She's brought the book the soldier gave her, and she sits at the table, offering Maouelue the other lone chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Queen Titania opens the book, flipping through until she stops at a page.  She turns the book to face the wizard.  "Do you recognize this symbol?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your surname is Albrek.  Shi'Vandos was a high mage that came to the Feywild well after his family was banished, one of the high hopes of Oberon."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"These dragonmarks...  they are aberrations in the fabric of reality, Maouelue.  Some say they are a birthright, given at specific times after specific deeds are done.  Other say they spontaneously occur, being as brands on the skin.  I will ask you, although you can decline showing me...  Is this mark anywhere on your body currently?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Astonishingly, the mage realizes he cannot answer this question in full knowledge of the truth. Something about her way and line of questioning seems to drive right at the heart of his uncertainties, almost in a knowing, motherly sort of way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If it would not offend the Queen..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He makes to disrobe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let us find out together."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He begins to doff his armor, laying the pieces out ritually as he does, akin to back in Oakhurst. As the metal peels away, he feels the warm sweaty undergarments articulated by the open air, chilling slightly. Piece after piece he bares himself fully to Titania.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he is taking his clothing off, just before he gets to the...  erm...  personal bits, he remembers something in speaking with his father.  Something of the trials.  Something about a birthright...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...<i>the circled key</i>...”</p><p></p><p>The words leave his mouth as if spoken by another, his form entranced in this astounding, yet serene, scene.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Queen pulls back a bit, visibly.  "So, you're aware of this?  It does not look like it's on you at this moment..."  She leaves the silence to speak the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the ice in the mountain...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the Frozen Tears...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...the Prince...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao Albrek rises and turns now to face his Queen, the last remnants of his coverings both outer and now inner have been removed. </p><p></p><p>“I stand before you in the naked truth of the ancient starlight. I have nothing left to hide, and though there is much to be feared, I put my faith in that light.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“My Queen, I Lumao Albrek do formally request that I may undertake the Trials of the Eldar, to prove my honor and claim my birthright!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks completely taken aback by the statement.  "You...  you know what that means, yes?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I must admit, much as everything in my life, I seem to know but only enough to be pushed unrelenting to my fate. My ears are open, as are my heart and soul. Whatever the risks, they are mine alone to bear. For now I listen.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at Maouelue, earnestly.  "This book has in it a dire warning of those marks.  I would hinder you not from going on your quest, taking the trials.  But Maouelue, please know what you are asking both of me and of this kingdom.  Anyone who bears that mark is not allowed in the Feywild upon punishment of death.  The great laws demand it so.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It goes back to the last statement of your ancestor, as they were banished from this land.  A destiny was put upon any with the mark.  They are to be the ruin of the eladrin. </p><p> They are to be the bringer of balefire down upon the planes.  They will be as a plague upon the free peoples of the world.  And they are to search out and find the core of the Dragon Prophecy and begin the calamity.  If you continue on your path, this <i>will be</i> your destiny.  I fear not only for your life, Wizard.  I fear for your soul."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The ancestor of Albrek does not move, does not make a sound. He stoops still, stoically staring into not the space in front of him. In and out of focus, time turns elastic. He feels a deep roar swelling from his core, like a supernova of emotion teeming to the brink, then finally eventing, piercing the precipice of pressure, the crest of the wave, the horn of the dragon sounding out its woe of tidings. The ferocious din gathering inside wells up through his voice and now the Dragon Mage rises up off the ground, raising his taut face to the sky, baring his chest upwards, then...</p><p></p><p>"rrrrrRRRrRrRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAAAaaAAAaAaAaAggGGHGG!!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>In a flash, all of the pent up emotion, the years of towing the line, treading the path cut before him with lies, deceit, and ulterior motive, lashes out in a zealous fury! As Bahamut spares not the life before him that is without redemption, so forth does this uproarious ebullition, woefully warbled by the weary and worn wizard, spare not the sanctity and serenity of this place. It bears no heed for the Queen's prophetic words. Pure release, that born of the same energies that push all causes forth, those that continue to push boundaries of polarity only to be resisted inevitably by the grand wheel, the great equal, the inevitable return. From here and always, the recapitulation is always nigh.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the roar issues forth from the mage, the centerpiece of a cosmic game of tug-of-war, a wild surge of magic issues forth.  Soldiers come in, Daran as well, and see chaos.  Maouelue is floating in the middle of the room, cloaked in a sphere of silvery, wispy light.  Queen Titania, and all of the other objects in the room, are tossed about, then are reatracted to the ceiling in a sudden reversal of gravity.  Everything lands with a <i>thump</i>, and even a couple soldiers, the first ones to the Queen's aid, go shooting  upwards.  Daran tries to yell out for Maouelue's attention...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He dare not enter the room, but he yells from the doorway, keeping everyone out at same time.  "Maouelue!  What are you doing?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A glowing eye turns to Daran, but there is little recognition there, this is something from deep within the mage that seems to have overridden his conscience.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A mage from the other room tries to think quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The spell pulses through the floating mage, dimming, but not extinguishing the burst of light. Lumao falls to the floor, slamming down hard, unconscious.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blackness overtakes Maouelue.  Dread dreams of darkness, where dragons dwell.  The snatches of images are brief, but what Maouelue will remember is the fear and uncertainty all around him.</p><p></p><p>He wakes in a comfortable bed, the setting sunlight streaming through the open windows.  It's a simple room, simple wooden bed.  The room is small and quaintly adorned.  Bellatrix sits next to the wizard, ringing out a cloth and is about to put it to his head when she notices he's awake.  She freezes, watching with wide eyes.  Waiting.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He blinks a few times, then raises his arm to shield the piercing sunlight. His vision begins to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"...Bella?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What...what happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stammers, mouth opening and closing.  Then she closes her mouth and throws herself at Maouelue, hugging him and crying softly.  "Oh, Mao.  I'm so sorry.  You must have been so scared.  It's...  It's...  Oh Mao, it's all my fault."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He is slow to react at first, surprised at her thrown embrace, then he wraps his arms around her, holding her close. Closing his eyes again, he says, "How? How could this be <i>your</i> fault? What happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I let the darkness out.  It is my fault.  You...  you and the Queen, you went to a side room.  The others said she did some sort of reading and that you and she had severe words.  She was concerned about your heritage and whether you had designs on her kingdom.  Madness, all of it.  And all of it laid at my feet.  You both had recessed in the side room, and then an explosion happened.  We heard it from the second floor, across the castle.  Daran said he saw you hovering off the ground and that gravity reversed itself.  The Queen was unconscious and the room was in turmoil.   Naturally, Daran tried to help.  He said you would never, but some guards and soldiers carried Titania away, and the rest escorted us out of the castle.  </p><p></p><p>"We're at an inn at the outskirts of the city.  Just outside of the Eastern docks.  They said we can have passage away from Astrazalian.  They said we can travel in the other lands, but are long longer welcomed by the Court.  Oh, I'm so sorry, Maouelue."  She cowers again against the wizard's chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The gravity of these words falls over the elf like an icy sheet. He shudders for a moment, but otherwise remains motionless, thinking. <i>Surely this can't have been all Bella's doing.</i> His zeal had gotten the better of him yet again, but it would not end here. No way. There were still too many questions left unanswered. <i>The Queen...</i> Once again, memory is a fit of haze. <i>What happened?!?</i> He would have to set this right. Soon. Now. There would be no future chance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's a soft knock on the closed door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We leave for Mag Tureah tonight."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He pulls himself from Bella's embrace and goes to answer the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Who goes there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Otirnis, lord wizard.  Bearing a parting gift from the Queen and Court."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao opens the door, a tear frozen in the corner of his eye. "Otirnis, it is good of you to come. You are welcome here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows, hand to shoulder.  Then straightens and presents the book from the side room to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Queen sends her regrets that she is not able to deliver this in person.  She wishes you and your party well.   And she said to tell you, if you decide the opposite road of that which you have discussed before, she would be open to speaking again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Otirnis," he places his hand on his heart. "I will speak with the Queen."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin nods, salutes again, and says, "Very well.  Follow me."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao looks back at Bella, “Let us ready ourselves for the journey ahead. We will meet again with the Queen.” He turns back to Otirnis, “If it please her majesty, I would have us <i>all</i> attend.” He glances meaningfully at Bella, then assembled his things and begins to don his armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis adds, "I will wait by the front doors.  At your leisure, lord wizard."  Carrying her things already, Bellatrix helps Maouelue with his armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After a customary final sweep of the premises, the two leave through the front door to join their eldarin guard. “I am sorry to bring such trouble to your realm, Otirnis. Would that we could have met under different circumstances.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Otirnis gives Maouelue a long glance, not showing any inner thought or prejudice.  Just a review of the man she sees before her.  "You are special, Maouelue.  You and your group.  Far be it for me to hold your presence or circumstances against you.  In fact, the way I see it, if you hadn't appeared when you did, we might not have made it back to Aztrazalian at all.  There were too many to face for our group, between the fomorians and the goblin horde.  There is no need for sorrow or grief towards me or my unit, lord wizard.  We stand behind you.  And will continue to fight by your side, should you still find it fitting."  She hops on a horse tethered to the post outside the inn, offers the other four to the party and says, "Follow me, please."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She then heels her horse W towards the center of the island.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group moves quickly through the somewhat empty streets.  Giving a wide berth to the horse riders, the elves and eladrin gawk at the procession.  Through the town, through the crystal gates, then into the courtyard proper, everyone is relieved of their mounts and walked into the palace.  Maouelue notices there are several guards escorting them now, where as before it was quite a bit lighter coverage.  Bellatrix stands besides the wizard, offering her support in proximity.  Daran and the old woman take up  the rear, Benna now quiet with no hint at mirth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The escort brings them to the throne room where, as before, the three chairs are filled by their liege lords.  The Queen looks outwardly calm, but sits straighter in her chair as she sees the procession brought forward.  King Oberon looks concerned, while Queen Tiandra has a look of puzzlement on her face.  She says, "What are they doing back here, guards?  I thought the Court made it clear that they were no longer welcome here."</p><p></p><p>"Be at peace, sister.  The guards were instructed to bring them if there was a parlay to be had.  I assume that is why you are here again, goodsir Mage?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I must admit, I was surprised to be offered a second chance after my previous...outburst. I know not what overcame me, but i ask not for forgiveness, only the opportunity to repent. For this chance, I am most grateful. There is much confusion in my heart, but my mind is set firmly on aiding your cause and rescuing my friend. </p><p></p><p>These past days I have let my ego grow wild to the detriment of others. No longer shall this be the case. I take the knee once more.”</p><p></p><p>Lumao genuflects again, this time with no sense of grandeur.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The others follow suit, mimicking their leader.  </p><p>"Please, rise, sir Mage.  What is done is done, and what was said," she gives Maouelue a knowing stare, "was said.  Take to heart what you can accept, leave the rest as you will.  It is my understanding, since you are here, that you all still wish to still take part in ridding our lands of the scourge of the Queen of Air and Darkness's forces of evil?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It is thus, Majesty.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at all of the group in turn.  (Insight check, with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She's holding something back, but what it is, you're not sure.  Maybe her next statement...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She seems to come to a decision.  "There has been a new development.  There is a need for a small, rogue group to infiltrate the my dark sister's lair itself."  The King and Queen turn to look at her, confused.  "The dark crystal that has tormented her thus would be the objective.  She carries it with her at all times.  And she is surrounded by guards and all other manner of unseelie fiends.  This is not something I ask lightly, obviously.  However, it would mean the end to whatever has a hold on her.  It would also go a long way to proving your worth to the Court.  If this does not sound amenable to you our your party, the raid is still an option."  She sits placidly while waiting for a response.  As for the other seelie in the room, every mouth is agape.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It shall be done.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 3 iterations, DC 20...</p><p>1d20 (14) + 2 = </p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (7) + 2 = </p><p>0 successes, 28 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna starts giggling under her breath again.  Daran sighs.  Bellatrix takes a sharp intake of breath.  But no one says anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Very well.  You will meet with Captain Jelentrianna in the armory in four hours time.  She will go over the objectives.  Bring me back the black crystal and my sister, both preferably unharmed.  Anything else is ancillary and up to your discretion.  If you wish, we can give you an out if you are caught and do not wish to be tortured.  The Captain will see to your needs and the plans.  Good luck and may the gods bless you all, warriors of Astrazalian."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao bows silently and follows to the armory.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage and company follow a guard escort to the armory, where the doors are opened and are ushered inside.  There is a side table with four chairs, and Daran immediately draws one out and sits.  When the guards leave the room to take their posts outside the door, the ranger says, "Whats the play here, Maouelue?  We really going to do this?"</p></div>
