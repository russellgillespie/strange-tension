<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-1"><p>The first thing Dieter does is try to use his powers to turn into an animal.  He focuses...  and it's strange. Normally he can feel the warp and weave of the natural magic around him.  Now, he just feels the cold emptiness of dank, damp air.  He shivers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Shit. Shit shit shit! What am I going to do. Where the hell is Maouelue?... Shit. What a mess back there. And the henchmen! Uuuuugh. The hallucination, the battle, now this? Dear me...no magic...what is this foul darkness. After so long underground, a breath of light and air and trees....but now this. Sigh. Time to get down to it Dieter. We've got to figure a way out of this mess. Yes. Yes we do.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter quickly shuts his eyes, but leaves one half cracked open. He lies there trying to get his bearings without being noticed awake.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i> <i>Ssccchick</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter blinks several times as his vision comes to. He takes in the carving main's appearance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume stares back at you, whittling but not watching what he is doing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A pall permeates Dieter's face. His core seems to turn to an anvil. There's no avoiding this now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So we meet again."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Was wondering when you'd be waking, laddie.  Howse the body?  Anything broken?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Does <i>spirit</i> count?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He frowns, shrugs, thinks.  "No.  I suppose you thought you'd win that fight.  Hells be true, I thought you would as well.  Came through everything else.  Was hoping to have this conversation with the both of you boys, too, but here we are.  Don't think of it as a knock on your talents, lad.  That magus friend of yourn is...  he's a wily one!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume stops carving, stands and stows the knife and wood.  He squats on his haunches next to you, like he's ready for a quiet conversation.   He motions to the shackles.  "May I?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks at him cautiously, questioningly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Just what is your role in all this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "At the moment?  Just trying to get these off'n ye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter nods in assent</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man smiles, reaches into his mouth, scratching the inside of his cheek with a thumb.  He pulls out a small jagged metal bit, and proceeds to unlock Dieter's bonds.  Once they're off, he sets them quietly on the floor, with a finger pressed against his lips in a, <i>Shhh</i> motion.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The continuously re-bewildered druid sets his bare feet down silently on the cold hard ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So, when you boys didn't come quietly, the boss...  he didn't like that very much.  Sent me to keep old Culver company here.  He's been unconscious for awhile now, nothing I can do to wake him.  Funny thing about these old places," he steps to a dark corner of the cell.  He studies it a moment, then kicks out with a dirty boot.  A small section of the wall moves in, a flicker of light can be seen below.  "Secrets abound."  He smiles again at you. </p><p></p><p>"Here's the thing.  There's going to be a guard coming down the way in a few.  They check up on us, but not always consistently.  My guess, if we wait for the next pass, then leave right after, we should get a good head start, eh?"</p><p></p><p>"Plus...  leaves us time to catch up."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye. But...how do I know I can trust you? You say 'The Boss' like a joiner. Pardon my wariness, but...as you can imagine..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"...my instinct to trust is a bit...riven."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"To be expected, to be expected for sure.  And you can't trust me.  Shouldn't trust me, I should say.  I don't work at causes, but I 'join' where the money is.  Or power.  Truthfully," he leans in, "I'm in it for the loot, lad!  I'd rather rob a thousand houses, crawl through a million forgotten dungeons, if I can find a lost artifact or ancient text.  Not that I can use any of that shite.  But they do fetch a pretty sum, to the right buyers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"In an effort to be a bit more trustworthy, I should say <i>that's</i> the real reason I was down in those caves.  I'd been looking for that tomb for some time, now.  Got what we could, but I didn't find all of what the boss was after.  He's pissed about that, too.  Oh well.   What are ye gonna do, am I right?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Mercenaries...<i>Fight for a cause, but don't die for it...</i> That's how the saying goes, right?," He considers a moment. "Well, I'm no stranger to a bit of loot lust either, but I won't forsake my companions." His eyes turn to Culver. "We must do something about him. What's his part in all this. That's where it all started for Maouelue and me. I would see our rescue completed if such a cause be just."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks over at the lump on the bed.  He sucks his teeth, considering.  "The old man has taken a beating, that's for sure.  But don't you worry yourself about it, he wasn't taken on your account.  Word around the water barrel is that he owed the boss some money, decided to renege on his side of the bargain.  Him meeting you boys was incidental at best.  The boss decided to use his disappearance to lure you both, that's about all.  He'll come around soon, hopefully.  You good with leaving him here if we have to?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter agonizes over this a moment. "I suppose we've gotten in enough trouble on his account already. Aye, we'll leave him if needs be. But, it sounds like this Boss has a comeuppance in his future...I'll make sure of that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shrugs and sits back down on his dingy cot.  The mildew smell is quite strong and he coughs, spits into an empty corner of the room.  "So, did you find out more about that bastard Muhlen?  Any more tricks up his sleeve in that goblin infested hovel he called a vault?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"More than a few tricks indeed. I'm not sure if we found more of his after you...did you run or were you taken?...I suppose it matters little at this point. We forged a bit of our own fortune down there, then sought sanctuary above. Only to find...well, I guess you know that part now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I have a question though...what in the bloody hells happened to my power down here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, right.  To be true, I was...  recalled.  Had to leave you boys, didn't want to, but when you're compelled...  Nothing much you can do, eh?  As for the magics down here.  We're in some sort of prison complex.  It's pretty vast, but it has a lot of secrets, as I showed you there."  Points at the exit.  "Well, it seems that this prison was set up for spell casters and magic users of all types.  My guess, we're in an anti-magic shell.  Or maybe there's a mythallar somewhere around, but you best pray that's not the case!  We'll all get blown to smithereens if that thing goes wonky!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You say <i>recalled</i>...<i>compelled</i>...By what means? I'd rather not fall into any unavoidable traps on account of...whatever mechanism that is if you take my meaning."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He scratches his stubble.  "Let's just say...  the boss keeps a close grasp on what's dearest to me.  Sometimes I find it hard to say no, if you catch my drift.  He's a magic user, he can speak to me whenever he wants.  So, yeah, anyone with me would be at danger from him scrying or spying or whatever the Hells he does.  We can split this place and then part ways, if you're happier with that.  I just thought...  well.  I thought I at least owed you a conversation before I took off, if that makes sense.  No honor among thieves, as it were, but...  just seemed the right thing to do.  You and your mage friend are good people.  Owed you as much."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Understood. I suppose we'll cross that chasm when we come to it. Let's keep an ear for the guard and get ready to make our escape."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye." His look bores into Dieter, trying to gain some insight into his bearing.  After a few moments, he says, "One last thing.  Did you happen to find anything about a red crystal, 'bout yea big?"  He holds up his fist.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Can’t recall seeing anything like that...Mind’s a bit hazy though, i suppose.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Now?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume gets up, waits at the barred window for a beat.  "Can't hear or see 'em, let's go."  He heads to the corner, pushes the moveable wall, and, little by little, an opening appears.  Torchlight flickers on a wooden ladder leaning against a wall.  Looking down the opening, it's only about an eight foot drop.  Frume offers for Dieter to go first.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Sure, what the hell."</p><p>He squeezes in and slides down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a rather tight fit, and when Dieter gets to the bottom, the tunnel that stretches before him is only five feet tall.  They'll both have to hunch while they're walking.   A lit torch is illuminating the hall as well as a intersection opening to the left and right 10-15 feet ahead.  (Roll20 is live!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The dilapidated Druid moves to and peeks around the corners.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another hallway.  Going left there's an opening to t he right, opposite on the right side.  The hall looks like it was carved hurriedly with shoddy tools; there are gashes and marks on the walls like blade cuts.  The floor is loose, dried clay.  Walking normally, Dieter and Frume slip on the scree and are probably going to be fighting with their footing all the way through.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They slyly slink...left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another long hallway ending in what looks like a mold-infested wall.  Two openings are on the left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is also getting dim down the hallways, now.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of light farther in the tunnels.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to move back and take the torch from the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torch comes off easily, and you sense that it is magically lit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Sensing the magic in the torch, Dieter looks for any loose pebbles on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter spies a few pebbles which would work well with his plans. (😁)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He...tries his stony cantrip.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A crackling comes from the druid's hands.  (Give me an arcana check, then a dex save.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The magic goes through, but not without consequences.  A sharp pain slices through Dieter's mind, sending him to his knees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aaaaaghh! What the...?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rubs his temples, each of which just felt a short sharp shock. “Well, these will come in handy at least. Might need to wait a bit longer before trying that again. And surely I shouldn’t go all firestarter anytime soon.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We need to get us some weaponry.  Who knows what's down here.  I've heard some strange stories."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Do you know where they took our things?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, back at the head of that hall.  We might be able to find a way up, but it might be better to beg off that stuff.  You have anything you can't part with in your pack?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“...a great. many. things.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“But let us not needlessly throw ourselves into the lions den. I’ll search with you down here for some means to recover what was stolen.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  Lets make our way...  west.  Should be that way, might be able to find a way up.  Still think the best way out is through these catacombs."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Frume. Let us continue on cautiously. Stand back and if I am apprehended, you flee.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pushes up to the next corner and peeks around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Like hell I will.  No one gets outta here alive on their own.  Least that's what I heard.  Nothing down here we can't handle, right?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Right. Let’s do this.” Dieter stops himself a moment. “You think there’s equipment in the catacombs?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think there might be.  Could be rusted all to shite, but it'll be better than anything we got at the moment."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the pair peer left, they see a wall at the end of a very short hall.  (Perception check, please!  Also, afk for kiddos bedtimes.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter senses that there's something off about the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks for a non-magical stone to throw at it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter tosses a rock at the wall...  and it passes through.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sheeeiiiiiit. Let’s go!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You might be too excited about this, let me head in first.  If there is someone over there, they might recognize me."  He pushes by and steps through the barrier.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Now what is this guy up to?...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume picks his head back through. </p><p>"You're...  You're gonna wanna see this.  Put something over your nose, first, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter finds two lesser pebbles with which to snuff his snout, then follows Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What in the buddy Bahamut is this!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You walk into a nightmare.  Bloody implements are hanging on the wall and strewn about tables.  Blood is staining the walls and floor, some dried, some still very wet.  A trail is coming from a wooden door in the N wall.  On the table against the W wall, a dissected body is displayed.  Parts of the man's body and sections of skin have been completely removed.  (Perception check or Investigation if you want something specific.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter walks over to the body and tries to remember the rituals depicted in the vault. Was this akin to any of them? Was there a pattern to this...vivisection? <i>And just what kind of implements do we have here?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume...do you know about any of this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I knew they were doing experiments down here, but I just thought it was of the arcane persuasion.  Trying to break the anti-magic barrier, that sort of thing.  This..."  He looks like he's going to be sick.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks over the body.  It does look familiar to what you've seen before in the vault, more depraved though.  Not a specific pattern that he can tell.  There are all sorts of torture, butchering, and slicing equipment.  If you wanted to grab something as a weapon, you'll have a selection to choose from.  (Investigation check for weaponry.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find 3 rusted daggers, caked in blood.  You also find one <i>very</i> sharp sickle.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Guess these'll have to do." He takes a sickle and a dagger and hands the other two to Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Been a while since I used one of these, but...it's just like riding a dolphin."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume also finds a rusted dagger and a makeshift club.</p><p>"Thank ye, friend.  Ne'er had a chance to ride a dolphin.  Gods willing, I'll be able to try when I get back to the sea!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah the sea...Someday Frume. And I haven't forgotten about our promise either..." He looks meaningfully at the crippled man and then blushes at handing him two daggers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well anyway...you can throw them too...Never can have...enough...daggers."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You notice as you hand him the daggers...   his has both of his hands.</p><p>"Aye, true!"  He flips the two with both hands, then pockets them.  He's got the dagger in his left hand, the club in his right.  "To the door, then?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter blinks in amazement. "Well...I guess...now I know why I forgot! What in the nine– How?!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"How, what?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your–Your handS!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Updated and saved data for The Frumious Bandersnatch!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shakes his head once more in amazement and begins to head north toward the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, the hand, yeah!  Had a good healer in camp.  And someone willing to lend me a...  hand!  Eh?  Eh?  All right, lets go through the door.  You checking it for traps, or should I?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter smirks. It almost reminds him of joking around with Maouelue. </p><p>"Why don't you take a look. You'll know these folks' habits better than I."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Looks fine, here goes."  He pushes the door open...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...for Flipper's sake!...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A javelin emerges from the floor and spears the thief in the foot.  He hops through the door, slips on more blood on the floor, and falls prone.  In front of a pile of dead bodies, all in various states of decay.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are two alternative exits to this room, wooden doors the same as the one Frume just went through.  Both are closed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You ok?”, Dieter asks as he gingerly steps over the trap and peers around the room, instinctively turning left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sure, I'll be okay.  What the fuck is this?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’m glad Maouelue isn’t here to see this...”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are many species and types of bodies in the pile.  As Dieter takes a closer look, he realizes that these bodies are missing skin and other parts as well.  There is a table in the far NW corner of the room.  Things are growing from several dishes and bowls.  The smell is awful; gag-inducing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter reluctantly takes a closer look at the table, holding his breath best he can.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>At another time, Dieter would normally have spent hours pouring over the contents of this table.  It looks like experiments are being done with bodily fluids and different funguses and molds.  (Insight or Investigation for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Whomever put this together was trying to grow certain foods and cultures from mixing bodily fluids with blood and water.  A couple are doing okay, but the rest have gone into putrescence.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leaves the abominable table and heads to the south door checking it for traps.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When Dieter approaches the door, a sparkle of blue-green catches his eye.  There is a gem in the middle of the door, catching the light of their torch at odd angles.  Dieter can also sense Frume picking over the bodies, searching them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's tough to pinpoint, but you know it has something to do with conjuration magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume, have you seen anything like this from the Runemark before?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No.  No idea what that is.  Want me to try to pick it out?"  He waggles a dagger.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm... let's test it out first before you lose that hand again. Dieter goes to grab a bit of something from the pile and throws it at the mark."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>That really hits Frume's funny bone and he starts giggling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter grabs a spare foot, it <i>pops</i> off with a <i>squelch</i>.  He tosses the foot at the door.  It hits the gem.  A gross splotch is left on the gem and the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm...well I didn't really expect that to work." Dieter takes a Magic Stone and throws it at the gem.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone hits the gem and vanishes.  You hear a <i>clack</i> coming from the room you just came from.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume, can you see what that was?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He heads back, brings Dieter his stone seconds later.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How strange. Here, go watch again while I throw."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The pair make to do just that.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone hits the gem square on, it disappears.  The <i>clack</i> comes from the other room again. </p><p>"Shite, it just appeared out of nowhere!  That's amazing!"  He brings Dieter back his stone again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok one more time. Stand back and see where it comes from."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This time Dieter slightly inserts his dagger.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger slides off the gem to the edge where it meets the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, bewildered, tries at the handle to open the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You disappear and reappear in the middle of the butcher room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"..."  Frume stares at you, eyebrows raised.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well would you look at that! Maybe do try and pull that gem Frume. We could use something like that surely, if it will come out that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"On it!"  Frume sticks the dagger in the edge and pries.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah.  This is sticking more than I thought.  You wanna give it a go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Sure thing. Let's see how sharp this sickle is. Maybe if we each take a side..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The two each take a blade and begin worrying away at the facets.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume kicks the door in frustration.  He disappears and reappears in the butcher room.  Dieter hears a muffled, "Fuck!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah the hell with it. Let's just move on." They head North, it being the leftmost remaining route.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens with a squeak and squeal.  The musty room is filled with sacks, crates, and a few small barrels.  One is leaking in the back of the room, a puddle pooling beneath it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They two give the provisions(?) a once-over.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Most of the bags are beans or grains, their freshness is in question.  Plus, all of the foodstuffs in here have been around the ill-smelling table maybe too long.  Dieter finds some jerky that might be okay.  Just as he turns to give some to Frume, he hears a skittering from the ceiling...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>28</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>SW1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (9) + 1 = <code>10</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah shite, with these things!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As they drop from the ceiling, Frume tries swatting them from his face while Dieter slices with the sickle.  The group come up from everywhere, skittering on the walls and all over the two men.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spiders start biting Frume, making him yell in frustration and pain.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>You do not have permission to view this combatant's attacks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are relentlessly biting at the two heroes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume wipes the last few spiders away from himself and Dieter, and with a deft swipe of his dagger and stamp of his boot, the swarm is no more.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What's the chance that's the worst living thing we see down here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[100 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Heh...I’ll not answer that rhetorical for fear of jinxing it.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks the far wall of the corridor for any more shenanigans.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't tell if there are any more shenanigans or not.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gives it up and head back south to the other hallway.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now just what do we have here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter moves from the pantry and through the rooms to one of the main halls, Frume follows, giving a longing look at the gem-door.  Dieter moves to the end of the hall.  There the hall turns left, ending ten feet away with a door on the N end.  Several holes are cut into the clay wall.  Inset in the holes are several skulls, lit candles in the center.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Before the left turn, the N wall is covered with green mold, almost like algae.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume comes over to help. He places a dagger at where he believes the hinges to be, working the corner while Dieter tries again.  (Another, with advantage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Thanks Frume.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger slips, the door creaks a bit.  But it remains shut.  "For the love of all that's holy, why are the doors down here impossible to get through?  It's almost like they don't want anything moving around down here, eh?"  He gives Dieter a dark look.</p><p>"Fuck it, lets try this."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door hits a low note, <i>bong</i>, but does not yield.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Worth a shot, I guess.  Looks like there's a door at the end of the hall."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm... Maybe we’ll find a means of opening it elsewhere.”</p><p>Dieter inspects the door for a locking mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is feeling exceptionally mediocre today.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two look over the door.  Is doesn't have a keyhole, however there is a gem inset in the center.  This one is a dull brown.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How’s that loot lust of your doing there eh Frume? Wanna give this one a go together?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, always a lustful man, Dieter, don't ever think otherwise!  We breaking down the door or trying to remove the gem?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The gem friend. The gem.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gem <i>pop</i> comes out in Dieter's hand.  The door <i>creaks</i> open.  The light shines on an unadorned room.  Rough clay all over, but there are a few piles of dust or ash on the ground.  In the middle of the room stands a stone column.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gem is imbued heavily with conjuration magic.  When inset into a wooden object like a door or a chest, it acts as a magical lock of sorts.  When the person trying to unlock fails their check, the wooden object grows a mouth with sharp teeth and attacks said person.  To set it into a wooden object takes an arcana check DC 13, with subsequent tries going up by DC 1.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I suppose we should inspect this here pedestal, eh?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter beckons Frume over to the stone structure. He kneels down and looks around it’s base and searches for any markings that might betray its secrets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume enter the cubic room, the torchlight illuminating further in.  There is a wooden door at the E end of the N wall.  The dust doesn't stir much as they walk about.  The column is made of stone, not clay.  All four sides have fine ornamentation on them, intricate writing seems to scroll within the ornamentation.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I have a keen sense that I’m being really obtuse about this obelisk.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has never seen anything quite like this, nor has Frume.  You both get the feeling, looking over the script, that not many alive have ever seen anything like this, either.  As you pour over the intricate tracing, Frume pokes Dieter on the shoulder and says, "Look at that!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>You can kiss me, but never on my cheek</i></p><p><i>You can see me face to face, but never shall we meet</i></p><p><i>We look alike, but not the same</i></p><p><i>When I go away, it is not I to blame</i></p><p><i>In water, glass, or steel, we can touch but never feel</i></p><p><i>We were born on the same day; all the same habits, act the same way</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You are my reflection.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On the closest side towards Dieter, the stone turns to liquid, then resolves to a mirror sheen.  First, Dieter can see his own reflection.  Then, the image shimmers and a woman is standing there.  She is human, average height, into her later years.   Her graying brunette hair is held back by a kerchief, and the clothes she wears are vibrant and heavily patterned.  She smiles.  Then a kindly voice enters your head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You may ask me any one question."  She waits expectantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“How is my destiny intertwined with these dark serpents, a shadow of the light cast by my miraculous companion?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman cocks her head.  Her eyes sparkle in the torchlight, which seems to not only illuminate the room you're in, but hers as well.  "There are many roads you may travel, however each will lead you to your dark serpents.  The World Devourer waits for you and your companions.  The shadows are not the opposite to Bahamut's Chosen, but an aspect of the Great Dragon's duality, Tiamat.  While the races of elves stem from the various gods, all serpent races, including the Ancients, stem from the Great World Serpent.  At this time, there are those who are trying to open a rift in the material plane for the Great World Serpent.  Yet, there are those who are twisting their minds in order to bring Bahamut's nemesis to Faerun.  If this happens, all may be lost."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles kindly at you.  "Do not lose hope, dear Druid.  You may not have the strength now.  Follow your heart and trust in your friends.  The road will lead you to where you need to go.  Be sure you're learning to be ready for the battle when the time comes."  Smiling, she fades into Dieter's reflection.  Then the stone façade returns to the surface, and the words disappear.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stares transfixed at the spot where his oracle has just disappeared, his mind transfixed on what he has just heard. He stares, motionless, ruminating, stoic.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What happened there?  You see something I'm missing?"  Frume in going all over the column, unable to understand why Dieter's been staring at it intently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s attention is wrested from the column by Frume’s voice. </p><p>“Whoowha???”</p><p>“Oh! Frume. Ahhh, yes um. There was a...sort of vision? I can’t explain. Anyway, it won’t do to dally here. Onward my good man.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That's okay, that's just fine.  Didn't want you completely disappearing on me.  Hey, whatdya say we go try that blue gem again?  If we need to get your gear, we're kinda going the wrong way."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I suppose it can't hurt, now we've figured out how to pry them out. Let's do it!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads back to the gemmed door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok, together this time, right?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh! This fucking thing! Frume, I don't know if it's going to budge..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume gets an crazy look in his eye.  He looks to the door.  Then to the noxious table.  Then back to the door.  He gets down on his hands and knees, checking the bottom of the door.  He says, "Wanna try something?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I can see you're not going to let this go easily. Aye, I'll follow your lead."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Standing and heading toward the pile of bodies.  He tears some strips of cloth and brings them to the table, ushering Dieter over.  "If this doesn't work, or it takes too long, we'll search more."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume starts lighting the strips of cloth and tossing them into the various liquids and such on the table.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 10 iterations, DC 15...</p><p>1d20 (4) = </p><p>1d20 (3) = </p><p>1d20 (5) = </p><p>1d20 (</p><p>1d20 (10) = </p><p>1d20 (13) = </p><p>1d20 (18) = </p><p>1d20 (9) = </p><p>1d20 (2) = </p><p>1d20 (</p><p>2 successes, 85 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first few, nothing happens.   On the fourth, a small explosion lights up the table and the smell of ozone fills the air.  Frume smiles at Dieter.  "That's a winner!  Remember that one."  He continues.  Another does something similar.  Unfortunately, his enthusiasm reaches a bit too far.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He reaches a small red vial, the contents are thick and it looks almost like a solid mass instead of a liquid.  Frume drops the flaming bit of cloth into it.  Nothing happens for a second, two... three.   Then, the inside of the vial turns a bright orange, the vial balloons out...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The the contents implode.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume takes the brunt of it, while Dieter is able to jump behind the pile of bodies.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Oufffe! Also remember to <i>NOT</i> do that one again!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite!  Well.  No pain, no gain, right boyo!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, I'm no stranger to that one."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Just what did you put in that first one?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He is able to find the first beaker of putrescence and he sets it under the door.  "Just set it on fire, laddie!  I remember from some of my sailing days, we found some dead bodies on a beach.  Tried to burn them and several of them just <i>exploded</i>.  Figured there might be something here like that here.  If you would do the honors, let's stand back and toss the flame over!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Right."</p><p>Dieter tosses the torch then ducks behind the pile.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vial goes up in a fiery explosion, the door goes up in flames immediately.  Smoke fills the room.  (Con save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter starts coughing, hard.  Frume pushes something into his hand.  He pulls up a kerchief and motions for you to do the same.  (Con save again, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(<i>muffled</i>) "You good to go?  Let's get it!"  Frume runs at the flaming door.  He hits the door with his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter follows, with a shake of the head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door comes down and Frume pats down his clothes, checking for fire.  "Fun, right?!"  He smiles widely at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall is short and it turns sharply to the right.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You know what?!? That <i>was</i> fucking fun!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter likes this bit of reckless indifference. It's an interesting change of pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ha!"  He thumps you on the shoulder, then heads to the break in the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The subsequent hallway goes north and south.  The light illuminates the whole length.  There's a dead-end to the N, to the S it takes a sharp turn E.  There, unfortunately, is a heavy stench of urine that is starting to be covered by the smoke stench.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I can't fucking breathe in here for much longer. Let's hurry!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter runs to the South corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another short hall.  A hall to the N, then another at the far end to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter scopes out both turns.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short hallway on the N ends in a locked door.  The door to the S button-hooks around to head W.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid dives on forward S and W.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall curves north and ends in a locked door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter doubles back to the other door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He checks the door for traps.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Door is locked.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door looks really sturdy, but doesn't appear to be trapped.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume, I've always wanted to kick down a door. You with me?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Let's do this, boyo!"</p><p>(Strength check with adv, or attack roll - if you have unarmed attack - with adv.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door buckles, shakes.  Dust rains down from the cavern hall ceiling and comes back at the two from the shaking door.  A crack sounds, but the door still stands strong in the doorway.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is moaning coming from beyond the door.  Sounds like a handful of entities, all groaning loudly and approaching.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Uhhh, on second though, maybe we try the other door?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, shaking his head at the door.  "Woulda been interesting if we knocked it down in one, eh?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye. Aye aye aye."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Why do I get the feeling you're enjoying this?" <i>He winks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Could be me smile!" He smiles wide.  "Ahoy, lets see what else is gonna try and kill us down here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed. Maybe we listen a bit more closely <i>prior</i> to kicking this one in, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, then shakes his head, chuckling.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leans his ear up to the seam in the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seems fine.  You should totally go in.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok, this one's all clear. Let's do this!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door is unlocked and swings wildly in, banging against the interior wall.  The room is dimly lit by a small forge sitting against the north wall.   Various packs and belongings are scattered here and there, giving this room a look of being lived in, opposed to some of the other rooms you've visited.  There is a large tapestry on the E wall.  (Religion check for more info.)  There is also a ladder in the NW corner leading to a wooden trapdoor.  (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is still very interested in whatever is behind you guys, so he is wandering off back down the corridor.  Dieter senses a whirring, whoosing sound, but can't seem to see where the sound is coming from.  Doesn't seem like this room would have a draft...</p><p></p><p>As Dieter looks at the tapestry further, it is beautifully made, but very old.  Soot stains the majority of the fabric, but a simple decoration of a castle on a hill with various villagers and houses dotting the landscape can be seen.  Dieter looks closer, though, and through the simple weavings, he can see something else unfolding.  He puts his face almost right against it, staining his nose black with soot.  This might be the <i>back</i> of the original tapestry...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes note of the whirring but decides to take a look at the back of the tapestry first.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume hears the commotion and comes in, looking at the picture as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Good lord!" He notices Frume entering, "Have you ever seen anything like <i>this?</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Never.  Looks like a good knit, too.  Must be one of the Cult pieces, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I suppose so." Dieter takes a few minutes to commit the scene to memory, then goes in search of the noise, pressing his ears to the various wall whence the whirring is emanating.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks, searches, strains to hear and see what he was missing initially.  Nothing shows.  The small, hot fire crackles near the forge, that's all he hears now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Still bewildered, he begins knocking on the walls to try an hear any echoes beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No sounds emanate from the knocking, the walls are solid clay.  Scree falls here and there, but other than that, nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Frustrated at his seeming hallucination, Dieter makes his way to the SW door and checks for signs of traps mechanisms before checking whether it is locked.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter, wary of these doors down here, searches for traps.  Finding none, he checks the door.  It turns easily in his hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank goodness." He enters cautiously and casts glances around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short hall awaits beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He proceeds to the end and looks...left.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>...and again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid looks upon the end of the hall to a storage area, of sorts.  An armor stand is visible, holding a fine chain shirt.  There is a weapon rack attached to the E wall with two gleaming short swords.  A long sword is leaning against the NE corner.  At the base of the armor stand, a small chest is opened, revealing two standard potions of healing, and a third potion which Dieter is unable to identify on sight.</p><p>(I couldn't get the items set up visually in Roll20, sorry!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, ever cautious in this never-ending maze, peers over the items as it it's too good to be true. He looks again for any traplike shennanigans.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No traps, everything looks legit.  Nothing yells out at being magical at first glance, but everything looks very well made.  Maybe even elven in make.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Maouelue would love to see these...I hope he gets to some day..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Thinking fondly of his friend and the forge they made together, he swallows his misgivings about the metal armor in deference to practicality, then dons the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The chain shirt is exceptionally lightweight, fitting well to you.  The weapons seem light in your grip as well.  </p><p>(Roll arcana - at your own risk!   Mwahahaha!!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>.....................</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter runs his hands over the items, specifically the chain shirt.  A enormous pain settles in the base of his skull before he's halfway through with the process, and he's unable to complete the check.  (Take 1o points of psychic damage.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As pain rips through his head, he starts to get dizzy and sway.  Frume catches his arm and leads him to a sitting position on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Flippin flipper's flippers!!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yeeouuuuch!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whassamatter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The sooner we get out of this magic hell, the better. We've got to get to the coast. My energies dwindle..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm all for that.  Here, take these."  He hands you the potions of healing.  "Lets get up that ladder in the other room.  We should be directly underneath the guards room now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ok. I'll need to drink some of this now."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There ye go, lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aaahhhh...That's getting there."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank ye kindly good man."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I guess we'll just hold on to this other one for a bit until we find out what it is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  Lest ye be turned to a goat!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They pack up the equipment and head back over to the ladder. Dieter has changed out his dagger for a shortsword and donned the chain mail.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Eh Frume...I know my stuff is up there, but do you think we had better clear this place before heading up? You never know what we might find and that just might be the advantage we need up there, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"True, true.  But who knows how big this place is.  It's all over the place, I can't get a read on it.  Not to mention whoever was dissecting those bodies.  Rather not meet them without a bunch o' fighters at my back, I'll tell you true."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You make valid points there. Seems I've got a bit o' the lust as well! Well my good man, why don't you head up first, in case you recognize anyone?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sounds like a plan!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frume puts a hand on the ladder, two humanoid shapes appear out of nowhere and move to attack!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>SH1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (12) + 2 = <code>14</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>SH2 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (5) + 2 = <code>7</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Oh hell...well, at least we are equipped now..."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah!!  What in the nine hells are these things?!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Die you son of a bitch."  Frume stabs down and the shadow fades away, silently screaming.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter spits at the shady corpses. "There will be no dying of the light today."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wooo...  boyo.  I'm not feeling so well..."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume doesn't pass out, but he puts his hand back on the ladder to steady himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Time for me to help <i>you</i> friend. Let's head back to where we found the chest and take a moment to recover before we go further."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter offers a shoulder to lean on and helps support Frume back down the corridor to the secluded space by the small chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He tries to close the door behind them and find a way to secure it from opening. He considers a moment, then reaches in his pocket and pulls out the latent gem. He smirks, then pushes it into the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume leans on you and you feel like you're going to collapse as well.  (Strength save, please.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter falls to his knees under both the dead weight of Frume and the strength drain he's suffered as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whoa, whoa, lad.  Here, looks like we're both feeling low.  Let's just rest here."  He sits propped up on the nearest wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye..I...Aiiieee...agree..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leans back and succumbs to the weariness.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume, who's been sitting and honing his new shortsword along with checking out the makeshift forge, eyes Dieter waking.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hoy, there.  Feeling any better?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, just a bit... How about you? You took the brunt of that."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Updated and saved data for The Frumious Bandersnatch!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't think I did, lad.  I'm doing okay.  Better if we were outta this place, the faster the better, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agreed. Go on and head up and I'll be right behind you."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods to you, looking determined.  He climbs the ladder, each rung clasp echoing raspingly in the clay room.  As he gets to the hatch, he whispers down to Dieter, "There's a catch here, I'm going to slide it quiet and try to peek through."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Without any sounds, even to Dieter, Frume undoes the clasp and opens the hatch.  Then, quicker than a snake bite, he clambers up through the opening and opens the trapdoor completely.  He offers you a hand.  "We gotta be quick about this.  No one's here but there's bound to be someone soon.  Les go!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter follows quickly, astounded at the silent lightning that is his companion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two enter in a roughly 30x30ft room, cluttered with desks and parchment.  A table is pushed into a corner, where four chairs surround it, a card game interrupted lay on it's top.  No one is in the room, but you both can hear sounds of talking coming from down a hallway to the <s>N</s>  South.  You both come up into what is essentially the center of the room.  (I don't really have this up in Roll20, did you want a board or is theatre of the mind okay?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room also has a hallway going off to the W.   There are no sounds coming from that direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They seem pretty garbled.  Unlike the underground rooms, these up here are all made of fitted stone, and poorly kept, so the echoes are furious.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I think one of 'em is saying something about a lost prisoner...  Shite.  I think we make a run for it, but we need to be stealthy."  He looks around the room.  "Where in the bloody blazes did they put that trunk?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter examines the parchment and takes the playing cards for himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is looking for names, places, plans.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They're a deck of Three Dragon Ante, a very popular game in Faerun.  The parchment are various edicts and dictates about the law and how the questioning of prisoners should go.   Several are signed, they all look relatively official.  They've been strewn about the room, though, as if they're been gone over for information.  (Investigation if you want more info.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to perceive who is signing off on these papers and who might be the authorities involved, as well as whether the Runemark are for or against whomever has signed these.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The papers look old, and it's almost as if they've been magically protected against age, too.  The dates on some of them are outrageous, nowhere near where Dieter knows the date to be.  (Dieter sees the year 3129 on them, with a strange month tag that he doesn't recognize.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is nothing within the papers that he recognizes as belonging to the Runemark.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes 3 of the more interesting looking ones and begins to usher Frume out of the room quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They move West out of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the duo heads out of the room, moving down the westward corridor, the sounds of talking start getting louder from the northern passage.  The two exit just as a pair of voices enter the room behind them.  (Stealth checks, with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oughta get hazard pay for this shit, can't believe they're having us mount to look for these assholes.  They're probably still in the fucking castle.  I say, take every floor, search every room.  But no, no one listens to me."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oy, aren't you the one that said they're probably in the catacombs?  You're fulla horseshit!  I think Rock is right, they're way off'a the grounds.  Someone helped 'em escape, probably someone close to that Bander guy, and they're making a run for it.  Gonna be their surprise, nowhere to run to, aye?"  </p><p></p><p>The first voice is gruff, hardened, frustrated.  A man looking to take out some repressed emotions in the form of extreme physical violence.  The other has a rather rat-like sound to his voice.  Nasally, with words spat quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two sound like they're rummaging around the room for something.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume head further down the hall, into an area with rows of cell doors.  Some are bars on hinges where you can see into the cell.  Others are like the door Dieter and Frume were behind, heavy oak with banded iron bracings.  The latter are at the end of the hallway.  The very last one is standing ajar, an arm flopped outside of the opening.  As Dieter takes a few steps, Frume catches his arm.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cell door to their immediate right is lined with several chests.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gives a muffled start and looks at where Frume is beckoning. He checks the door as if to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens...  (Sleight of hand check, let's see if it squeaks 😟)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes his time, knowing the two thugs are basically right behind them.  Ever so slowly, he checks the handle.  It comes open with no sound, no resistance.  He looks around and with the caution born of survival, and the patience born of being a child of nature, he opens the door enough to let both he and Frume in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are three chests in this cell, the first one is wide open, nothing of importance is inside.  The second and third are against the remaining walls, both are closed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Frume, stay by the door for now and keep watch while I check these out.”, Dieter whispers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He makes his way over.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, draws his sword, and waits by the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first closed chest is unlocked and un-trapped.  There Dieter finds his clothes and incidentals.  The second chest is locked.  (Sleight of hand or strength to break it.  Or, if you have another idea...)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sizes up the chest and tests it’s weight.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tumbler gets caught.  Dieter tugs on the barb he's using and the lock <i>clicks</i> very audibly.  Luckily, or maybe not, at the same exact time, a bellow comes from the other room...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Who the FUCK took my cards!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter slips his ring of invisibility on quickly and feels a deep precious relief come over him. He raises a shushing finger to Frume as he does so and beckons him to stand back against the wall as out of sight as possible.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter vanishes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume smiles as he sees Dieter disappear.  He hides inside the cell.  (Luck check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Footsteps sound in the room, they're coming out of the West exit, heading right toward you.  As the men breach the hall, you see a lumbering, ugly brute with a heavily pock-marked face and baggy clothes trudge out in front of a weaselly looking guy that has missed a good number of meals.  He's gaunt and his eyes have a seriously haunted look.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter attempts to sneak by the brutes and create a distracting noise back in the card room by flapping the trap door and leaving a card next to it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The decptive, dissapearing Druid deftly dodges the daft dimwits detecting their direction. He slips out the cell gate and presses himself against the wall, having donned his Boots of Elvenkind, he is feeling particularly impish and fae. He tries to squeeze past the pursuers to make a distraction, hoping to prevent Frume's discovery.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big man feels something slip past him.  He says, "HEY!  Something's in this hallway!  Something just touched my arm!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Since you made the second check...)  The other man waves his hands around, checking the area around him.   Even though Dieter is <i>very</i> close to him, he says, "I don't feel anything!  You idiot, are you still eating those mushrooms?  I told you to stop eating those mushrooms, they're going to rot your brain!"  He pushes the big man from behind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter hurries over to make his mock escape down into the catacombs, loudly banging the trapdoor open and leaving a card "accidentally" on the ground next to it as he does so. He then backs into the corner near the W wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two hear the loud bang and rush to the spot.  They look at each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"They didn't."  They look incredulously at each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big bastard doesn't see the note, but the Weasel guy does.  He picks it up and looks at it...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bigger man goes down the trap door, the smaller man backtracks to the western hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door <i>thuds</i> close.  The small man sneaks into the hall.  He looks left.  He looks right...  into the eyes of Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter lunges up behind the man and puts him in a silencing chokehold.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>TH1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (13) + 0 = <code>13</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume runs out and tries to stab the guy in the gut.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guy is amazed at the rush of violence and barely brings his sword up to block anything.  Eye wide, he swipes out at the both of you, trying to hit either. (1-Dieter, 2-Frume)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter whispers, “Sleeeeep.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sleeeeep.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sleeeeep.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume puts his hand over the thugs mouth and stabs.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume catches the man, staring into his glassy eyes, and moves him into the cell with the chests.  Then, backing out quickly, shuts the doors and locks the dead man in.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter goes to quickly retrieve the playing card then searches the thief’s body for valuables.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><s>The guy has a couple coppers on him and a rusty knife.</s></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The duo head further west down the hall and Dieter takes the lead going invisible again.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Not a worry, just saw it.)</p><p>The guy had one gold, five silver, and a note of writ, mentioning a ransom for the escaped druid, Dieter Deleter.  The seal of the Runemark is marked in wax at the bottom of the parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s teeth look a bit like fangs as he snarls at the ransom note. He gives the thief’s corpse a swift kick before leading Frume down the hall. He takes the lead an invisibly scouts out the upcoming turns, listening for any significant movement or sound.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair move W, throwing the door at the end wide.  It was their former cell, the remains of what they could only assume is Culver is strewn about the room.  There is now a hole in the wall where the two escaped from.  The room is covered in blood, but something else seems off, too.  (Investigation check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room starts to spin as the sight of all that blood (and lack of flesh) begins to disgust Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Suppressing a retch, the disoriented Druid turns and beckons onward.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We need to get out of this hell trap. I need air. Did they say this was a castle? perhaps we can find a parapet and repel. Anything to get out of here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Les go back to the main room.  Thought I saw some doors in there.  There might be something across from that chest cell, too.  See about those areas first, I'll be on the lookout for any ladders up."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Upon further investigation, across from the chest cell, a smaller room had the look of just a standard cell.  Hidden in the shadows, a decrepit door stands.  The original room (with the tables and card game) has a door to the S, where you had heard the voices coming from.  (Investigation check for more!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a tapestry on the E wall, looks strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are muffled sounds coming from under the hatch, too.  They're fading, though.  Turning to mourning wails.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter expresses his newfound love of tapestries by lovingly investigating this one as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Looks like a nice work.  Mutli-hued.  Can't really make out the design on it.  It's really bulky, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter continues down the hall to meet Frume and look for additional ways of passage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a door across from the cell with the chests in it, a door in the S wall of the trap door room.  (Retconned the direction of that one because of the new map!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They check the door across from the cell, listening first for sounds behind it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is impressed by the door's construction, while Dieter listens intently.  No sounds are coming from the other side.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to open the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens to a dark room.  Sparse cobwebs linger in the corners, moldy and tattered hempen bags are scattered on the floor, mostly congregating in the corners.  There is another wooden door on the W side of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter casts a quick glance at the bags to determine what they might be containing, but mostly keeps moving forward.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On a quick glance, there's nothing there.  Rotted grains, decrepit cloth.  The next door is slightly ajar.  It opens into a strange storage room.  It's narrow and ends in bags of grain piled up to the ceiling.  There is light coming through several open places throughout the makeshift wall, leading you both to believe there is something beyond it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They begin baling the bags over to block up the door they just came in as they try to reveal what’s behind.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It takes a couple hours, the bags are heavier than they look, and the two are tired.  After the majority of them are moved off to the side, an alcove is presented.  Fresher (although not by much) bags and crates of vegetables and barley are packed into the W side of the room.  A handful of dried herbs hangs from the ceiling.  A barrel sits off to the side, a symbol of a boar's head emblazoned on it.  (Perception check, please, for general info.  Investigation for anything specific.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Also, there is a door leading to the E.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter considers the Boar’s Head symbol. Had he seen it somewhere before? He can’t be sure.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The two eat a bit of the fresh food while they take a moment to consider.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter opens the boar barrel, he happens upon salted pork jerky.  This also seems fairly fresh.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There also seems to be a slight breeze coming through the room.  The source might be coming from behind the crates and barrels.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>While chewing on a guilty pleasure, Dieter tries to sniff out the source of the draft. He beckons to Frume to help him move the obstructions about to aid in the search.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Looks like this is from the Dwarves!  Could be them up at Mithril Hall, or maybe up north in Ten-Towns, up Icewind Dale way.  Either way, the Dwarves know their salted meats!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The heavy items are moved out of the way, and a trap door 3ft by 3ft, is at the base of the wall.  It's locked with a hefty padlock.  A dank, fetid smell comes through the rotted knots.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks the sturdiness of the door itself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He plies at the wood of the trap door with the edge of a shortsword.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The whole thing just crumbles, the wood is wet and pills in Dieter's hands.  As the wood falls away, red streaks are left on Dieter's fingers.  A furnace blast of decay and iron hit both noses, and bile immediately rises in their throats.  (Con save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume turns quickly so the pork doesn't come up, but Dieter... isn't so lucky.  The corner gets splashes while the smell seems to permeate everything.   A snarl comes from the newly uncovered tunnel.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume bends down to see if his torch can light up the length of the tunnel at all.  It only goes a few feet in.  Dried blood cakes the inside, giving the tunnel the look like the interior of some infernal beast.  Frume has a kerchief pulled over his nose and mouth, offers another to Dieter.  </p><p>"What say we board this damned portal up?"  A moaning comes from the other end in an ominous answer.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What new devilry...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls his blades out and lets out a low growl.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whoa, friend."  Frume starts looking for things to block up the tunnel.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He starts pulling grain bags over, slowly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gathers himself and moves a barrel over on top of the trap.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods and helps him.  "That should do it.  I think."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He runs over to the door and rushes through it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A hallway ends 20ft ahead, a small entrance to another room is on the right.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They bolt down the hallway away from the wretched retch and inspect the next room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The duo heads down the hall, Frume pausing to slam the door closed.  He rushes after Dieter, the two turn the corner and are greeted with a very interesting sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mucus looks sickly, and the body is sluggish, the eye stalks droop heavily.  It does not respond to your noise from the hallway.   The shell on it's back shimmers a rainbow of colors, even in the dim light of the room.  Even in it's somewhat emaciated condition, it's huge, and takes up the entire room.  Beyond it, the two adventurers can see another makeshift wall of grain bags.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter studies the <i>beast's</i> form. He draws on his acute learnings of history and nature and melds them with his natural affinity to the amphibious. He feels something wild within him growing. What is the name of this new wonder of the shell?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter taps into his druidic nature and comes up with the name "Flail Snail".  He knows that this creature can emit very bright light from it's shell, which it isn't doing at the moment.  The shell also emits an anti-magic shield, and some also have a bit of wild magic imbued.  Some sects of paladins strictly use shields made from the flail snail's shell because of the anti-magic properties it exhibits.  Dieter also gets a sense that this snail might be sick, all the signs point to either extreme exhaustion or illness.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter feels the pain of this sick snail and searches the room for signs of manipulation and abuse of the poor being.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He assumes a preliminary bedside manner and attempts to show the snail he means no harm.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Frume, go grab some of those herbs if you can. This one looks like as much of a captive as us."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks at Dieter.  "You, uh...  You want me to go back... in there?"  He points to the room down the hallway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Now that Frume mentions it, you do hear a kind of scratching coming from down that hallway.  Like nails on wood...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh, I guess not." He turns back to the sickly snail and tries to catch its eyes, raising his hands in a non-threatening way. He pulls out his water skin and sprays a few ounces down in front of the snail's visage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A little pool of water forms at he snails front, a couple long, droopy stalks find their way to it and lap it up greedily.  A small bit of color comes into the grey flesh of the animal, giving Dieter some hope for it's survival.  From the druid's cursory medical check of the creature, the biggest takeaway is that the animal hasn't eaten for quite some time.  And, upon further inspection of the shell, it feels to Dieter as if some of the anti-magic power is being siphoned off somehow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter pulls out a hunk of snake meat from his pack that he hopes has survived well enough for his purpose. He sets it in front of the snail and backs away deferentially.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Guard the rear," Dieter whispers to Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The meat looks blackened and partially rotted.  The snails eye stalks shoot up, stare at the meat, then a maw opens wide from the bottom of the greyish flesh, a wide toothless mouth, and it scarfs the morsel in one bite.  Eyes stalks close as it devours the decaying snake meat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sounds of heavy pawing at the door behind you can be heard.  The low moan that was heard from the darkened tunnel starts again from the previous room now.  Frume takes a few more steps towards it to investigate.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The smell becomes too much for him and he retreats.  "I'm going to get these bags down, help me cover this doorway with them, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks back and sees his struggling companion. He takes his remaining three hunks of snake meat and lays them out for the snail before joining and helping barricade the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“With our powers combined!....urrrgggghhhh...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>These bags are much heavier.  Either that, or you guys are much more tired than you realized.  (Contested check coming up.  Dieter and Frume roll  D20 each.  The thing on the other side of the door is going to roll a d20-5.  This is going to be how long it will take the boys to block up the hall vs. the thing to break down it's door.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(15+9)/2 = 12</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men get to work hauling bag after bag.  Sweat pours from their faces.  Occasionally an eye stalk pokes out and relieves them of their perspiration.  Another bag goes on the top, the clawing from the other side starts to beat frantically on the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall is blocked about three-quarters of the way up.  Dieter hauls another bag over, Frume is just about to heave it atop the pile when <i>bang</i>!  The two hear the door flung wide and crash against the stone wall, probably shattering it to pieces.  A lumbering, unnatural sound comes down the hall.  Frume just finishes throwing the last bag up when a pale appendage comes over the top of the barrier, searching frantically.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stench that follows is beyond nauseating, and the snail even seems affected.  It starts to batter against the bags in front of it, knocking a few out of the way, opening that clearance a bit more.  The appendage that hangs over the barrier is...  odd.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It looks as if...  it was a leg.  But that can't be right, because the end is clearly an arm.  A hand?  But the hand looks odd, too.  Like it has too many digits...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I think we’ve discovered the results of whomever’s foul handiwork we espied in the catacombs...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You can say that again."  He gulps.  It would be comedic, except for the situation.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter produces a flame and sets it atop the gap in the barricade.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us hope that holds them a bit!” </p><p>He turns back to the ascending affection of the snail. He takes a long look into its eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The fire instantly consumes the first row of grain bags, causing the thing to retract it's appendage.  (Dealing damage, I'll roll in a sec.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume cocks his head at the barrier fire.  "Um..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We should go.  Probably now, aye?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both watch as the fire careens down the side of the barrier.  There's probably not much time until there is an explosion!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Quickly now!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads on and pleadingly looks at the snail to follow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail nuzzles you, searching for more food, while at the same time moving out of the room for fear of the fire.  The room beyond the former grain-bag wall is covered in straw, or maybe what remains of an old rug.  There is a lazy brazier in the corner, not doing much to give out heat or warmth.  Standard wooden doors are to the W and S.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail sails over the bags without any issue, surprising Frume!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks on admiringly at the snail and bequeathes his two Baobab Berries as a gesture of bonding.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Immediately you see color return to the snails greyish flesh.  It turns an amber color, blood can be seen coursing through it's vessels below the skin.  The shell regains more luster, too, and a dim light, getting brighter by the second, starts emanating from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks both doors, opening them quickly and surveying the rooms beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The W door opens to another corridor, roughly 35ft long.  It ends in stone double doors to the S, while a wooden door on the W side looks slightly ajar.  The S door opens to another storage room, various sundry items and foodstuff abound.  More of the pork jerky and cheese can be found here, along with eggs, herbs, and a strange box with what looks to be a stylized fish on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hey Shelli, you still hungry girl?” He proffers the inventory to his new pet, then inspects one of the fish boxes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The box is very well sealed, and a very familiar, fishy aroma greets Dieter when he opens it.  A waxed cloth encloses some of the finest black caviar Dieter has ever seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, this might trade for a fair penny, if we ever get the chance...” He stows the caviar then eats a few hunks of cheese, forgoing the pork and looking for some mint to settle his stomach.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Not only do you find some hanging peppermint and spearmint, you also find basil, oregano, and a plethora of fancier herbs for cooking and herbalism.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh these will make the road life much more bearable.” He stows a healthy amount then beckons for the duo to follow him down to the stone doors.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume finds a pack and starts stuffing food in, particularly the cheese and pork.  He follows with a piece of jerky hanging out of his mouth.  He tosses a very moldy cheese wheel towards Shelli, who snatches it out of the air.  Her shell shimmers gratefully.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is snarling coming from behind the stone doors.  Ripping and tearing of something as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, there is a MASSIVE <b><i>BOOM</i></b>!  Stone, grain, dust, and other debris rockets out from the door at the N end of the hall, smashing into the wall opposite the door.  An inhuman <i>screech</i> is heard from the former room as flames pour out of the former doorway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Frume turn to look as a charred abomination clambers out through the newly made hole in the wall.  It walks like a crab or scorpion, smaller appendages in the front, getting bigger the farther up the body they go.  Six appendages in all.  They seem to be an amalgamation of leg and arm bones, ending in a perverse mashup of feet, hands, and claws.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The body, despite being charred, is the torso of a human, but everything is stitched together backwards.  The shoulders and head are at an angle as to let the thing crawl, but still be able to look around at its environment.  Like a scorpion mixed with a centaur, the thing rears up on its hind legs when it sees you and the snail.  To more appendages flick out from it's back, a mixture between a tentacle and a scorpions stinging tail.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sharpen your shell Shelli, we’re in for a fight!”</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He gets the doors slightly ajar...  And slams them shut.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Um...  I'm not sure which I'd rather, honestly..."</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"AH, HOLY SHIT THAT HURTS!!" yells Frume as a stinger pierces his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go get her....er....it...Shelli!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli slimes over and matches tentacle for abominable arm with the decrepit, soulless pile of limbs.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume throws his dagger, missing the creature badly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shakes his head, then takes a short running lead.  He jumps on Shelli's shell, and stabs down at the monster!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sword slices through a few appendages.  They flop to the ground, twitching with retained electrical impulses.  Frume lands on the opposite side of the creature, laughing.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The monstrosity, on it's last legs... er...  appendages grabs an eyestalk of Shelli's and <i>rips</i> it out.  The snail lets out a small shriek, dark ichor spraying the creature and the ground around them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You bitch!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“You ok Shelli? Look what that friend did to you!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume picks up his dagger from the ground.  "Okay, Dieter, we have bad news, and worse news.  Which one do ya want first?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The less time we waste the better, leave the rhetorics to the romantics.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter reclaims his boomerang as he tends to Shelli’s wounds.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Okay, well...  that explosion's going to be bringing the cavalry.  Second, just beyond that door is a black dragon.  We can either go in guns blazing, try this room here (he points to the now broken door on the W wall), or we maybe try to get back to the catacombs, try our luck there.  Either way, doesn't look...  the greatest."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“By the grace of the grotto! A black dragon!?!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I mean...they’d be mad to follow us....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Was he chained?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Mighta been.  Didn't look <i>that</i> closely.  I was more concentrating on the fact that it was eating something."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Something with bones..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, how about this, we open that door to the Dragon and hide off this side chamber and await to ambush should they be so daft as to charge down the dragon. I’ll use my ring to remain hidden while I open the door.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sheila, get ready to mass stun!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shrugs. "Sounds like a good a plan as any.  I'll jump into this side room here.  We'll see what happens, eh?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume heads into the side room.  "What. In. The.  Shit."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is very distracted by either Frume, or Shelli, or the remaining fire from the other room, or the black dragon...  Lots on his mind at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What now Frume?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter enters the side room, another strange sight greets him.  For no apparent reason, there is a goblin tent set up in here.  A small, greasy fire is burnt into the stone floor.  Three barrels of foul smelling liquid are seeping through broken slats in the corner, dampening the floor.  Inside the tent, three dead goblins can be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume just stares at Dieter, as if to say, 'What the hell is this?'</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Not sparing a moment, Dieter says, “Help me with these Barrels!” He has Frume help him move the barrels into their growing booby trap in front of the dragon door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two move the barrels pretty quickly to block the double doors.  The three just barely stretch across their length, but it looks like it should hold if anyone were to try to open them.  Unless they open outwards from this room...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter tries to determine what is in the barrels. “Back up Frume”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume backs up.  Dieter prepares, but just as he's about to make a move, the double doors start opening towards the heroes...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter taps his ring, instinctively going invisible.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume flops into the other room.  The snail stays put.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter gets busy uncorking a barrel and seeing whether he can tip it over in time.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doors swing wide open, banging against the stone walls.  A regal man steps in.  Coarse, curly black hair sits atop a stern looking, young man's face.  Even though he is young, his face is battle-scarred; a long, thin wound, partially healed, carved his face from left temple to right jaw.   He's covered in plate mail that looked hale but battered.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He strides into the room as if he owns the air people breath.  His frown looks ironed on, as if its a permanent fixture.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Behind him, a few paces back, is a skeleton crew.  Quite literally.  A room full of skeletons can be seen beyond the man.  At his heels, a wight stalks.  The zombie-looking man has long, stringy hair.  Studded leather armor glistens in the hazy light of the flail snails shimmery shell.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He doesn't see Dieter finishing with the barrel.  He only has eyes for the room on the W wall.  He runs to it, nearly knocking over the barrels as he does so.  He almost knocks over the snail, too, trying to force his way in.  "Out of my way, you filthy, slimy creature."  His voice is nasal, and heavily affected by high-born speech.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He races into the room and disappears from Dieter's view.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli's shell shimmer and light bursts forth, a blinding flash, surprising everyone.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wight, shielding his eyes, unsheathes his weapon and moves toward the snail.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wight is blown back by the boomerang, coming out of nowhere.  His hands fly away from his eyes, leaving him exposed for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And he is stunned, shaking his head, trying to rid his vision of the spots.  The snail lets out a victorious cry!</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing doing, now he's stalking towards Frume.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Maybe try draconic, aye?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“YOU THINK IF I KNEW IT I WOULDN’T HAVR TRIED THAT FIRST! DO YOU KNOW IT?!?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Tiamat! Hear me! Teach me to speak amongst your glory!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"WHY WOULD I KNOW IT?!  You know Abyssal!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dragon cocks it's head at you at the mention of Tiamat.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter produces a flame in one hand and holds a serpent amulet in the other, then slowly walks out to face the black dragon.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I come to seek the guidance of one who knows Tiamat.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter lowers his head but keeps his eyes on the drake.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The over-large maw stretches all the way down either side of the black dragon's face, giving it a macabre, menacing look.  The black eyes, pupil-less, stare straight at the druid.  It smacks its mouth, acid spittle dripping from it's teeth.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Not blinking, not looking away from the dragon’s gaze Dieter lays out the amulet facing the gigantic maw. He sets his flame in the center of the neckband and begins to ritually line up his vials of poison around the outside of the makeshift shrine. He finishes with the Neogi venom at the 12 O’clock position in front of the amulet. </p><p>“Tiamat, take these gifts that our minds might connect.”</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dragon pops its front paws on the closest upright barrel.  He begins sniffing the air, completely ignoring the makeshift altar.  The huge maw opens, the tongue lolls out.  Dieter notices, now, that this is very close to a baby dragon, maybe a few years old at most.  And it is extremely hungry.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tongue laps at the sharp teeth, the two men back away.  Shelli shakes in her shell.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dragon turns its head to the remnants of the fire in the other room.  Sniffs again. Then pops down from the barrel and trundles over to Shelli's former prison and starts snacking on what's left of the pantry items.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, slightly embarrassed considering, picks up the altar pieces and stows them back in their various locations. He takes a moment to spread the contents of one of his poison vials over his armaments.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Twas a good idea, lad.  Maybe we can take a look in the cave before we bust outta this place?"</p><p>(Probably best.  If you were to level up and update now, you'd get all your spell slots and such back.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The experience with the dragon and Shelli have struck a chord deep in the spirit of the developing Druid. He feels the pull back to the coast embodied by Shelli, whose amphibious nature and steadfast presence remind him of the sea and of home. The dragon, the fleeting, yet acquiescent power, the stoic serpentine stature, key him into the deep mystery at play here and the opaque stakes, the depths of which he is sure he has not even begun to plumb. </p><p></p><p>Dieter leads away into a quiet corner and beckons the Bandersnatch to stand guard a moment while he recovers himself and meditates on all that is new.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sure, no problem lad."  Frume splits his attention between the seemingly illusory goblin tent and the hallway from whence the small battalion just came.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's move! I need more time to do this properly. Frume, take the rearguard, Shelli, well...follow as quickly as you can!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter leads them through the room of Dragon carnage and stops short to take a closer look at the place now the dragon has moved on.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Everyone, get in here and let's bar these doors."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume begins to do so, ushering Shelli in as fast as they both can.  Besides the skeleton-cide that happened in here, it looks like it was once nicely furnished as a trophy room.  Various stuffed animal heads, including a small red dragon, are mounted on the stone walls.  Interesting creatures abound in here.  You also take notice, through every room you've passed, you haven't seen any windows...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks around for any valuables, then asks of Frume, "Just how did you disappear with the Captain? And what of that strange Goblin hut?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a door, stone, on the E wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter meanders over to the Red Dragon head to give it a thorough inspection.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, now that's a story!  So, I'm running into the room, really I was falling into it, trying to get away from whatever was coming through those doors.  Thought I would hide in the goblin's tent and surprise him, like.  Only, when I take a step in, there are these stairs, and everything is pitch black.   I stumble a bit, fall, catch meself on the dirt floor, a few feet down.  I'm totally thrown but I have enough wits about me to get the hell outta the way, in case something else comes clambering down like I did.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, as I move off the dirt path, I see the oval shapes all around me.  Black upon black they were, almost couldn't make 'em out.  My torch went kaput, so I had to feel my way around.  These things were hot to the touch, so I put two an two together, came up with four, and realized they were dragons eggs!  Then this big bloke comes in, searching for something.  Snuck up and gave him a whack on the back o' the noggin.  Then I ran out as fast as I could.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"If you ask me, looks like they're making a dragon army with all those eggs in there.  Or feeding something humongous."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"By the breath of the sea mother...A DRAGON ARMY?!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"This bears careful thought. Did you get a sense of...how heavy those eggs are? How long do you think he'll be out?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, maybe?  Who knows what these... crazies do or why.  I bet he'll be out for a few minutes, but frankly he could be coming too any minute.  The door's shut, if we can wedge it closed somehow, that should buy us some more time."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed...though I hate to think what foul deeds might become of those dragon eggs one way or another. Do we not have a responsibility to do something about it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Though, might better to get out alive and maybe do aught on the other side of the wall as well..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter grimaces, but steels his mind. "Right. We flee East."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Before he turns, he looks back to the Red Dragon and considers taking a little memento.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume takes an antelope head from the wall and wedges it under the doors.  The scraping grates on the ear.</p><p>The mounted dragon head is bulky and, in all sense of taste and class, abhorrent.  The look it's giving, the size of it, the actual taxidermy...  Not well done at all.  But it could work as a memento or a specific buyer might pay a good sum for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter, is looking at the horns and teeth, presumably the eyes have been replaced by something or other as surely a Dragons real eyes would not sustain in this way.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door E grates on the stone floor, crumbling pebbles acting as pumice to the floor beneath.  The heroes look through and see a long room, bedecked with gadrooned columns and torches lit irregularly on the rough stone walls.  There is an air to this room, a somber, creepy feel.  A breeze blows through, rustling tapestries attached to several columns.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The floor also tracks downward toward the end of the hall approximately 60 feet away, dropping in all about 15 feet.  There are three doors on that end of the room, one on each side, W, S, and E.  There is something carved in them, but you can't tell from this vantage point.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>From the far end of the room, Dieter can tell there are four separate banners.  All different colors, they look to have different insignias on them as well.  The doors, although still hard to make out, have an odd type of lock on them, which is what is carved into them.  There are no handles on the W and S doors, but the door to the E has one.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You also hear the wind stir, but you can't make out what's creating the draft.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Taking what he can of the dragon bone, Dieter hurries the crew into the East room. Ever cautious, they close the large doors behind them again. He works with Frume to closer identify the insignias and lock patterns on each door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter starts dissecting this mounted dragon, it falls apart in his hands.  The skin, brittle as paper, flakes away.  The musculature wasn't treated properly and turns to dust in his hands.  The teeth and horns, however, and decently intact.  You get two horns and ten teeth.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first is a symbol of the Zhentarim, a cabal of merchants, thugs, and assassins bent on cornering every market and town for themselves.  They have no scruples and care for nothing save money and power.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The second is the mark of the Cult of the Dragon.  There are many off-shoots, but this is  the main symbol created by lich Sammaster.  Their ultimate goal is to raise the dragons and dragon-kin to their rightful place in the world - above all.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The third is the mark of the Arcane Brotherhood.  Frume pipes in about this one, as he mentions he has dealings with the city of Luskan<s>, or which it is now known as, the City of Anarchy.</s>  They are a fringe society, but what they lack in notoriety, they make up for in pure ambition and magical prowess.  There are a set number of seats in the brotherhood, one has to die in order for another to be raised into the sect.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last...  eludes even Frume.  He scratches his head.  "Looks like a death cult of some kind, but I'm damned if I know.  You feel that chill, by the way?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Follow the air. It will guide us out." <i>I hope...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter goes over to the East door and checks the handle while feeling around for the draft.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Feeling a draconic irony overcome him, Dieter hands Frume a bottle of Gold Dragon Ale and pulls one for himself as well. His third and final, he proffers to Shelli, seeking any sign of interest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snail sticks her... nose (?) up at the brew, but Frume taps your bottle and says, "Fucking cheers to that!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The E door is closed, but not locked.  The carvings read oddly, a few have been scratched away.  Frume meanders to the S door, burping small flames every now and again.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Whatcha make of these carvings, Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stows the third ale, knowing what it does now, he hopes to see the look on Maouelue's face when he gets the chance to quaff this last.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He traipses over to Frume all the while keeping a nose out for the source of the wind.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Druid's eyes flick back and forth over the distressed carvings.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The breeze feels like it's coming from different directions at different times.  (Arcana check for the doors, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's tough because these look like they're legible, but the language is either very ancient, or set up to trick your eyes when you read it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter turns back to his search for the wind. He produces a flame to help guide him in the direction of the draft, watching as the flames are pushed this way and that.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame in his hand flutters, dives.  Corrects and becomes still.  Then violently wavers again.  It becomes like bubbling, boiling water.  It grows in size, double, now treble the size it once was.  In shadows above, gliding down, is a shadow spectre, wrapped in grey smoke and floating down directly at the druid!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter releases the flame and steps backward, assessing his options.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>With what time he has, he takes note of the spectre’s shape and form trying to perceive its alignment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's ethereal, swathed in smoke.  It is not being aggressive, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Greetings, dark spirit.” Dieter coughs in his best abyssal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The smoke roils and expands.  A hoarse scream comes from the center of the entity.  Dieter looks and Frume and the spectre are holding their heads in their hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume hits the floor, a line of blood running from his nose.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Something you want to tell me, Frume?!?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That voice, lad.  Cuts straight to my brain, I guess."  He wipes the blood away as he comes to sitting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spectre stays hovering, but is backed further away.  There is a soft blue light illuminating the smoke now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This time Dieter slowly approaches the light making no vocalization. He walks steadily and reaches out for the blue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ghost reaches out for Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter makes to take its....hand?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I will not be overtaken. I am here to commune.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The visage seems to cock it's head.  A message, a soft voice in the back of Dieter's head, barely audible, speaks, "Can't.  Have to. Show."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is feeling the dark pull. The thirst for knowledge. The thirst for the power to drive his own destiny....</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a deep breath of smoke.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid is engulfed in smoke.  Frume gasps and reaches out for his friend, but his hand encloses on nothing.  Dieter is transformed...  And the two beings.  Vanish.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>We last left Maouelue and Daran on the road back to Oakhurst.  They've taken a side road as to stay away from the Runemark's men.  As they make their way down the trail, they're on the lookout for enemies.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran has a keen eye and he constantly looks toward the horizon for any hints of trouble.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The weather is overcast, looking on the verge of rain.  Daran smiles at the clouds.  The duo make their way down the road in safety.  (D100, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>While walking down the road, the pair round a bend and see a human woman, clutching her leg, prone in the middle of the road.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue calls out in her most cloying voice, "Oh dear, my fellow lady, are you in need of assistance? What happened here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"OW!  Someone shot me!  Please help me!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Ouelue gets closer, she notices a bolt sticking out of the woman's hamstring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Surely darlin' you would be so kind as to help this distressed maiden here. You know I haven't the...color for such work. That's a dear..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran eyes Ouelue askance and moves to check the woman over.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"This is in too far for me to do anything.  We have to move you."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger goes to wrap his arms underneath the woman, and she screams.  Shaking her head, she says, "No, it hurts too much.  Damn!  Here.  Please.  I need to get this to Kennet Arrunson.  He runs the Pig and Falcon in Oakhurst.  This needs to get to him tonight.  Can you do this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We can't just leave her here..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue braces and approaches the lady. She stifles a retch and lays her hands around the wound.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran scans the surrounding area.  "Keep an eye."  He turns around 360 degrees to search the woods.  To the woman, he says, "Did you see where the shot came from?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman shakes her head.  She then says, "Thank you lady.  Ah.  It still hurts.  Here, please take this."  She brings out a silvered feather pin and asks, "Can I pin this to you and deputize you into the messenger guild?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Nay...You will be healed."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"This may sting a bit..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue pulls hard at the bolt and presses the wound, beginning to chant.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes go wide.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bolt catches on something, she screams and...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Stays conscious, but just barely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We need to get off the road.  All of us."  Daran looks at Ouelue meaningfully.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm sorry about that. I thought I could do better." <i>shudder</i></p><p>Here, take these for your pain and patience. We'll deliver this for you."</p><p>Ouelue takes the Messenger Guild pin and adorns it on her breast. She then digs in her pack and hands over the Tao of Earth and the jar of glowing red mushrooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue heeds her hubby's humble heckling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hefts the woman under her arms and drags her, a little roughly, eyes always scanning, into a copse of tall grass.  Tall enough to hide them, but not well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman accedes to being dragged.  She then looks at the new items in her hands with confusion. "What are these?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sets the woman down more gently, then draws his bow and, with a finger to his lips as a warning, he wades back to the road silently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well to be honest, some good reading and...something to...er...experiment with should the reading become too dry.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She shrugs, saying, "Uh..  Thank.  You..."  She looks at the mushrooms in the jar.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Ouelue realizes, she cannot hear nor see Daran.  He is very stealthy, but she can neither see nor hear him anywhere.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(S)he pats her pack seeking the net of invisibility.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(I believe you grabbed it the last you used it?)  </p><p>The woman opens the jar, makes a face, then politely puts the top back on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few minutes later, Daran creeps back into the area looking frustrated.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What did you spy there Daran.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Not a damn thing.  Which worries me."  To the woman, "Who is after you?  Or is it the letter someone is after?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We will deliver this message with all haste. May we lead the pursuant away.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, we must hurry!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"If we leave this woman, and she doesn't have the letter, she dies.  Do you have anything that can help her?  Or magics that can spirit her away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue places the amulet of health around the maid’s neck and whispers a prayer to the lord to send forth its healing and to aid them in their mission.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, following Ouelue's direction.  He roots around in his pack, pulls out a strip of leather that could be a belt or strap.  "Put this in your mouth and bite down," he tells her.  She does, and he grips the bolt.  "Why don't you try to pull that out one more time, this time you'll have my help."  He braces the leg and the woman, motioning Ouelue to remove the barb.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This time Ouelue lends all her empathy into feeling how the bolt is lodged and reaches out with her feelings...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"This should work, but let us keep to the edge of the road, and let us move quickly."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s make for Oakhurst in a hurry.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@SuoRess</p><p>Rolling 3 iterations, DC 10...</p><p>1d20 (17) + 10 = </p><p>1d20 (10) + 10 = </p><p>1d20 (7) + 10 = </p><p>3 successes, 64 total.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crew travels lightly, all three moving with amazing stealth and precision.  Only once does Daran think he sees something following them, and backtracks a bit.  After a few minutes, he rejoins the group and pushes them on.  As the clouds open up, the trio emerges from a group of trees and the village of Oakhurst is visible on the horizon.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A wave of emotion overcomes Ouelue as (s)he sees the town for the first time in what feels like weeks underground. Anxious to determine Dieter’s dilemma, (s)he pushes forth with haste.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Dragon Mage enters a surreal town, one he knows and doesn't at the same time.  Burned buildings, few children and families are in the streets.  The dead lay with rain pattering them, only those they left behind to carry them to their graves.  </p><p></p><p>There are a handful of buildings still upright and somewhat intact.  The inn, the tavern, a few homes, Vam's ranch...   These all, at least from first glance, seem okay.  The three enter the crossroads proper and scan in all directions.  The Runemark's men didn't raze everything, but the town is still only a shell of it's former self.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stands speechless. he cannot fathom what kind of evil soul would do such a thing. </p><p>“Those bastards will pay for this...”</p><p>He leads the group onward toward the ranch, hoping to get a word in with Vam and potentially Heston before heading into the wreckage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group turns W, led by Ouelue, they see a rough-and-tumble man, early thirties, dusty blonde hair tied into a tight bun at the back of his head, stubble darkening his weather-beaten face.  He leads a big brown gelding NW through the town.  He wears normal rancher's clothes, but atop them, a set of emerald green snakeskin chaps, a vest, and bracers indicate him as Heston, the tailor/ranch-hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"That's a fine bit of snakeskin work there...Reminds me of a time I loaned out summat around these parts."</p><p>Ouelue winks meaningfully at Heston. </p><p>"I have desire to speak to Vam and hit Leatherworker as well. We bring tidings from the Manor..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranch-hand gives the group a strange, suspicious look.  "Aye, head over yon.  Vam's a bit beat up, but he'll see ya.  It's a bad time to be comin' inta town, just to let y'all know.  I'd be headin' out as soon as ye can.  Just some friendly advice."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman grabs Ouelue by the arm.  "Excuse me, miss.  If I could have that letter back, I must deliver it right away to the Pig and Falcon.  I appreciate all your help.  Both of you."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes yes, of course. Here. And your pin as well.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue waits for her to be out of earshot, then leans closer to Heston.</p><p>He whispers,</p><p>“It is I...Maouelue. Prithee take a moment to catch me up with Vam...”</p><p>“...That is some fine snakeskin.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman nods, and leaves quickly, making for the tavern.  Looking at it, the Pig and Falcon is surprisingly free of burn marks...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston does a double take, then looks Ouelue deep in her eyes.  He drops the reins and gives the mage a hug, saying, "I knew you'd come back.  The others...  they said you'd abandoned us to those monsters, but Vam and I...  we'd knew you'd come back to help."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue surprises himself with how passionately he returns the embrace. He is <i>relieved</i> to be back in town regardless of its state. There are wrongs here that need to be righted, and the return of Heston to his sight instills the vigor of purpose and direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, this is my good man Heston. He is a friend in this. Come Heston, let us away with these tidings to Vam.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A bit embarrassed, but still a hardened cattle-man, breaks away from Maouelue/Ouelue.  He then shakes the rangers hand.  Surprisingly it is Daran that looks sheepish.  (Insight check for more!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man reminds Daran of someone. Mao can tell that, but no more.</p><p>Heston motions the two to follow him.  They head towards the ranch, which looks very battered indeed.  The farmland around it has been burned, part of the horse barn is collapsed, most of it has black soot marks all over.  The street in front still show the cracks from the serpent attacks.  The trio move quickly up the front steps and into the small ranch.  Heston waves at a couple women doing chores in the main room.  He leads the ranger and the druid to the back room on the first floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Opening the door slowly, quietly, he shows the others Vam.  Lying still in a bed, thin covers down to his waist, the man is bandaged over most of the top of his body.  Wet cloths hide the misery and pain beneath.  The skin that is visible is red, raw.  Vam is looking out the window opposite the group that just entered.  He doesn't turn his head when he says, "Knew you'd come.  Heston wouldn't've brought anyone else in here."  He turns his head to look at the trio.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Half of his face is covered in red, splotchy bandages.  The other side is wet with perspiration.  The black skin is cracked, distressed.  Like his eyes.  He tries to make sense of what he's seeing; a woman, an elf, and Heston.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Forgive my glamour, it is I, Maouleue. My poor soul, what has happened here?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Cleric Mage immediately falls to his knees aside the flayed man and begins praying with bowed head and radiant spirit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His eye becomes calmer, more... hopeful.  He beckons Maouelue in.  He tries to reach for the woman's shoulder, to comfort her, but is too weak to even find it.  After a few flailing attempts, his arm flops down and he takes a shuddering sigh.  His voice comes out as smoke and gravel.  "I appreciate you coming back.   But you shouldn't have.  The glamour is a good idea.  They came looking for you.  Pretty much right after you took off for those snakes."  He coughs.  "Seems like ten years ago, now.  Damn.  They came in the middle of the night, fires blazing.  Took down pretty much everyone.  Dragged the rest away.  Put a few to the question, then lit 'em up in the middle of town.  Like a fuckin' funeral pyre."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He coughs again, it wracks his body and he double over, causing more spasms.  Daran heads to the other side of him and commences with his magics.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Nine Devils.....I will suffer their filth  <i>NO LONGER!</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam's body rises above the bed, then the spells his.  Immediately, the coughing abates.  The three watch as skin knits together.  Red welts of burn damage close.  The man takes a deeper breath, then starts to laugh.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You boys treat me too well, you know that.  By the gods, I'm tired."  He chuckles again and settles back in the bed.  "Shit was horrible before you go blaming yourself.  Three of the council being Muhlen's, no one knowing a damned thing about it...  Yeah, shit was done before you broke it open.  Hell, if you boys hadn't, we probably would have still be tripping along to their merry little melody.  This town owes you a debt it won't be able to fulfil.  Maybe that's what happened here.  The fates taking theirs."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shifts to look at Maouelue.  "Either way, they're looking for you and unless you've got an army behind you, I'd say steer clear.  At least for the time being."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A woman's voice comes softly from the doorway.  "Were my ministrations too rigorous for you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue raises an eye at the intrusion and puts on an air of welcome into the clerical fold, while remaining vigilant under the mask and taking in every inch of the newcomer.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A raven-haired woman stands meekly in the doorway.  Bits of dirt and moss slightly mar her stark white skin.  She is a beauty to behold, though.  Bellatrix's head is bowed at the woman before her, waiting for either a reprimand on her work, or to be run out of town.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Bellatrix! Do mine eyes deceive me?!...Alas, I’ve made sure yours do you! My dear, fellow healer, please ignore my glamorous appearance. It is I, Maouleue. I am here to finish what I no doubt didn’t start, but sure as hell raked up!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Maouelue?!  Well, that is good news!"  She goes to shake, but decides to curtsy instead.  "And this must be Dieter, welcome back goodsirs."  She curtsies again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Ouelue chuckles.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ah no, hehe...yes, I suppose that one’s on me. This here is my acquaintance and well, savior of a sort, Daran. He has shown me good faith and broken bread with me of his own accord. He helped me in a time of great need as did you that one...fateful day...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, meet Bellatrix, a healer, friend, and if I dare say, a longer sufferer of these machinations than myself. Heston and Vam can vouch as well.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“But pardon the pleasantries, pray can we pull up by the hearth and take on some warm vittles? We need to make a plan and fast. We would have news of what moves in these parts, if you can give them.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger stands and folds his arm across his chest, bows to the woman.  Bellatrix is taken aback for a moment by the show of chivalry, then smiles at Ouelue.  "Handsome <i>and</i> good with formalities.  I'm impressed with the company you keep, good wizard."  She curtsies back to Daran.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam sits up, waves a hand to say he's okay to do so, and starts to rise.  "Let's head to the fire.  I'd like some... vittles, too."  He smirks at Ouelue.  Softly, to the wizard, he says, "Pardon me saying, you make a comely lass, friend."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hah! You should have known him when his name was Truth-or-Daran!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Aye, and I make a lassie come!</i>” <i>He winks privately to Vam.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam busts out laughing.  He puts an arm around Ouelue, partially to help lead him out, partially because he might fall over for laughing too hard.  Daran, almost imperceptibly, blushes and follows the group out, careful to make sure everyone goes before him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The discipline of Bahamut is one of Life after all. And what’s more lively than making more life?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The fire crackles as the five sit around it.  The two women helpers get Vam comfortable and Heston brings bowls of thick venison stew and fresh bread.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Ma)ouelue is in high spirits right now, not jubilant, but excited, envigorated with purpose and comradely. (S)he gathers everyone around the hearth and begins to speak to the group in a dramatic and hushed whisper. Speech becomes a song of love and devotion. A condemnation for the masses who have, for honesty, been asked for apology by those who enjoy the silence. Those who wear guilt like shackles on their feet. A halo in reverse.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(S)he proffers a blank page of her spellbook-cum-tome of faith.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here, I stand, with the book in my hand, truth on my side. I will not substitute blindness for kindness. If anyone can smell a lie, let the accusations fly, but time after time I feel elation...hiiiigh...at the personal faith that I can feel reach out from each of you. Never again is what we swore the time before this madness happened again. Let us not be hos to these pimpfs! Reach out! Touch faith! Arise warriors of the light!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>(Ma)ouelue’s transformation has elicited a sped-up style.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They all are on fire with the words.  Heston is physically on the edge of his seat, legs bouncing in anticipation of a fight.  Daran, calmer, shows it in his eyes.  Although outwardly calm and resolute, Ouelue sees a spark in the elf's eyes that probably hasn't been there for quite some time.  Vam is impressed, too, but he is more subdued.  Their host sits forward and wipes his mouth with a checked cloth.  "Those are some powerful, powerful words.  And we are all proud and excited to be behind you and yours, friend.  The thing is...  we just don't have the numbers.  Not here, at least.  The way I see it, we can call these fuckers out, storm the castle, ride in on white steeds, the whole fucking deal.  But they've got things I've only seen in my nightmares.  And by the wagon load, to boot.  Might be best to take the word on the road, see what help we can drum up in, say, Neverwinter?  Or even Waterdeep?  Hell, Silverymoon might even have a hundred strong to ride with us, wipe the shits out in one go?  Unless you have a different idea already?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We’ve a man on the inside.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam studies the wizards face for a long moment.  The others look tensely at each other.  Vam says, "Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye. He is within.” (S)he looks long in Vam’s eyes. </p><p>“How many are loyal to us in Oakhurst?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He swallows, wipes his mouth again, shakes his head.  "I don't think you understand, son.  There is no more Oakhurst."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Kirra, Denson, Saynea?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Surely they are not <i>all</i> gone!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam lowers his eyes, looking simultaneously very sad and very old.  "I didn't see what happened to Kirra.  Denson fell.  Saynea was taken back to their camp, wherever that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Only two buildings are fully intact from the burnings - the tavern and the shrine."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ilmater...I wonder what became of the healer.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't know that I ever saw what happened to her in all the craziness.  Just noticed the place was untouched.  Must have suffered enough, eh?"  He chuckles, somberly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell you what, though... if I get another round of healing, I might be able to walk through what's left with you, see what we're working with?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye Vam. All together now?” He looks at the other two healers in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>(Ma)ouelue lets their glamour flicker, eyeing the others in anticipation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue and Daran hover around the man, while Bellatrix kneels at his feet.  They all lay hands and a golden glow surrounds Vam.  As the glow fades, the two women helpers gasp as a whole and hale Vam stands amidst his co-horts.</p><p>He looks at his arms and body.  Then he removes the bandage from his face.  Scars are still there, creasing his dark brown skin.  And the eye is still cloudy, not fully healed.  Maybe it never will be.  But the man standing in front of Ouelue and Daran smiles.</p><p>"Now...  well, then."  Wetness lines the bottom of his eyes as he looks to his friends with pure thanks.  "Much obliged.  All of you.  Thank you."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Vam...I am only repaying a debt that was already owed. You helped me and my <i>missing</i> friend Dieter in a time of need. We formed an alliance that day, and <i>one that I aim to keep alive!</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Who here will swear fealty to the cause of righteousness and the pursuit of a new valor in these lands!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston steps forward, but then looks awkward.  "I... uh...  I will.  I don't have any weapons or anything.  Not sure how exactly to swear fealty.  But I'm with you guys!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As am I," says Vam, smiling at the young ranch-hand.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I believe your cause is just, wizard.  As long as you will have me by your sides, I will fight."  Bellatrix's eyes sheen over quickly with a green flash.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your will is all that is needed my good men and women, and...both...!" </p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray let us each ready ourselves for the next push at hand. We leave in two hours."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam motions to Heston, and they take their leave out the back doors.  Bellatrix goes back to the fire, meditating.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The elf's illusion fades as he sits there in the warmth of the ranch. He comes out of his short reverie and walks out the back door and over to the nearest paddock, seeing what has become of the animals under Vam's care.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He cast his gaze around for Vam as he strolls over the lands, hoping to have a private word.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lands are sparse now.  The rain has abated enough to show a muddy tract of land devoid of crops, a strange sight to be sure as last you saw it was flush and growing well.   Vam and Heston are in the barn's hayloft, you heard some muffled noises and talking.  There are couple horses, one of which you do recognize as the one Dieter took along on the start of the trek.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The elven reverie has tempered some of the flame that had run so hot at the past meeting and Maouelue pauses at the door to the barn and knocks on the doorframe deferentially.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I beg your pardon, friends."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I came to check on the horses. I see one of those you lent us has returned...what news of its mate?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam peeks his head down.  "Unfortunately only this one came back.  Heston's got something interesting up here, if you want to check it out.  Not sure what to make of it, but you might."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I'm sorry to hear that. A thousand apologies for the loss. She was a good steed for her part. We did not...intend to be underground so long..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue ascends into the hayloft to investigate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, don't worry about it," he offers you a hand up to the loft.  "Most of the horses we have here are wild, or were at one point.  Heston here is a wizard with calming them, tempering them for farm work.  Other things happening right now, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the Dragon Mage steps up into the loft, he sees Heston sitting on a small stool next to an old chest.  Vam follows over and says, "Hes says it's an old family heirloom.  Haven't seen any heirloom like this, though.  What do you make of it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston holds out a shaped, twisted piece of metal.  Long cylinders connect and protrude from a steel body.  The end curves down into a handle of sorts, on which some sort of bone or horn has been layered.  Heston says, "Was my pa's.  Only ever seen him use it once.  He gave me the name of a guy that can help fix it, if I ever needed it, but he's way out in the North territories.  Never ha much use for it.  Until now, that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Indeed this is an interesting trinket."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He undoes a clasp, and a wide cylinder ops out.  It spins easily, showing chambers around the main cylinder.  Six, exactly.  "Pa taught me how to keep it oiled.  It sends these things whizzing like you wouldn't believe!"  He holds out rounded, tube-like projectiles, similar to elongated versions of Maouelue's frosted balls.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Think it'll help?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Keep that thing steady there lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue reaches out for one of the projectiles, "...er, may I?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston readily hands Maouelue all of the items.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue inspects the cylindrical item and the elongated metal items. He chuckles mildly, thinking of the look on Dieter's face the first time he saw the new metal-clad zealous look. A mixture of dumbstruck horror and awe and confusion all grappling with the sense of camaraderie. The muscular contortions on the already shape-shifted visage were such as pleasant plethora of hilarity.</p><p></p><p>Here, holding this new metal monstrosity in his hands, he feels a pang of guilt holding the item and so sets it down carefully. He turns a professional eye to it instead, taking in its design and metalworkings.</p><p></p><p>"Was this everything in that chest there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Just some family memories.  Clothes and mementos.  But I thought I could carry that, in case it might come in handy.  Hate to be unarmed, and I'm really no good with swords or bows," says Heston.  Vam chuckles, starts down the ladder.  "Well, as long as we're getting things together, I think I'll run by the iron works, see what's salvageable."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You take good care of that weapon Heston, and if you need company up North some day, I'll see it done."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage lays a warm hand on Heston's right shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The lord of life and light guide your aim freind."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston looks up at the wizard, beaming.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Now, tell me, whatever came of the <i>rest</i> of those serpentine reagents we gave you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Was there enough left over for the pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I do so desperately want to to deliver them to dieter and don't dare disappoint."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston guffaws as only a cowboy can.  "Sure, absolutely!  Forgot all about them in the commotion.  See here," and he takes you down the ladder into a corner of the barn set up as a makeshift tannery.  They are all as you requested, all fit to size.  They're extremely supple, too.  The craftsmanship is really top notch.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Ah perfect, Dieter'll love these. He's been jealous of my hat, armor, and bracers since the vault to be honest..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Won't say nothin' about it mind, but I see him sneaking glances."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"But...I might just keep the hat..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston says, "Now, here's something I though would be handy."  He shows off the bracers, saying, "There's a small area here for a dagger or small knife, but when there's nothing in there, because of the scales, it's seamless."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Aye, indeed! My man Dieter will find that <i>most</i> intriguing, if I've been following his passions precisely of late!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you for the beautiful work. We set up a bit of a forge ourselves down under as a matter of fact. If we get out the other side of this, might be we should make a bit of a go at it, after we learn a bit more up in the Northern reaches that is."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He pats your shoulder.  "If we get through what's next, just might hold you to that."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage returns a wry smile and a few crow's feet crinkle in the corner of his starry eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Alright now, let's round up the crew and hit the road. What say we ready a few steeds for our needs?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'll get right on that.  Four gonna work?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's bring five. Just in case Dieter is in rougher shape than we might expect. Reckon we could keep a fifth in tow?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around at the stables, scratching his chin.  "Lemme see what I can round up.  Meet you back here in a few."  He makes haste out of the barn.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue takes a beat and looks around at one of the last remnants of the Oakhurst he was just beginning to know and love. Here where they held that fateful council...What a mess! What impetuous hubris. The dark currents run deep and they are not easily displaced. One would do well to remember this going forward.</p><p></p><p>He makes for the main building and comes into Bellatrix's view checking on her reverie.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well, let's just say I've got a fancy new hat!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He trades the Frostbitten Helm for the supplely-scaled, pointed had.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Our steeds arrive and we are off to put this dread pattern right!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Turning from the fire, she gives the wizard a deep look.  Without knowing her, some would say it was a dark, foreboding gesture.  Knowing who she is... it might still be foreboding, but Maouelue knows it as a introspective look.  She purses her lips, goes into her pack.  "Would you allow me an... insight?  Into our upcoming venture?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue slows his gusto replies reverently, “Of course, anything.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What would you ask of me?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Often people are scared of that which they cannot see, hear, physically interact with.  You and I know, however, that there is a weave to the world that is unseen, yet bonds everything together.  There are ways to manipulate this weave.  But for every action, there is a reaction.  Every now and again, I like to try and see the eventuality of those actions and reactions.  I give you the choice - rune, card, or dice?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Rune.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>h!rune</p></div>
<div class="character-5"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mysterious woman smirks a little at the choice.  She reaches into her pack, closes her eyes, rummages more.  Then, slowly, she brings her closed fist out of the bag.  </p><p>"Runes help us connect with the elements.  They are an intimate connection to our inner being.  My runes have been with me for a very long time, since I was a child.  The longer you have a connection with them, and the closer they are to the body in that time, the more accurate they can be."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With that, she opens her hand.  The rune that looks back at you is carved into smooth, sanded bone.  The carved section is black, contrasting greatly against the bleached white of the bone.  Bellatrix's smile fades as she looks at the symbol.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“This symbol is out of balance.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She peers at you and squints. "You've recently found a new deity.   But that deity has some connection to the horrors you've faced.  Even with the heightened piety, or maybe because of it, you are more of a target than ever before.  Not just by the forces you seek out.  Things move in the shadows, to compel you off of your path.  Or maybe onto the correct one?  Maouelue, be wary of going farther away or closer to your patron.  You are on a shield balanced atop a sword.  One slight move any way might plunge you into chaos."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue listens to the words and stares at the symbol as if in a trance. He moves his right hand over the top of the rune and pulls his water skin out with his left. He pours a few drops into the weave his other hand is making above the rune and thin, beaded arcs of water begin to form. The arcs spiral and conform into a column of circles, spinning about a vertical axis. The wizard’s left hand stows the skin and comes over top of the cylinder, pressing downward and spinning counterclockwise. Six beaded rings of water spread out around a central one, mimicking the pattern of the rune below. This form hovers for a few moments and Maouelue’s hands come to a rest. He speaks an elven word and a spire begins to coalesce out of the vapors surrounding the sigil. At first it appears to run across the depth of the pattern, but then turns and reveals the three spread legs from below, now making a facsimile of the rune. Hovering there for a moment, another word is uttered and the spindle-legged stalk begins to tilt vertically making a three dimensional spire held by a tripod of feet. The feet connect at the alternating intersections of the inner circle with the outer.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue’s eyes shine bright blue. It almost seems as if the Light comes from behind him and through him into the watery symbol as a cold radiance comes and freezes the re-balanced rune in place. He raises his gaze toward Bellatrix and sets the structure atop her heirloom rune.</p><p></p><p>“We must approach the old conflict with new dimensions, if we are to find balance.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Belltrix's smile returns as Maouelue reinterprets her reading.  "Wisdom is often found throughout dimensions.  If one can only see what needs to be seen when they need to see it."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let us hope both our sight and our hearts find the right path through the miasma that awaits. I’ll be glad to have you by my side dear lady.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Deleted counter Inspiration12.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue holds Trix’s gaze awhile then nods and gestures onward. “If we are to regain our balance, we must indeed establish our pillars in the area. Let us find Vam and Heston and discuss our strategy.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods, gets up from the fireplace to watch out the window.  The rain has stopped, an eerie fog has set upon the town.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue stays his advance and turns to regard the scene with Trix. “A dire scape to be certain... but come now, we will make our own omens on the road.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her lips purse.  She waits for Maouelue to lead the way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leads out through the moist land to the edge of the paddock to meet with the rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mist slowly rises all around like steam from a lake.  It gives the world an ominous feel.  Dark clouds above, still threatening a downpour, mixed with the haze sets a macabre scene.  A howl can be heard in the distant forest.  Vam and Heston are in the barn, saddling and settling the horses.  Vam waves to the two of you as you enter.  Daran is walking around, inspecting the horses, whispering to them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ho there. Many thanks for the horses and bridling. My friends, we must make haste to our next destination, yet we must be firm in our conviction. The forces that move, as Vam said, are vile, powerful, and far reaching. We would do well to set up a network around the Neverwinter. I have seen a spire of three converging and ascending upwards, an omen that I take at this moment as a guide to our cause. Let us create a network across Neverwinter, Longsaddle, and Luskan. We will seek information in subtle ways throughout these towns. Lie low and strengthen our position. There is no telling where Dieter may be at this moment. I know this in my heart now. I must not let zeal overtake clarity of mind. Pray, what would each of you say to this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The four look between themselves.  They seem to be testing the waters, see who is going to take over the second-in-command role, all seemingly deferring to each other.  Vam nods, looks at Heston.  Heston nods, looks between Vam and the others.  Daran looks pensive.  Bellatrix turns her keen eye to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What you say is very wise.  The two towns of Longsaddle and Neverwinter will have sympathetic ears.  Luskan, I fear...  That might be war on a second front we do not have the ability for.  It all depends on our quarry.  If it be Dieter, then I offer to scry to locate him.  If our goal is to garner troops and wage battle on the Runemark's men, then cavalry is needed.  We can do both, but then delegation is the key."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What contacts have you men in any of the nearby towns? Do we have any friends or advantages in Longsaddle? If what you say about Luskan is true, then it's either East and South, or make our way through the North Neverwinter Wood and head for the coast."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When you mention Neverwinter Woods, you see Daran get very uncomfortable.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks uncomfortable when the Wood is mentioned.   He involuntarily clutches at a chain around his chest and takes a step backwards.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston shrugs.  "I don't really have any contacts or anything.  Especially nearby.  I can ride and check in with the powers-that-be in Longsaddle, though.  Been there a handful of times."</p><p>Vam says, "I have a few merchant contacts in both places.  I can take whomever to check into what either can help with."</p><p>Bellatrix just puts her head down and shakes it.</p><p>Daran, speaking softly, says, "Neverwinter Woods is my home.  I can ensure anyone who travels through will be safe."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell, accept a copy of Heston? (Type yes/no)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Transfer not confirmed, aborting.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue eyes the half-elf for a long beat. “Thank you Daran. Is there aught else you would tell us about the Wood? What of your people there?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks at the ground for a few beats, the awkward silence growing.  Finally he looks up, directly into Maouelue's eyes, and says, "None of my people there any longer.  There are... places we should avoid, and I can help you with that.  The safest route is around, but if there is a need to go through, I can help.  All manners of things are drawn to the woods."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I...I am sorry dear Daran. I can see there is great pain this causes you. I will pry no further.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I think we would do well not to fracture our fellowship into too many groups. I am of a mind to have those that would go to Longsaddle establish a foothold in the community. I shall lead a party into Neverwinter. I will not ask any of you to brave this with me, but would welcome any support may it be forthcoming.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Daran, there may not be need to delve too far into the Forest, but I would appreciate its cover rather than the suspicion and exposure of the road. I will follow your lead in your domain.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He nods.  But you can tell he's still holding something back.   The rest of the group seem bolstered by the fact they won't be individually left alone on a task.  Welcoming the challenge, Van says, "I can take Heston with me to Longsaddle.  We can round up some folks and then meet back here?  Or I can just ride with them to Neverwinter and we can march from there, too.  Your call, Mao."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>@Russell, accept a copy of Heston? (Type yes/no)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>yes</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Copied Heston to Maouelue/Dieter's storage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Good, good. I would have you stay in Longsaddle for the time being. If you are able, send word ahead to anyone who may be friends to our cause in Neverwinter. Vam you mentioned you know a few merchants. Can we trust anyone to give us a place to lay low when we get there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You'll be faster than anyone or anything I can send along.  But when you get to Neverwinter you can check in with Liset Cheldar.  She owns the Moonstone Inn, in the Protector's Enclave.  She'll be able to put you up and find things you need.  Might even introduce you to the Lord Protector hisself!  He'd be able to get a force to be reckoned with, being on the Alliance and all!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"That would be welcome indeed. We might do well to gain such an ally in our cause. Where should we send word to reach you to let you know of our arrival?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix breaks in and says, softly, "I may be able to help with that.  If there shall be two groups, this method of communication will suffice."  She pulls two stones out of her pack.  A sigil it etched into each stone, the same on both.  She hands one to Vam, then one to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"These are sending stones.  They carry a message only to the other, and it can only be sent or retrieved if the bearer or sender speaks the correct word."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue inspects the stones intently. "Dear me! Dieter has a set just like these! I don't think we rightly knew their use or we would be in a hell of a lot better spot right now!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If only we could reach him."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The glow in Maouelue's eyes dims considerably at the thought of his missing friend.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stares at Maouelue.  "To send or receive, the word is <i>vuorl</i>."  She puts a hand in Maouelue's.  "We must stop by my mirror before we travel to Neverwinter."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You will ride with us then, my lady?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will.  But not before I scry for Dieter."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Yes, I would very much love to see what we can of him. Any information we can gain of his status will be of immense service. Vam, Heston, Daran, you should come too. We had all best be informed. Let us to this at once."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All nod in agreement, saddle up, and are ready to go.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trip is quick, seeing as how this time you have Bellatrix in the lead.  She welcomes all into her home, unveils the mirror, and stands before it pensively.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue is caught by a wave of nostalgia and reminiscence of how simple things had seemed back when they were first here.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She wrings her hands, then takes a deep breath.  She places her hand on the mirror's surface.  The reflection fades to black, grey smoke swirls, coalesces.  Colors appear, render into shapes.  The forms take on the visage of Dieter and another man, very well known to Maouelue.  The man is sitting in a cell, looking at Dieter occasionally.  Dieter is unconscious in the bed next to him.  Another form can be seen hazily in a third bed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix, her hands on both sides of the mirror now, knuckles white, focuses her gaze more.  The picture recedes out of the door, up hallways, through walls.  It takes some time, but after a few beats, a citadel comes into view.  It's dark stairs lead to a spired set of towers, all decrepit and crumbling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the picture moves farther out, the darkness can be seen as the bottom of a chasm.  The chasm, or maybe a dark gorge, cuts a wide path.  As the mirror's picture continues to pan out, the gorge ends and an immense rock wall goes up, up, up, cresting at the rim of a crater, easing down into a caldera of a volcano.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Red drops hit the floor in front of the mirror.  Bellatrix sways as the grey mist comes back to the mirror.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Bellatrix? My lady, are you unwell? What is it? What has happened?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She swoons, slipping to the ground.  (Dex save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue puts a hand on the witch's shoulder, but she slumps away.  Vam and Daran catch her before she hits the ground.  They bring her to a ramshackle couch and lie her down.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood is running from each nostril in small rivulets, her eyes flutter.  Her mouth is moving, but there is no sound coming out.   (Medicine check for more info!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage begins to perform a few preliminary clerical ministrations to determine Trix’s condition.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She doesn't seem to be in any pain.  She's more than likely highly exerted herself from the scry.  It doesn't typically happen, but there are occasions where this might occur.  Normal healing should help her.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are a few more stoppered potions of healing on her herbalism table.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue moves to take a potion of healing, then unstoppers it and dabs a few drops around Bellatrix’s lips, then pours a cursory few drops down her gullet.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blood dries and Bellatrix comes to, groggily.  "I'm...  sorry.  The larger view must have taken more out of me than I imagined.  Did any of you recognize the area?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran, Vam, and Maouelue all nod their heads.  Heston and Bellatrix look at each expectantly.  Vam clears his throat and begins, "Uh...  It might be kinda tough to get to him, unless anyone else knows more about it.  I saw Mount Hotenow, and the gorge that peels off to the East is where the tower-thing is.  All I can think of - and mind you, this is just a terror-tale to scare kids - it that the place we saw was the Sunless Citadel."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston gives a low whistle and slumps back in a chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran nods, somberly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks from one to the other. He has been underground enough to know what fel things reside in the sunless places of these parts. </p><p>“Please Vam, go on. I think, under the circumstances, that no ‘terror-tale’ would be too unbelievable. I saw one of those madmen with mine own eyes animating an abomination. Oh there are dark magicks indeed at work here.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ayuh," he starts, tilting his hat back and looking grave.  "Legend says there is a dragon that keeps the fires of Mount Hotenow going.  An ancient red dragon, who constantly bathes in the blood of the world..  One day, a conqueror built a tower along the river flowing past the volcano.  The conqueror had heard the rumors and dug straight down into the land to make a path underneath Hotenow so as to directly confront the dragon.  A massive eruption took place after this path was made, and the wonderous tower the conqueror had constructed slid into the rift, never to be seen again.  Crazy story, huh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Crazy....You mean to say the Citadel fell <i>into</i> the breach?... Dieter and I found a vast crevasse underground just before...just...”, He stifles a croaky breath. “...Just before he was taken.” The memory of building the forge, the weight of his armor relieved, the shared sweat and laughs and discovery of the joys of making...it all washes over Maouelue like a beam of starlight refracting off his sword into a million colors, blinding him with chromatic grief. </p><p></p><p>“Yes...he is there. I know it in my heart. Daran, do you remember where you found me?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It all makes so much sense now. The snakes tunnels in Oakhurst, the Muhlen vault, the abyssal ravine... <i>That’s</i> how they’ve remained unseen. <i>That’s</i> how they are moving in the shadows. Sunless indeed. If this is the case...pray, perhaps we should reconsider our apprehension of the matter...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Perhaps...we needn’t stray so far afield after all. Perhaps we have all we need right here. Stay awhile and listen...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They lean in to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Dragon Mage solemnly doffs The Frostbitten Helm and places it on the floor. Next he silently slings the Shield of Disruption off his back and places it to the right and under the Helm. The Sword of the Mists and its scabbard come next, and now the outline of a warrior is beginning to take form. The Giantess Bracers come next and the elven wizard rubs at his wrists as they do, the skin puffy and pale with long suppression. Having donned the splint previously for ease of movement and discretion of sound, he goes over to his Bag of Holding™️ and pulls out the previously animated plate mail from Mulhen’s vault and places it in the center of the form. Lastly, he pulls out a serpentine amulet and a tattered book, <i>The Barbarian’s Wind</i>. These he places directly in front of Bellatrix and his eyes, who have been pointedly focused on the assembly until this point, meet hers in a somber stare.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here lie the relics of Lord Muhlen. He kept more than secrets in those halls. The Vault we found was surrounded by undead and grave warnings. Here lie the heirloom treasures of his delving. He sought deep, deep beneath even the lowest foundation of his haunt. The trap leading below the vault carried us into vast caverns of mystery. The book you see here was a gift, you see... A relic left to his <i>worthiest</i> of offspring, his...’dearest daughter.’ </p><p></p><p>As fate would have it, we met the man you saw there...”, He points to the scrying lens, “...in the mirror. That man gave us aid in the direst of circumstance. He saved and healed us when all else would have failed. With us, he traveled deeper intro the tunnels, showing us the way to many curiosities. <i>He seemed to know the tunnels in a way.</i> Frumious, or Frume as he would have us call him, led us to the first of many serpentine artifacts we would find down there. Altars and reliefs of ancient Naga rituals, dark sacrifice, a multi-headed dragon laying waste a continent...</p><p></p><p>As it turns out, some waste was laid on our behalf as well. You see, the serpents...well, three of them stood in this very room the last time we met. Three that have been lain low by our hands. Mine, Dieter’s, Frume’s and...” He stops a moment to consider the curiosity of the mirror men, the Henchys. Just how did they fit into all this? Should he even mention them? “...and some...I’m not quite sure how to explain it, but some magical-summonings-cum-acquaintances-cum-cohort? You see we found this mirror back when we first went seeking Douglas....” Maouleue takes a beat and surveys his audience. “...ah, never mind all that. Suffice it to say the Muhlen sisters <i>and their brother</i> are no more. Just how they tie into the Runmark’s machinations though, I am not yet sure. Please, friends of the light, understand this one last thing, the very place we finally surfaced was right atop a bottomless chasm underground.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It would seem where once we were saved by the light, we may now need descend into darkness in order to restore balance to these lands and to the lives of all who tread near this corruption.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Eyes go wide.  Looks pass between everyone.  They look to the items, then Maouelue, then each other.  All in silence.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, Vam breaks the quiet, saying, "Now, wait a minute.  If you're saying this citadel...  you've possibly been in?  Or near?  Then...  the rest could be true, too?"   He scratches his stubble.  "And what about the Runemark's forces?  If they're using that thing as a base of operations or something, well...  what else could they be harboring down in the depths?  We might have a difficult time taking down a human army.  But what if...?"  His voice fades as the possibilities surround the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“It may be that a small band such as ourselves, moving quietly and unseen could be the best chance at taking them down. They won’t expect an attack from within, and if I were a betting elf, I’d say they won’t expect me to go back down in a hurry... Nevertheless, we should take caution. If only there were some way to draw out their forces, draw any of the guard away from the halls within...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix starts at this last from Maouelue.  "But, isn't that what we are proposing already?  Bringing a force in front of them, drawing them out?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I must admit, I am torn. If this is indeed the place, then I fear it will only grow stronger with every passing moment. What of magical means? Could we not cause some sort of disturbance of another sort? One that does not risk the will and loyalty of others? And most importantly, one that does not take so much to time! To think, that I was to lead us <i>away</i> from the place! No, I fear if our man is caught in that dread place, I dare not delay any longer, lest all hope be lost for his redemption.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group ponders.  Bellatrix sits up on her couch, Vam paces near the entryway.  Heston is meandering, taking in the strange ambience of the witch's home.  Daran sits on a side chair, eyes closed, deep in thought.  Worry lines wrinkle his usually serene face.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seconds turn to minutes.  The silence, and worry, deepens.  Vam starts to say something, then shakes his head and stops.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, there is a soft knocking at the front door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Lightning hits, thunder rolls, outlining the doorway with an electric white light.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks up, peers around the room at the others.  Saying, "Excuse me," she gets up and heads toward the entry.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She grips the handle, and swings the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another strike of lightning outlines a hunched figure.  When the color comes back to the world, the group sees an old, grey-haired woman, wearing worn travelling clothes and carrying a carpet bag over a forearm.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix gasps.  "Sister?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p><pre><code> </code></pre></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The blue glow permeates everything.  A pulse beats, intensifying the miasma around Dieter.  He cannot see or feel anything except for his own consciousness within the glowing blue-grey fog.  </p><p></p><p>A white light descends from above.  It is small, even as it gets closer to Dieter it doesn’t grow at all.  This silver-white ball of light stops what seems like inches from the druid, and words emanate in the void.  “Thank you for your trust, Druid.  I fear I may have inadvertently scarred your friend as well.  I will try to make this as brief as I can.”  The ball of light morphs into the visage of a wizened man.  All of his features are tinged blue, but Dieter gets the sense that he is an old human, and his robes suggest a wizard or scholar of the arcane.  </p><p></p><p>“My name is Lord Alezander Muhlen.  I have been entombed in this… place for many decades.  Originally I had heard rumors that this place was the center of Netherese lore.  Upon my arrival, I found illithids making this their base and… reaping the legends of our forefathers.  To my great consternation, they were much more powerful that I could have imagined.  They captured me, tortured me for information.  Finally, they entombed my body in one of their stasis-pods.  Possibly for further experimentation.  You need to free me.  I am lost in here.  However, I can give you a general direction to where I am. Follow the light I can provide, be wary of the illithid warriors, and we will stop their foul plot upon our lands!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"One -I am both.  A bargain was made a very long time ago with the forefathers of our forefathers.  In return, I was to see their glorious light brought back from the brink of annihilation and render up unto them the dregs of this world.  They were to reign again, and I was to be their ambassador.  It may still be, yet.  The torch has been passed, as they so colloquially say.  The time may yet come to fulfill the terms of our agreement.  The Great World Serpent may yet draw breath upon the Material Plane.  And, if it does so, all humanity will fall under their carnage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Two - I <i>am</i> the Runemark.  Or at least, I was.  My death brought upon a great many changes, one of which is the transference of title.  The Runemark name has been handed down from generation to generation, starting centuries back.  My ancestors were sailors, and went across the great ocean to learn the secrets of the Runes from the Giants.  No human had ever or <i>has</i> ever done this, and we were able to grow in power and prestige because of it.  When a Runemark dies, the title and powers are passed down to their kin.  The tricky part is, one can never tell who will be the recipient.  It's not always the eldest, or even part of the direct family.  Bastards have been known to take up the mantle.  It has even driven a few mad when they've received their newly-redeemed gifts.  Needless to say, though, if I <i>were</i> to come back, I fully expect my powers to return as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Three..." He chuckles.  "I'm guessing since you even <i>have</i> to ask me the question, you aren't up on your dragon lore.  Let me enlighten you, Druid.  Tiamat is the world breaker, according to legend.  She, being of five heads of every chromatic color, resides in the Nine Hells.  Since you do not know of her, I assume as well that the Cult of the Dragon has not yet unleashed her fury.  According to the prophecy, there will be one who is able to bring together the elements needed to call forth the Dragon Queen, ultimately starting the Last War - dragons versus the rest of humanity.  It seems there are many old ones who believe this land to be theirs, and will stop at nothing to see it back in their possession.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The only thing to do is to release me from my prison.  I, and only I, can right what the illithids and the Dragon Cult are doing, so all Nine Hells don't erupt.  I know it's trading one type of fate for another, but who knows...  maybe there is a way to appease the Naga and not have them usurp Faerun.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter speaks to the wizard, demanding answers, he notices the wizard morph.  As the wizard comes back to his human form, for a moment, Dieter saw a familiar face.  For the briefest of moments, Frume was looking back at him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Thoughts race through Dieter’s mind. He must make up his mind quickly, but this? What could have prepared him for this? Should he save this demon-man and risk the consequences of his resurrection, or allow the dark forces at work to continue their machinations? </p><p></p><p><i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend they say, but what if my friend may also be my fiend...? And what of Frume, is not this shadow also the enemy of my friend? Alas there is no time for deep rumination, but certainly any advantage that may be taken over my pursuers must be taken... I must decide...</i></p><p></p><p>He considers a long as he can, then utters, </p><p></p><p>“Lord Muhlen, you are keen to sense the dichotomy of my dilemma. I offer you this; I will free you as penance for your daughters untimely end at our hands. From there, let us unite in the felling of these dread usurpers. Time will tell if we can be allied, but there is no doubt we have much to gain from each other if so. I’ll take my chances with that, but please, release Frumious. Though his motivations be fraught, his heart be true. Aye, man-of-many-faces-and-names, I will free you. Pray, it doesn’t take me to mine own doom.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The apparition looks puzzled, scratches his beard, whispers something under his breath.  (Perception to pick it up!)</p><p>He then looks at Dieter, serious.  "You have no hope of fighting these illithids without aid.  Mind flayers are known not only to be cunning but to also possess powers unknown to the arcanists of our time.  I will help you defeat these fiends, but the aid I can give you lies behind the closed doors that have stymied you.  The answer you seek lie in an ancient language, but it is not Netherese.  Only in my death have I discovered the truth.  They are illithid shrines.  The west door you may enter with the word <i>Sungovall</i>.  The south may be entered with the word <i>Svankigare</i>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"In these halls you may find objects of great power, but remember, do not lose yourself in the strength of these items.  Once you have braved the trials to receive these, follow the east past from this hall.  The light I can provide will guide you.  But beware, there are monsters up ahead.  After you defeat the menace, you'll find my tomb.  I will appear to you there and help you continue your quest."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I have no trust for one who whispers secrets to someone unknown in my presence. Have out with it or stay entombed for eternity. Your mutterings betray you, fiend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard smiles.  "Not at all.  It is you, I fear, who are betrayed, my young Druid.  I was merely...  surprised.  About why my son wouldn't tell you his real name."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“For one in such need of mine aid, thou woulds’t do well to speak plainly. Your riddles serve neither cause.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No riddles here.  I gave you the information you need to get through the doors.  Finding my body and resurrecting me is in both our interest.  Then I will be able to show you a way out of this juggernaut.  We are done here.  Act in any way you see fit."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And in a wisp of blue-grey smoke, the void collapses in on itself.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is standing where he was last, in the vast, cold room with the banners, the columns, and a very confused Frume.  He was just grasping air a second ago, now his hand is grabbing your leg.  His mouth hangs agape, trying to piece things together.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dastardly Demon....”, Dieter spits.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Riddles encased in a labyrinth entombed in a mystery!”, The disgusted druid deliberates.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As his sight comes back to, he lays eyes on Frume and thinks for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wwww...  What happened??  Did you...  go somewhere?  You just flashed!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I...had a vision of a way out though...it will not be simple.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks worried.  "Aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye. What of you? You seem to have taken quite a shock yourself? What was it happened to you?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I'm sobered up after that light came down and flashed on you!  Thought you were going to be spirited away or summat..."  He takes a deep breath, trying to center himself.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ah! I’m sure you are, I’m sure you are friend, and for that I am grateful.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes a beat...”Frume, this may seem odd, but I’m fearful we could be in for a fair amount of trouble before we make it out of here. You have been so great a companion, I am embarrassed not to have asked you more about yourself. Hells! I don’t even know your last name, ha! Pray, let us become better acquainted.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’ll start. My full name is Dieter Deleter, druid of the coast. I come from the sword coast on an island just west of the Trollbark Forest. My family name is actually De Liter, but after....after the tragedy, I was banished and branded Deleter until I return in with my honor and receive absolution.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter starts speaking, talking of surnames and histories, the druid sees Frume start to close off, slightly.  Something in his eyes gives Dieter that there is something there that makes Frume conflicted.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah, partly my fault, I guess.  Truly well met, Dieter.  I'm actually from around the area.  Lived close to Oakhurst all my life.  My last name..  is Bandersnatch.  Family name after a great-great ancestor slayed an enormous beast from the Abyss.  I'm sorry to hear of the tragedy in your history, I truly am.  After all you've done, would you not be able to return redeemed now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is skeptical.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ah! You’re from around Oakhurst? Where did you live?  In the hills? By the river? A big house outside of town?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The last line gets him.  His eyes go wide and he looks down at his feet.  Slowly, he says, "What kind of vision did you have there, friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Don’t mean to gloss over the bit about the Abyssal beast as well, that sounded fierce!”...”Wait, oh what’s that? Didn’t catch you there...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Head still down, eyes still downcast, he turns and walks toward the S door.  He starts speaking very heavily, as if the words cause him great pain and are being wrenched from him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"My first explanation to you was a bunch of lies, I was never the hero of a town nor did I lose everything in a fire.  Well... not until recently.  You and Maouelue burned down my family home, so technically, I guess my first statement did come to pass...  in a matter of speaking."  He looks up at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't get me wrong, if I coulda burned the fuckin' place to the ground before, I would 'ave!  My real name is Jaecob Muhlen.  I'm one of several middle sons of the Muhlen throng.  And," his eyes grow sorrowful, "I'm the Runemark."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He chuckles.  "Although, our youngest wouldn't have you believe it.  Wilm always coveted our father's power and influence.  He was always searching after the next legacy for the Muhlen name.  Problem is, this gift or curse or whatever-the-hell it is that our family has...  it doesn't exactly follow a pattern.  The eldest heir doesn't always get it.  Nor does the most sane.  I actually received it fairly young.  And I tried to give it back, I tried to rectify the fucking situation.  But all to naught, as it seems.  Never found the Giant's lands, never really even crossed the Trackless Sea.  Got stranded out on an island, pirates picked me up.  To get away, I told them..." He starts laughing in earnest, now, "Told 'em that I could turn silver to gold!  Told them I could increase their coffers with a single mark!!  They had me prove it, and they let me live.  Pieces of shite, they all were.  Dropped me in the middle of Luskan for dead.  Well...  well, you wanted to hear my history.  That's just some of the sordid details.  What else did this vision tell you?  Am I getting it all right so far?"  He leans against a wall and slides down to sitting, head in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Heh, and there we have it at last. Don’t worry Fru– Jaecob, we all have our demons, our skeletons in the sea. The truth will heal in all this and now it is my turn. Alezander...that was your father’s name, yes? It was he I met in the light-of-the-dark. He told me of the secret family history. He railed against the illithid usurpers that have taken this hold. And lastly he...he implored me to set him free...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume/Jaecob immediately looks up at you, fear straining his face as you say this last.  "Aye, that was my father's name.  And if he was fighting ill-thids, or whatever you said, so be it.  He can rot in Nessus for all I care, good riddance.  Whatever he <i>implored</i> you to do, though, forget about it.  He has a sweet tongue and a black heart.  Let it lie, friend.  Let's just concentrate on getting the hell outta this place.  Then, maybe, we can see to stopping my ignoble brother in his insane notion of 'conquering the world', aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, a silver tongue indeed he has, but not so easily are his deeds swept away into forgiveness. Even as he would seem to offer me aid in this endeavor, never an altruistic motive did I perceive. However, perhaps this new understanding gives you an opportunity for a greater redemption. These beast appear to have his soul captive, draining it for power and secrets. Mayhaps you could be the one to give him his final end? After all, the old scars don’t seem to have fully healed, let alone that new one he just opened in your mind. I won’t implore you, but if we are to survive this, we must speak plainly and true. What do you say?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"One in my mind...?"  Jaecob looks scared and his eyes go unfocused as he tries to reason this new bit of information.  Finally he says, "Aye, you're right.  I'm sorry, Dieter.  For my dishonesty and for my lack of courage.  I'll follow your lead on this, of course.  And if there be redemption here for any of us, let us find it, if only to go back to our families with heads held high."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Time for you to be rid of the ripples of this curse my good man, for you have suffered greatly and it seems little of it is of your doing. I accept your apology and I am sorry to have plumbed the depths of your spirit so, but it would seem, my hand was forced...as it so often has been these days. Come Jaecob, or Frume if you still prefer. We must all wear the name we choose even if we cannot run from that which we are given.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sidles up next to the melancholy man and gestures to the door. “It is time to move on, friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Svankigare...</i>”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles, getting up from his sitting position.  "Thought it was a nice name, <i>Frumious Bandersnatch</i>!  Got it from a book in my father's study."  He laughs, in remembrance.</p><p></p><p>The word is uttered and stone grinds, the south door swinging open towards the two adventurers.  Beyond is a dimly lit room, the light a pinkish-purple, throbbing to an imaginary beat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the men enter, a strange feeling comes over them.  (Wisdom save, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A small pain, barely enough to register as a pain, arcs through their minds upon entering  (1 damage!  Smh.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sprawling room has a caved wall in the SW corner of the room, a strange stone door sits on a pedestal of sorts, with no form of handle again.  There is a small set of stairs on the E wall raising up to a offset room.  There are several tattered tents or makeshift shelters throughout.  All appear to be empty, at least from a cursory glance.  The pink-purple light is emanating from small braziers all over, at base of all of the walls.  There looks to be something inside the braziers, giving of the strobing glow.  They are not all in sync, however, making you feel a slight bit off balance.  Lastly, the duo notice standard wooden doors to the S and W, aside from to door in the curved wall jutting out.  (Perception or investiagtion on anything you want, just let me know what you're looking for/at!)...(and Roll20 is updated, too.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As Dieter walks slowly into the room he rubs at an itch on one of his temples. He takes a keen look at the brazier down to his left and makes a note to inspect the tents thoroughly afterward.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter scans a couple braziers close to him.  They seem to have oddly shapes crystals in them, again giving off light.  The tents have seen better days, although, that being said, they have more than likely been standing and decaying for quite some time.  Could be years to decades, it's hard to say.  The animal hide on them was cured, but they are still worn and threadbare.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter looks in a couple tents, he can see into one and traces of dried blood can be viewed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter looks goes about all of the tents looking inside each to see if they are empty and/or clean.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He turns his head as he passes back by the door and beckons Shelli to join.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli lets out a <i>"Mwaaap"</i> and squeezes through the doorway.  As the investiagtion continues, the tents look either picked over or very sparse.  There are remnants of fires here and there.  The one with the blood has a corner covered in it, splashing up on the leathers.  Nothing else can be discerned from the tents, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Jaecob, I must admit, my spirit and body are weary. The encounter with your father’s shade on top of all that led to this imprisonment has taken its toll. Pray, help me gather these crystals to put out the lights and let us take rest in these tents. Not the Pig and Falcon by a long shot, but better than being completely exposed as well. Shelli, we’ll rotate our guard and make sure you can rest too, poor thing.” He strokes a slimy stalk affectionately.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look like crystals to you, nothing more than that.  You pile them up in the tent, check and shut the doors to the best of your ability, and settle yourselves for a long rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men wake up to voices.  Inside their heads.  Not painful.  Not speaking to them, either.  </p><p><i>"...Have to make sure he doesn't wake, EVER..."</i></p><p><i>"Did you see where they went?..."</i></p><p><i>"... Should be ready by now...."</i></p><p><i>"...If this guys bosses me around one more time..."</i></p><p><i>"Brains...  brains...  BRAINS..."</i></p><p><i>"Keep them out.  Must keep them out!"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All of the words swirl together.  It doesn't even sound like many people, but the words ram into Jaecob and Dieter's minds without pause.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shelli cocks her head at the two men.  Jaecob puts his hands to his ears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The glowing crystals sparkle in the darkness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter raises himself slowly and begins to peer about the tent and then slowly outside the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tents are clear, as they were yesterday.  There is nothing that presents itself to either Dieter or Jaecob, but something does catch Muhlen's attention. He approaches the altar at the top of the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What is it Jaecob?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm not sure.  Looks expensive, though!"</p><p>As he slowly climbs the gradual steps, he points to a golden alms box underneath the altar table.  At opposite ends of the altar, two skulls of some lizard-like creature stare down at Jaecob as he climbs.  In the center of the table is an egg-shaped object atop a short pedestal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter climbs the steps and stands next to Jaecob. He peers at the object curiously, taking it in against all he has seen with the tapestries, reliefs, and of course his recent conversation with the spirit Lord.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what the iconography is meant for, but it is a brilliantly wrought piece.  Solid gold, with very intricate designs.  There is a lock on the front, looks like it would open like a typical chest.  (Perception for more of the area or investigation for traps/locks.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's locked but otherwise looks fine to Dieter!  (Sleight of hand for lockpicking, perception check for other things, or investigation if you want anything specific!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter is wary about the hidden potentials of the strange room and altar. He moves his body in a circular motion sending out radiating sparkles as he speakers the incantation searching for traces of magic here.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid gets a few <i>pings</i> from the spell.  There is a slight aura around the chest, abjuration magic.  The egg shape on the table has a very strange aura around it, you can't really tell the school of magic, though.  The door on the curved wall has an aura of abjuration magic.  The crystals are also giving off a strange vibe.  Not so much an aura, but something about them is on the cusp of magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The piece of metal Dieter finds bends and almost breaks off in the locking mechanism.  He's able to retract it.  Jacob hands you a pair of lockpicks, saying, "Here, these might work a bit better, aye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Thanks. I’ll give em a shot!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes the lockpicks and tries his hand at the chest again.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob watches as Dieter deftly delves into the locking mechanism again.  This time, with a few quick twists of his wrists, the lock <i>clicks</i> open, the latch kicks open in a rush.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A strange beating starts coming from the box.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob grabs his head, and immediately falls unconscious, slipping from the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a strange clicking mixed in with the beating now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter dives away to pick up Jaecob and pull him to the relative safety of a tent, watching the chest through the flap with a dreadful anticipation.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't tell what is wrong with Jaecob, but he infers that it's probably due to the unlocking of the chest.  The golden boon strands closed, with the beating and clicking still emanating from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes out his crossbow and fires a bolt a the lid of the chest trying to pry open the top from afar by pushing it up against its hinges.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few things happen simultaneously.  First, Dieter notices the top to the chest <i>bump</i> up.  Second, the druid hears a choking cough come from Jaecob.  Lastly, he sees the bolt <i>thunk</i> into the top of the chest, and it flies open...  revealing...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>OB1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (14) + 3 = <code>17</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The slime <i>flops</i> out of the chest with a sickening squelch.  An almost humanoid form appears within it as it sloughs its way down the steps towards Dieter and Jaecob.</p></div>
