<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dodgy place..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Best to keep moving."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agreed..." says Dieter as he notes the myriad exits to the room. "Best start to the left." he states as he proceeds to the Southwest door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He presses his ear lightly to the surface, wary of what the next foul challenge might be, before pushing the door open.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door swings wide and the hall you just came from stands empty.  A few doors down that hall are closed.  A trail of flail snail slime tracks from the far passage right into the room you're currently in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group opens the door, a soft glow illuminates the room.  The smell of dried blood - a pungent iron/metal smell - hits them all.  On the walls are racks of torture equipment along with various instruments for medical experimentation.  In the middle of the room, situated above a round, grated hole in the floor, is a strange table with holes in it, like a sieve.  Atop it, a familiar sight - a human dissected just like the illithid in the vault room; a Y incision splits the man's thoracic cavity and various organs have been shifted around and searched through.</p><p></p><p>As the light comes on, slowly, the human...  blinks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Dear DEKU!" Dieter shouts as he reels back from the startling movement.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, meanwhile, lets out a long low groan of wearied resolve. "Here we go again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco on the other hand, bobbles over to the splayed form and begins sniffing and licking intently.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group maneuvers in the room, assessing the scene, they can all see the man is pinned down in several areas.  His head is lashed to a headrest at the forehead and around his neck with what look to be metallic clasps that intricately link to the table.  There are more clasps on his arms and legs, and two large metal pieces sticking out from his hips.  The folds of his chest-skin are pinned to the table as well.  As Flayco starts licking the man's appendages, his fingers and toes react, but only slightly, as if there was a disconnect in the transmission of the impulse.  He blinks again, a bit faster now.  His mouth moves awkwardly, but no sound comes out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>While Dieter stares agog in disgust, Jaecob moves with resolute grit, pulling out his dagger and in one swift motion, laying the poor soul to rest.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter watches the scene unfold as if in a trance, unable to muster the call for Jaecob to halt.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gracious act from Jaecob is met with an unexpected hitch.  As the dagger lances into the man's jugular, the entire form on the table <i>pops</i> as if a bubble was burst.  Acidic slime bursts onto Muhlen's hands, dealing him 6 points of acid damage, but not poisoning him further.  The goo-man rushes through the sieve holes and down the grate in the floor, burbling all the way down.  </p><p></p><p>Left on the table is a small, purple/white crystal, about an inch long.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter hears a gasp in his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The disoriented Druid darts his eyes around as if searching for the source, willing it not to be from within.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"They've done it.  How?  How could they have possibly made it?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Jaecob?  You need to get out of there!  Right away!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Jaecob, I feel your father's spirit is close at hand. Hold steady."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter moves to the table and bends over the crystal to inspect.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Picking up the still slick crystal, it pulses with radiant light - for just a split second - when the druid touches it.  Unfortunately, though, he can't quite grasp what it's all about.  It seems like a normal crystal one would find in a cave somewhere.  With the exception of the radiant light part.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I don't like the looks o' that one lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The table is alien to this world, Jaecob can tell that from as close as he is.  The material it's made of is completely foreign to him.  Looking around at the implements, Dieter can see most of them are cleanm unused.  A couple of the medical implements, however, are red with blood.  An odd flask, with an amber liquid filled about halfway, stands near some of the instruments, its top off.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, a man hewn from tougher stuff than might be put off by such a grisly scene, heads over to the flask, lowering himself to it and drawing in a waft.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Smells acrid, biting.  A preservative of some sort?  (Perception for more!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(No worries, we'll take the first roll - 19.)</p><p>It's formaldehyde mixed with something else underneath.  Ammonia maybe?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid can tell it's for keeping something, especially organs and tissues, from the ravages of deterioration.  But whatever was added to it might either enhance or degrade the effects?  Or there could be a magical component to the micture, but it's hard to say without further experimentation.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmmph...better stopper this and keep it safe." he says, stowing the bottle now in his pack. "Gods be damned this place...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shaking his increasingly scruffly head, it had been a long time since he'd had a shave, Dieter heads back out of the room cursing, then looks dead on at the staircase ahead. "Are you ready, friends, to follow me to whatever end?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Sqwaaaaak!"</p><p>"Schluuurpp!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Grmph..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Alright then. <i>Follow me.</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves determinedly to the next destination, wondering if the Elf fared any better at this particular moment. <i>What would he have made of this?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Taking the NE door, the hallway leads to a curved wall and another door, slighly left ajar.  As soon as the first door is open, sounds of scuffling and scraping can be heard from the room beyond.  Yelling in a gutteral language and occasional yipping is heard, too, creating quite a din.  (No need to roll stealth, but if you want to check and see what's in the room, roll a sleight of hand, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter turns back to his crew and raises a finger to his lips as he crouches just a bit and sidles up to the door to take a peek.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door is only open a slight bit, and the number of beasts and creatures inside can't be figured.  But there are some large beasts...  and some creatures possibly training them.  And, amazingly enough, just beyond the crazed action of matted hair and green-grey bodies running amok, Dieter can see a lowered drawbridge and it's mechanism...  and grey stone beyond, a glint of sunlight - <i>real</i> sunlight - splashing on a crag several hundred feet beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Blessed be the light…” Dieter lets out a sigh of relief. He takes a moment to check himself over, patting down his various pockets and bags.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Stay here and wait for my signal,” he says the group, then lifts his left hand and touches his golden ring. His form dissipates into nothingness and the door opens gently.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Oh hey, didn’t see your reply.)</p><p>Dieter pulls back the door just far enough to squeeze through, then begins to move across the span and assess the masses for a potential plan, a potential route through. If they could just reach the bridge…</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It might be tough because not only are there a couple rough looking goblins, but they're training two very large animals...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Sensing now the closest thing to freedom he has seen in a long time, Dieter makes his move. He whispers back through the door to his crew, "Jaecob, be ready with your swords. Flayco, this time it's your turn to shine. Shelli...guard the door here." And with this, he moves off to the right side of the room, still invisible, preparing his energies for what is to come.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Before Jaecob can protest further, Flayco flops in and follows his person's orders. Squawking and making a grotesque yet comical scene as he enters into the room.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco let’s out a horrific gurgle as he hocks something up from deep within, then sprays back at his assailant.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Petulant stomping follows as the gross, thick spittle fails to fly forward and instead sticks to his front lip and flops down embarrassingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The sulking whelp stomps around in an erratic circle, flapping and flailing its displeasure.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Surprised at biting into something, the animal jumps back, letting the druid go and backing up a bit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Damnit!" Dieter lets out unwillingly as he reels from the bite. He pulls a bead of sweat now forming on his brow down and rubs it between his fingers. "Mother Sea guide me back home!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The small bead of sweat seems to drink the wind in from the opening to the sunlight. As it takes in the energies, it begins to swell and sway into a giant wash of water that pushes out across the room from Dieter, sweeping out and crashing upon the four hapless creatures.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>All effects removed from Dieter Deleter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter makes the most of this brief moment of surprise and chaos to dart further around the side of the room inching ever closer to the door, and light.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let's get the fuck out of here!" cries Jaecob, as a veil of red washes over his eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob hurls his dagger full force through as he steps momentarily through the door, then ducking  back in to take cover, knowing the plight he is currently in, the rage though continues to build.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The snail, nonplussed by the situation at hand, pulls her head back into her shell for the time being.</p><p>[Shell Defense]</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The barghest, confused by the water, knocked prone by it, is unsure how to proceed...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bite misses, but the claw rakes against the baby dragons' scales, drawing black ichor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men, looking around at the immediate chaos, see a few more doors in the room, aside from the lowered drawbridge - one to the W, one to the NE, the last to the SE.  When Dieter spies the door leading SE, Alezander Muhlen's breath is felt on the back of his neck.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Startled and a little grossed out, the Druid whips around to face the foul source.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing is there save for the two barghests.  However, you get the indication he wants you to go that route.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"You've got to be kidding me..." Dieter mutters as he stares longingly at the light then back at the door, then back at the light again. "Damn you Muhlen..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flapping wildly at the two assailants, Flayco reaches even deeper into his gastrointestinal stores...</p><p><i>Spat</i></p><p><i>Cloppp</i></p><p><i>Gorrphhh</i></p><p><i>Flaaaaaaghghggh!</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Wild eyeballs poking out of strange orifices in the whelp's flesh blink wildly in approval at the chaos.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shaking its head, trying to stave away the spell, it lashes out at the nearest target.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter grunts and mutters, “Here goes nothing.” He pulls a red vial from his pack and rolls it back toward his friends. “Here, take this! Cover me!” and with that, he dashed right into the draw between the two Bhargests pulling out his totemic bladestaff and beginning to sing a song of a lad that is gone.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob, seeing his friend’s battle cry, raises his voice to the frenzy, “Oooooooooo-ooo-o-o-oooooooooo!” He comes flying in with blade drawn. He flicks his foot up at the potion on the ground grasping it with his left hand in stride then dashes for the injured Barghest.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli, hearing the commotion, pops her head out of its shell and sees Jaecob has gone, she schultz over to the doorway and sees the dread melee unfolding.</p><p>“Baaaaaaaalk!!!” she cries, seeing Deiter in mortal combat with the two beasts.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!!!” Screams Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The snail, doing a double take a Jaecob’s errant strikes, slimes up to the first beast and lashes out with a tentacular flurry.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The slimy appendages merely slide of the writhing barghest’s matted fur leaving only a trail of ooze. </p><p>“Bwaaaalk!!!” she screeches.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Completely confused, probably trying to grasp what creature is in front of it - is it a dragon?  An octopus?  A squidling?  What the hell is it?! - the barghest blinks and the fighting continues!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A sickening smile stretches wide across the whelp’s grotesque face as it licks its lips and lunges at the beast in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco lurches to the side at the last minute as a threatening turn from the barghest makes him finch and miss.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Shell shocked by seeing an enormous creature enter the room, the barghest's mouth falls open...  and the fight continues!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Everyone! Behind me!  Go! Now!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter calls on the fury of an East wind being sucked out to sea in the eye of a great storm, blasting back the barghests and clearing a path for his companions to the door. “We must run, while we can!”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter runs to the door, throws it open, and sees a room filled with books and experiments, laboratory equipment and rows upon rows of items meant for magical use.  There is another door at the far end, next to a curved length of table with a variety of on-going experiments on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door can be locked once everyone is inside, there are three deadbolts.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They all make a mad dash for the door taking advantage of the Barghests’ confusion. Flayco, Jaecob, and Dieter all make the space in a few leaps then they turn back to see Shelli slowly moping across the floor. </p><p>“Come on girl!” Dieter cries.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Shelli dashes in reply. Never before had a snail been seen to slime so smoothly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Jaecob looks between the beasts and Dieter and the sunlight, grimacing with resolve before running toward the door and then quickly quaffing the potion he had received from Deiter’s throw once he is safe behind the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dashchleuurp.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The barghest, sensing something, takes off like a shot out of the downed drawbridge!</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Blarglemarglephaaaarg!!!" He shouts as the stream of misses continues, then dashes for the door in a ridiculous gait picking up his wings like a maids skirts as she walks through a muddy patch. Back and forth he waddles on two talons, eventually making it through the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Still trying to figure out what the hell Flayco is, the barghest stares, dumfounded.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter now shifts the direction of the wind slightly pushing the barghest North toward the drawbridge while still holding out at the door for Shelli.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Wind blows the coarse hair to a fro on the beast, but does not move him further.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“On Shelli!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>(Ha was just gonna do that 🙂  )</p><p>Jaecob begins milling about the room anxiously and looks over the various wares.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's strange, all of the equipment here seem to be...  foreign.  Alien, actually, as some of the handles on these are meant for longer limbs, elongated fingers, and there are thin layers of...  slime all over everything.  A couple potion bottles are stoppered on a shelf above some bubbling beakers.  The potions colors are red, black, and orange.  On the far table, a map is unfurled and red marks are made all over it - both writing and glyphs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He leaves the potion bottles for a moment heading over to the map to try and get some sort of orientation within this foul place. He turns and looks nervously back at the door as he does and gives Flayco a squish pat of appreciation at the effectiveness of his gross bile attack.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Schloooop! Schleeeeooooppp!!!! Scchlooooooorf!” She grunts at the final breakstalk pace she reaches lurching for the door.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Feeling as though the door is securely fastened, and not hearing the animal from beyond the threshold moving about, a calm comes over the group.  There is a sense of (strange) tension, either held over from the former fight or from the overwhelming <i>otherness</i> of the room.  Either way, the hackles are raised on all within that small study.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Well past the point of needing a breather, Dieter urges the group to sit for a moment before investigating further. He passes out what is left of the restoratives and passes out some rations. Jaecob tends to his various gouges and scrapes as the whelp and snail curl up beside one another for a short rest.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“You know, there’s something delicious about these swirling red ones after a fight…” Jaecob chuckles. </p><p></p><p>Dieter let’s out an appreciative snort in reply then gathers himself up enough to stand. It’s only now he begins to fully take in the room around him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the short rest continues, the druid looks around and sees everything Jaecob sees along with the door on the south wall.  It's made of a very strange material, akin to metal, again like the sieve-table.  Odd markings line the entire outline and a rectangle of different material is set into the direct middle of the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter walks over to the square and addresses it while Jaecob tends to raking the room for anything useful.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The off-colored rectangle in the middle of the door is non-descript, aside from it's different color than the rest of the door.  All of it has a dull metallic sheen to it, and the rectangle is darker that the rest.  The map is available for the taking (or inspection), as well as the potions on the wall.  There's also the individual potion ingredients strewn about the room, you can do a survival check to find out what you can get there.  (Or let me know if you're looking for something specific and I can let you know if it's there.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter strolls over and gives the map to Jaecob for a closer look while taking his time going over the nature of the alchemical supplies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are quite a few things here that are ingredients for health potions.  With that check, Dieter can get enough for 2 standard or 1 greater.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We had better take our time here getting ready. Who knows when we'll be able to breathe next." Dieter intones ominously which is met with a gruff acquiescent grunt from Muhlen junior.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter sets about his work, thinking back to the priestess of Ilmater all that while ago and of the deadly chase of the Muhlen sisters... <i>Jaecob...</i></p><p></p><p>"I...I am sorry Jaecob. I'm not sure if we've ever discussed what happened...to your...father's favorite daughters..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The map is a detailed crosssection of the underdark, or at least certain strategic locations.  Several cities are mentioned - Menzoberranzan, Earth's End, Gauntlgrym, Blingdenstone, Sloopdilmonpolop - but the biggest one, a section with a giant circle around it, is the <i>Fallen City of Asharladon</i>.</p><p></p><p>The potions are - standard health potion, potion of clairvoyance, and potion of scrying.  </p><p></p><p>Lastly, it's unclear as to what needs to be done with the door, but it looks really solid.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Veena...Hozieh..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shifts uncomfortable in his stance.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, them.  Ye kill 'em?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Taken aback at the matter-of-fact tone, Dieter stumbles to a few nods and grunts. "I am sorry."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nah, don't be.  They've been tryin' to kill me for years.  Why else do ya think I'm hiding around down here, gatherin' my own army?  They were always tryin' to take control of the Runemark legacy, along with Wilm.  Shits, all of 'em.  Here's the question, though...  ye sure they're dead?"  He winks at you, goodnaturedly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter’s uncomfortable shifting takes on a new tone. <i>Could he be sure? Everything was- is such a blur now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I need to get back to the sea.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Not me.  Staying the hell away from there, if I can help it.  I ever tell you about my time with the giants?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go on…”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Where we got our family name from, "The Runemark".  See, my father, that rat bastard, sailed the Sea of Swords all the way across the world.  Legends say he went to Maztica, some say he fell of the side of the world, others mention a portal that took him to the island of the giants.  Whichever way he got there, he got there.  He used to tell us that he was stranded, all of his crew gone, and the giants were about to kill him when he offered them a scroll of wish...  Bullshite if ye ask me, but any way ye cut it, he came back from that situation with the knowledge of giant runes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Those things are inherently magic, and he could have been an artificer or enchanter, maybe even an evoker...  but what does he do?  Writes on lead and copper pieces a rune that turns them into gold!  And it's an illusion spell, so it doesn't actually <i>change</i> anything, just make 'em look like gold!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Rat bastard.  Created a whole business with those coins.  Traded with 'em, built a merchant empire...  No doubt if you head back to the sea, you'll maybe see a few pass through your pockets.  And people are none the wiser.  Not to say they aren't really what they seem, I guess.  But with all of that power, all of that magical acumen, what does he do?  Swindle and rob.  Great legacy, eh?  Now you know why I'd've just traded in the Runemark magic when it passed to me.  Who knows what would've happened if my sisters or brother would've gotten it, though.  Maybe it's for the best."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shrugs and meanders off to look at the 'metal' door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Anyway, there's a story in my family that a huge trove of real treasure is buried on the sea.  Under that guise, I hired a crew and sailed the Sea myself, kinda tryin' to find the treasure island...  but really, I was shootin' fer a way back to the isle of the giants...  And I found it!  When I got there, only a few giants were left, actually.  There was a small tribe of about seven or eight, and no youngins.  Their magic was still strong, though, and so I tried to barter with them for the magical knowledge.  They had heard about my father, and since that time have never offered their magics up to 'off-landers', they said.  I told them I understood, but since I was there, since I actually found the place, I wasn't going back empty handed.  They were unwilling to leave the island, even though it looked like they would be extinct in a matter of time.  I offered to bring more of their kind to the island, which they took to immediately.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So, that's how I became a giant runner.  At first, I would go out with a crew of adventurers - mercenaries, really - and we would capture giants and relocate them to the island.  That only worked two times.  The first one was pretty stupid, so he took to the relocation fine, but the second...  was a fighter!  Almost killed the whole crew when he woke up mid-trip!  We got it into our heads that we could find giants and let them know about the solitary island, and that worked much better.  And eventually, as the tribe grew, they offered me my reward...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He pulls up his shirt to show a large runic tattoo laced around his back that goes around his side and travels up to his shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"They wouldn't tell me what it does, but I've been dyin' to know!  They said if I came back with more of their kinfolk, they would share the meanings of some of them.  Matter of fact, I was tryin' to find some when I ran into this craziness with my brother creating the 'Runemark Army' and taking over the local areas.  Not sure if I'm going to make it out of this, but if I do...  Maybe I'll just find a wizard to tell me what these things mean.  But there's no way I'm going back to the water, not any more.  Got a bad feeling about all of it.  Feels like tempting fate if I were to sail again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter stands still a long while soaking this in. His minds eye floats outward across Mount Hotenow passing the Sword Coast and out to the Trackless Sea and boarding a Northbound ship. Cold winds pull harshly across patchy stubble as the winds of Winter whisper in early. Off in the distance, somewhere through an icy mist, a land of deep magic and mysterious creatures…</p><p></p><p>His gaze returns to the room and Jaecob then down to the tattoo. He chuckles a bit and says, “Thought you’d go back and do the thing <i>properly</i>, huh?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Maybe.  Maybe I was just hoping for more...  just, more.  More than my father.  Rat bastard.  Thing is, I received the Runemark legacy as we were coming back into port; Luskan actually, and...  well...  A part of me knows what my tattoo <i>could</i> do...  I think.  It's complicated.  But I can use some giant runes, I just...  don't know how I do them.  Does that make any sense?  Sometimes...  I think I'm crazy, ya know?"</p></div>
<div class="character-7"><p>"Yeah, I'm probably crazy."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Friend, this whole damned world is crazy. But you’re the one I’ve got right here and  now and I’m none to judge. I’ve…made my choices in life…” something dark seems to swim across Dieter’s eyes as he says this. There is a sadness there that Jaecob hadn’t marked before. </p><p>“Anyway, maybe you could do something with this here stumper. Perhaps those runes will come of use as we try to unwind the dread knot your father has tied us all into.”</p></div>
<div class="character-7"><p>"Hope so.  Not sure about everything down here, it seems like a whole new world.  Makes me wonder what he actually got hisself into.  Like, the agreement with the Yuan-ti to ressurect the Great World Serpent is one thing, but these guys...  that <i>thing</i> that was torn apart in the chamber...  Not sure what to do with all this information, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-7"><p>"Like this door.  These markings are totally foreign.  Do you recognize them?  Maybe from my father's crazy book?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter thinks back to the book, it's writing coherent at first, but then deteriorating to the scrawl of a madman. <i>Do I? Do I remember?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter searches his trusty bag for his book storage area and while rooting around finds a few flecks or rotten snake hide from so long ago. He smiles, nostalgically thinking about Vam and Heston, then turns his attention back to the matter at hand. He finds the tome and pulls it out, rereading and scanning for any passages that might speak of this.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The writing around the door elude to something being needed to press to the rectangle on the door, some type of biological agent that is required to gain access to the secret within.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Do you suppose a Giant’s cock is squared like this?” Dieter half-jests to Jaecob, not one hundred percent sure he want to know the answer.</p></div>
<div class="character-7"><p>"Ya know, I dont think I ever want to find out the answer to that question, Dieter.  But if it's biology they want, don't we have some souvenirs from them?  If not, I know where we could get some..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter checks over his packs but comes up short. He then replies, “Where did you say we could get some?”</p></div>
<div class="character-7"><p>"Back at the vault.  I can run back.  What should I grab, though?"</p></div>
<div class="character-8"><p><i>"My remains are past this door.  If I remember right, they placed their slimy face tentacles on the block to get in.  Disgusting creatures.  Be wary, it feels as if there's still one lingering around me, even now..."</i></p></div>
