<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue preens.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Somewhere in a far off dungeon, Dieter broods...with his brood.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The cold, bedraggled crew carries on down the West offshoot.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group makes it's way farther down the passages, farther seemingly <i>into</i> a complex of sorts.  The walls are contoured and sculpted, with patterns and pictures scattered throughout.  As the foursome enter into the passage, a rancid stench greets their nose.  Another long hallway opens in front of them, with a passage and broad stairs on their right (N), another broad passage to the left (S), and a crumbling wall revealing a purplish glow in front of them, 35 feet away (W).</p><p></p><p>Atop the stairs to the North, a small creature is floating above the stone floor...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Mree...  mree mree...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"What curious oddity is this?" Maouelue exclaims. It appears fascinated by its own hands! Granted, If I had quite so many, I'd be fascinated as well." He casts a glance at Bella, concealing a wry smile.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Worried more about the expanding gas than the creature, the group doesn't get a great read on it's intentions.  However, it doesn't seem aggressive at the moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let's steer clear of that one for the moment," the Metal Mage offers, "We'll scout around a bit first. Could this be the underbelly of the Fortress? That would be astonishing...yet somewhat intentional. Ah the whims of the Source are hard to fathom at time. I remember how Shi'Vandos used to go on at length about the mysterious weave of time and energy that constitute the Planes we inhabit. He would speak to me of deep, untraceable connections between different times and spaces. Ah, how I wonder what he might say could he be here right now." </p><p>The mage's musing turn to soliloquy as the power of this place mingles with his memories.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage comes to as if from a daydream of his ancestors. </p><p></p><p><i>Albrek...</i></p><p></p><p>He leads on West down the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's all coming together... 😀)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue leads his companions past the curious flumph and into the Western corridor.  The hall would normally have ended in a solid stone wall, however there is now a decent sized hole in the Northern wall through which the party sees more purple and yellow mushrooms.  Their glow gives the room an eerie, almost ominous presence.  As Maouelue looks into the room, to the South a hard scraping and low growl can be heard.  And felt, as the bass resonance shakes the walls and floors, rattling their bones.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A word whispered in Sylvan sends Maouelue's familiar ahead to scout the birds eye view of the disturbance.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bird takes it's time flying to a few different areas.  First, the bird tracks North, through the purple mushroom area into another wide stone room, looking like an entrance room.  Farther north it views a large space with four wide columns holding up the weight of the mountain.   A room juts to the East from here, bringing the bird back, first, to the pool the group was dropped in then back to the purple mushroom room.  Heading back to the 'Entrance Hall', the bird then takes a small passage west, which expands to a hallway to the S.  Two doors on the E walls and a door at the end of the southward hall bar the birds path further.  </p><p></p><p>The bird returns to the group, then flits south, into another small entrance way, and then into a molten furnace of a lava flow.  A few beings splash around in the flow, but the bird is able to stay well above the heat and find a separate, return passage back to the party.  (Roll20 is updated, too!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The first big circle on the top of the map is what?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>I guess the first point of investigation</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Inv check, please!  Or perception.)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Damn!!)  </p><p>The coast looks pretty clear.  Nothing moving, no sounds save for the dripping of water to the W and the rush of those drainage tunnels to the E.  There is a fallen door on the S side of the room, but it was knocked down ages ago, most of it is splinters now.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Was there anything in particular you wanted to check on or investigate?  We'll use the same roll.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(looking for any markings or symbols on the walls or in the construction)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a lot of rubble around, but of the stone you can see, there are what look like draconic runes etched in random places on the walls, ceiling, and floor.  Nothing that is cohesive or makes sense to any of you, though.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a few moments to make some rubbings of the runes in his book before leading the party on down the hall. (Toward the second smaller circle)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In a 30ft by 30ft more draconic etchings line the wall, most are prominent near and on the massive bronze door leading W.  There is also a large bronze door going S.  Both look locked and, again, <i>massive</i>.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue reaches out with his feelings....</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Both have heavy abjuration (warding) magics surrounding them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Can anyone read any of this? It all appears to be magically sealed."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix and Benna come forward, inspecting the doors.  Daran looks on from afar but mainly walks around the room, every once in a while he will reach out and trace a draconic mark.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran makes his way over after a few minutes, the women whispering back and forth to each other.  </p><p></p><p>"Maouelue, a word?  I've been looking at these marks on the walls.  They continue through the caverns here, and are heaviest on the western door.  Now, I'm not a scholar... but these don't look like letters.  They're too random.  They look like...  scratches.  As if...  Well, it's almost as if some creature, maybe even a dragon, was housed here and forced through that doorway."  He points W.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A cold shiver runs down the mage's spine, chilling even beyond his inner frost. "A Dragon? Here?" Maouelue considers a moment, apparently lost deep in thought. "My friends, I must meditate on this. Let us set our camp here for awhile and secure our position.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As the team sets up the perimeter, Maouelue takes his helm in hand and assumes a lotus pose, his hands channeling through the Frostbitten Helm. He reaches out to his patron, searching for the spirit of the dragon.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue reaches out with his arcana, his sense is able to pass around the area, even showing him an alternative route around the S door.  When he attempts to search past the W door, however, he is gently rebuffed.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The wizard gets up abruptly and moves back down the East corridor to inspect the broken door pieces in the next room. He tries to make out how it had been mounted and how it might have fallen.</p>

<p><i>A blue-white light courses through the metal mage's mass of flowing locks revealed by his doffed helm. The hairs seem to fairly float and become translucent in the cavern mist.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
A scene plays out in the mages mind: *Elves are throwing ropes over something extremely large, trying to have them reach to their brethren flanking the beast.  There are dozens of elves moving around it, several get flung aside as a massive clawed paw comes slashing through Maouelue's view.  Suddenly, huge wings, blacker than pitch and wreathed in smoke, elongate and stretch over it's massed enemies.  With a roar that nearly splits the mages head in twain, the shadow beast tries to throw off it's paltry bonds.  As it in slow motion, a noosed rope is thrown perfectly into the air, nearly bouncing off the room's ceiling.  It effortlessly, amazingly slips over the dragon's neck, and Aefir Nightseeker gallantly strides up the beaat's tail to it's back, tightening the noose with a handsome smile on his face.  In seconds, the dragon is trussed and with a massive effort, it is pulled through heavy bronze doors.  As they're shut, a blue-pink glow wreaths the closed doors for a moment, then silence remains.*

Maoeuelue wakes bathed in sweat.

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(History check, at advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Getting some crossover here!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aefir Nightseeker was instantly recognizable to Maouelue.  He is a myth, a legendary elven figure.  He was said to be the right hand of Corellon Larethian, progenitor of the entire elven race.   He was golden in hue, from head to toe, and was said to be the father of the Summer Eladrin, where they got their coloring from.  Hundreds of thousands of stories are told of his conquests and vanquishing of foes.  A couple of the most famous are his Five Trials, also known as the Trials of Aefir, where he searched and found the 'Eye of Darkness'.  Another that immediately comes to Maouelue is the story of the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil.  It is said Aefir conquered it single-handedly and locked it away underneath a mountain.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Mhaor’isel Ghaatiil... Could it really be?</i></p><p></p><p>A thrill of apprehension and starlight seem to both invigorate and rivet the mage on the spot. What could have led him here at this moment? The strings of lore  tug at the very sinews of Maouelue’s body as he moves back to the group. </p><p></p><p>“We must tread carefully here. While my heart yearns to see and connect to the draconian mysteries here, my head pushes, may, pulls me away. Let us go around here to the South, through the mushroom Room. The Mush Room. The Shh Room. Let us be very very quiet...”</p><p></p><p><i>The mage’s voice reverberates to a halt among the silent cohort.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna and Bellatrix look relieved, they weren't able to get very far with the door's magic.  Daran look pensive.  All gather their things and follow Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the group travels back to the entrance hall, they can see the other door they were opposite of to the N of them.  Over time, the mushrooms toxicity must have eaten away the stone enough to allow for passages through this underground edifice.  The remaining hallway curves around to the S, and the group take the passage until they come to a choice.  Three doors are before them.  One right in front of the group, on the E wall, another one farther S on the same wall, then the hall ends in another door.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They take a listen at the near door and Maouelue tests its lock.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception for listening, investigation for the lock, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<p>(🪨 🪨 🪨 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Wow!)</p><p>There is a fell wind blowing in the other side of the door, but very quietly.  Maouelue's elven ears pick it up, but it probably would have been overlooked by another's ear.  The lock is ancient and arcane in nature.  There is no keyhole, just a bronze knob jutting out.</p><p>(Arcanca  check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are a couple spells that could open or suppress the lock, but their names are eluding you.  You can try to break it down, but the magic makes the door stronger, thus tougher to break.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Please do m’lady”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She gives Maouelue a wry, flirty smile.  Then she raises her hands and closes her eyes.   Bowing her head, she recites some words in a strange dialect.  Blue sparks erupt from her rotating hands.  They mix and spark against the pink glow.  As the two colors grow brighter, they have their own battle against the door.  A sharp crackle, sizzle, then a pop of light sends both colors fading away.  All watch as the door knob turns slowly.  With a soft <i>click</i>, the door opens inward.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Darkness greets the foursome.  A small sound comes from the back of Bellatrix's throat and she retreats to the other side of the hallway, shaken.  Daran peeks around the corner of the doorway.  "Want me to head in first?  I can see pretty well in the dark."</p><p>(Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is dusty and dank, smelling of mildew and old rot.  A large pile of bones is piled up against the far wall.  Nothing stirs.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue inspects what kind of bones they might be.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue enters the eerie room, followed close behind by Daran.  The women stay in the hall, Bellatrix peers through the doorway.  (Investigation check, with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage sifts through the slimy, mold-covered bones.  skulls, ribs, femurs, ulnas, a plethora of tarsals and metacarpals are heaped together.  After a few moments and careful study both Maouelue and Daran notice something...  shift.  A bone vibrates off to the side, close to the N wall.  Then two, three, four start to shiver and some start to move, connecting together.  The group hears the clicks and rattles of bones knitting themselves together until, in front of them stands...</p>

<p>The panther doesn't sense Daran at all.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A cold fury runs through Maouleue. </p><p>“It is time. Get ready.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The panther assumes a position so as to run down the hall and pounce on the beast as it reappears. Maouleue cycles his concentration for maximum damage. Bella and Benna ready their respective beams.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A bead of sweat runs down Bellatrix's brow.  Benna's eerily quiet.  That strange bass shaking rumbles softly through the floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Where the beast should have appeared...  nothing materializes.  Benna chuckles, once.  Bellatrix closes her eyes and lowers her hands.  A soft sob escapes her.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a <i>pop</i> makes the quartet jump, even scaring the panther.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>In the middle of the room is the end of the monster's tail bone, dripping with venom.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Add dagger of venom to your inventory.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Telepathically, to all</i> "This is my end of the bargain."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Benna! You beauty!” A few metal-clad moments later and Benna is set back down to earth by the magnanimous mage.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Apprehensive glances are cast all around. </p><p>“<i>Right!</i> Let us make haste!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Benna: "What just happened?!"

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Where to now?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You? You tell <i>us!</i>”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “We can’t leave Daran! Where is he?!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Maouelue: “Bella...I’m afraid Daran walks a path that none of us can follow now.”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Benna: "Honestly, these spells are so old, I don't know what they do anymore.  I guess that's what he wanted, to be sent away?  Glad it worked out, in the end.  Just wish I would have thought of it before Daran..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “Noooooooooooooo!!!”

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes her in his albeit cold hard arms.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna will comfort her as well, rubbing her back.  </p><p>"There's no body.  That could actually be a good thing."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We may yet see Daran again...someday.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: *Sniffle* “Oh...okay...”
*Please! Let him live!*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Was that last for me?!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue harries the group south down the corridor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>The first is a potion of gaseous form, enough for two people.  The other is a superior potion of healing.</p><p>The 'coin' on the wall depicts a fire giant, head wreathed in flames like Roman laurels.  The trio knows very well that giants are world renown for their rune mastery, some of which can be seen on the rim of the golden circle.  (Anyone speak Giant?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Mao speaks Giant)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Maouelue reads around the edges: *The High Lord Zalto, King of the Fire Giants.  This is our passage back home.  Let what was once sundered be made anew.*

<p><i>The panther is now standing on hindquarters, raising both fists in tacet approval.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The mage looks closer at the runes, and there seems to be another, thinner line of script written around a symbol of two dragons chasing one-another's tail.  The dragon symbol is in red against the gold background, and the ring around the symbol states, <i>Those with the dragon mark, a red dragon lineage, or fire giant heritage, place your hand upon the seal and open the gate.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Uncertain, Maouelue hesitantly extends his hand, palm outward to the seal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmph, worth a shot." He casts a glance around. "Any of you?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Assuming there are empty gazes,) Maouelue takes a moment to do another rubbing taking the contours this seal down into his book. He looks one more time around the device for any other signs of concealment before leading the group down to the doorway at the end of the hall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The women shake their heads as they gather up some of the treasures.</p><p>Upon exiting, the three notice a rotten stench coming from the end of the hallway, not altogether different than the flumph gave off.  A sickly yellow-green mist comes up from the bottom of the door., which stands a bit ajar already.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sends a blast of hot fire searing toward the doorway, standing at the edge of range.</p>

<p>Maouelue and Bellatrix take 9 points of damage, Benna takes the full 19 as the flames incinerate the simple door and back-drafts straight to them.  As soon as the rush of fire passes, they hear a low laughter coming from inside the now very smokey room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Gonna end for tonight. Packing!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: "By the GODS Mao? What are you DOING?"

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Agh Benna! I suppose....I should have asked you all to stand back. Something about the deep places brings out my quixotic impetuousness."</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>
Maouelue: 41/51 (-9)

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"You in there!," Maouelue's voice cracks a bit as he attempts a challenging tone, "Show yourself!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is shuffling from the room, as smoke continues to billow out.  The laughing turns to gruff growling and a metallic scraping can be heard just under the growling.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A big booming rumble of a voice breaks the eerie silence, saying, "WHO'S THERE?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue sets his metallicomets spinning around him, like a fiercely charged atom, hoping stir the air and clarify the fog a bit.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"It is I, Lumao Albrek. I come solely in the pursuit of justice and peace."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Bellatrix whispers, "Mao... are you <i>sure</i> about this?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"DON'T KNOW NO...  MAYO.  GO AWAY."  The voice, although booming, sounds a bit forlorn.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue steps forward into the smoke, comets a-swirling. "Though it may not seem it, we do not come to threaten. Tell us, who are you? What is your station here?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I AM SNARR THE ONE-HANDED.  I HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED HERE FOR MANY YEARS.  THE WIZARD, HE TOOK MY HAND SO HE COULD TRAVEL, THEN LOCKED ME AWAY HERE FOR ETERNITY... JUST IN CASE HE NEEDED ANOTHER HAND."  (All of this has been in Giant, by the way.  The women would have no clue what or who you're talking to!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Tell me, O mighty SNARR, just who was this <i>wizard</i> of whom you speak. Tell me, and mayhaps we can be of service to <i>each other</i>."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A shuffling then a huge <i>WHUMP</i> sounds on the other side of the doorway.  Smoke rushes and billows out past the heroes, clearing to see a humongous fire giant looking at them through the doorway.</p><p>"CAN YOU GET ME HAND BACK?  IT WAS THE BAD WIZARD.  CALLED HIMSELF SHIV THE DRAGON.  LAST I SAW HE CUT OFF ME HAND AND WENT THROUGH THIS DOOR."  He points to the doorway with his hand-less stump.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Come then Snarr. There is something you need to see. Perhaps something that will find you <i>exactly</i> what you seek. Follow me."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue considers something a moment...</i></p><p></p><p>"...Unless you are in some way bound...?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I AM.  I'M TOO BIG TO FIT THROUGH THE DOOR." Maouelue can see it would be impossible to get him out through the door in between them.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Hmm...let me think a moment..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(did the seal in the last room look immobile?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It did, yes.  Looked connected to the wall somehow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If you would let me do something...<i>a bit of a trust exercise</i>....I may just have an answer. How well do you feel at the moment?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"WELL...  THAT FIRE DIDN'T HURT, TICKLED REALLY, BUT...  I'M KINDA HUNGRY.  COULD USE SOME FOOD.  DRINK IF YE HAVE IT.  THEY DON'T FEED ME MUCH, I THINK THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"HOW'RE YOU?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Ah yes, I know we've got a bit here somewhere." He grabs a few rations from his pack. "Ah yes, here we go. It's not much, but hopefully it's a start!" He leans back a moment to fill the others in about the goings-on.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The giant eats, eagerly.  (You made a friend!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yay!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"While you eat, friend, we will sit down the hall while the smoke clears, sorry about that by the way, and recover our strength. We'll need it for what comes next..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>[short rest/(Feywild LR)]</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Snarr offers for you to come into the vast room and eat with him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Indeed, we will join you! Come Bella, come Benna!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he sees the women, he says, "OOOH, PRETTIES!!"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He waves with his good hand.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Alright, alright, keep your hand to yourself!" He smirks.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He looks abashed and sits on his hand.  Bellatrix smiles at him, though, and that brightens him up.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Ok then Snarr, it looks like we’re about ready then. I just need to know one thing. Do you want to do the honors or me?” He pulls out the Mace of Reduction and proffers it. “All it will take is one <i>good</i> strike, and we should be in business.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"MAYBE WE CAN TAKE TURNS?  WHAT AM I HITTING?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Well you see here Snarr, the thing is, this mace right here...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>He gestures again with the mace.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...will cast a reduction spell on you if we get it <i>just</i> right.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(🤣  Sure!  Here's what I'll tell you - AC 18 is where he's at.  I'll say if you get him to half his hit points before a crit...  you're going to have an angry fire giant on your hands!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Here let me ease this for you a bit.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“There, does that help?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You haven't hit him yet!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Oh right!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"YEP!  THANKS!"  He scratches his head with his stump.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The giant, in a sudden spasm, shrinks down to half his size, stunning the ladies who didn't know you could do that!</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Snarr, surprised by seeing the small people get large, takes a few moments to re-orient himself.  </p><p>"Hmmm."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Don’t I need a nat 20? Or is this a little DM leniency?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>After a time, he notices the door is significantly more...  available to proceed through, and smiles at Maouelue.</p><p>(Crits on a 19+)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Y’alright there sNARR? Here, take this.”</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“That ought to help a little anyway. Now follow us!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He follows, mesmerized at finally leaving his prison.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I’d say, ‘Smell the fresh air,’ but....”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads the brief way down the hall and shows the seal to sNARR. “I think the answer to your questions lies here, friend.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I know not what will happen, but if we don’t see each other again, I wish you the best in  your search. Let the name Lumao “Maouelue” Albrek be known as a friend to the Giants.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With wide eyes, he enters the treasure room, gazing at the wondrous wealth and shiny things.  Then his gaze lands on the 'coin' on the wall, and his mouth falls open even farther.  As he moves towards the object, there is a low humming that starts.  Everyone looks around, but as Snarr gets closer to the 'coin', the humming quite obviously gets louder and louder.  As he reaches for it, puts his hands on it, the humming turns into a heartbeat, the now very loud <i>thrumm thrumm</i> echoing around the room and seemingly throughout the underground complex.  </p><p></p><p>Snarr's hands move around some of the runes, then he finds the dragon mark.  As his hand touches it, like molten gold melting away, the patina of the 'coin' falls away and a blast furnace of heat greets the adventurers.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue’s blue orbs shrivel a little.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“If I may....before you go...what is this place?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A long time ago, Zalto, the guy up there, split the fire giant ordning so's we couldn't come back to our home in the elemental plane of fire.  We'd been kicked out so long...  I'm not even sure there are any more of my kind over there.  But, anything is better than being here.  Thank you, Maouelue, friend o'the giants.  I will tell others of your great deeds."  He bows low to Maouelue and the women, then steps through the gate and, in reverse, the molten gold flows back up to re-seal the 'coin'.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The group lingers in the silence, in the space that for the first time in who knows how long, was no longer a prison. They move into the room vacated by Snarr gathering in their surroundings. Maouelue asks Benna to provide some light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(If she’s still hurt, he’ll heal them up too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll say over the short/long rests everybody's up to full with everything - save the stuff used recently.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is the biggest space the group has seen so far.  Cracks in the floor reveal where the methane gas has been coming from.  Just below the floor seems to be a lava run, which had been eroding various minerals.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Bellatrix: “Jeez Mao, you could have blown the whole place!”

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The only exit, save the way the group had come through, is a solid bronze door at the south-eastern end of the room.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>A rattling of a door handle can be heard over the din in the room.  A door opens, steps echo...</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The party, licking their wounds, stands to attention...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p><i>Step step, click...  step step, click...</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>An old man's voice, "Snarr?  Snarr, did you finally break that blasted door down."  He chuckles softly.   "'Bout damned time."</p><p><i>Click, step step...  click, step step...</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Snarr is gone. He left through the seal. And you? Which way will you go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>Maouelue’s travails are clearly getting the better of his temperament.</i></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>One more <i>click</i> and an ebony staff comes into view, attached to a gnarled and wrinkled hand.  Rounding into view is an old eladrin man, with white hair down to his waist.  He wears it unadorned, loose, and most of it is fly-away.  His eyes are piercing lavender, but he looks worried.  "And who might you be?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I...” Maouelue falters a moment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“...I am called Maouelue.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin nods.  Then shakes his head.  "That may be the name you use, but not the name you were given.  What have you done with my giant?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye. You seem to know me old one. As I said before, Snarr has felt the seal. Are you the one that took his arm then?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He shakes his head again.  "No, not I.  The one that imprisoned all of us down here.  We all serve The Dragon.  For good or ill.  More than likely ill.  Do you and your lasses enjoy tea?  I might be able to find something stronger, given time."  He turns and starts walking back the way he came.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao leans to the others, “Who <i>is</i> this guy?”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They follow a few paces back.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gonna pause there tonight, friend.  I'm beyond exhausted, turning in early.  We'll see who he is soon!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group follows the old elf a short pace to a nicely lit room, which you all notice immediately is temperature controlled as well.  A cool, calming feeling comes over you all as you are urged into the space.  There are bookshelves, desks, and an experimentation table set up, alongside a pair of chairs and a rickety but nicely maintained cot.  Because of the plethora of items in the room, there's not much space for movement.  It reminds all of a prison cell, albeit a comfortably adorned one.  The elder eladrin offers everyone seats and brings over a freshly brewed pot of tea.  He conjured cups for each of you and asks, "So, who's for tea?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue politely accepts.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Bella and her sister are a bit hesitant, but figure it’s best to go along.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles, pours, as well as one for himself.  And the tea is excellent, a hint of jasmine and honeysuckle, very light and sweet.  The eladrin sips and leans against one of his tables.  Smiling at the arranged crew, he says, "So.  I can only assume you have many questions.  I have a few myself.  Who would you prefer to begin?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Please, speak. We are...a bit out of our element here...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"No pun intended, of course."  He smiles.  "Firstly, I would know why you don't go by your true name all of the time.  Is it shame or convenience?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I have only <i>just</i> learned it. It still sits oddly on my tongue.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would imagine so.  If you don't mind me saying so, that name will become infamous.  If it isn't already so.  You might be able to change that, but...  we shall see.  Now, on to better things, what exactly brought you to the bowels of the Fortress of Frozen Tears?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>The words seem to unsettle Maouelue who shifts uncomfortably on the spot.</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It would seem I am led here by more than one thread of fate, if everything I have heard these past months is to be believed.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"And which threads would those be?"  He sips his tea.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a deep breath before speaking.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I was told...I have a brother here. A brother whom I have never met.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin nods, encouragingly.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We seem also to follow, or be drawn along, in the wake of a mysterious Runemark. Giants and Dragons and Naga....oh my. It’s quite a tale in its own right...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“It led us to the Summer Eladrin...the city of Starlight...” <i>The Mage’s voice drifts off into a minute reverie...</i> “And now here, under the frozen Fey tundras have we slipped and fallen on the slide of hubris, and though I feel nearer my destination than ever, the more I feel it sliding away.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Nay, lad, you're not sliding away.  Although, the path ahead is extremely treacherous indeed.  As you've already seen."  He looks meaningfully at the trio.  "That being said, what little aid I can give you, I shall.  On one condition.  There is a spell that I have been trying to break for some time.  It seems the mage who locked myself and my cohorts down here liked to play with planar binding magics.  In the castle above, there is a crystal which should be the source of the binding.  Search this out and destroy it, and my aids will not be given in vain.  Is this acceptable?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue nods, reverently.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“We will break the stone. But pray, give us your name...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He smiles.  "My name...  is Aeneir."  (History check with advantage, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue recognizes the name immediately, but many of the stories he's been told are a bit hazy as they were told to him as a child.  Aefir had a younger brother, Aeneir, who was a great mage.  A seer.  It is said that through Aeneir's divination magic, Aefir was able to know about his destiny.  If this eladrin is serious, he would have to be way older than the Summer Court members, and, quite possibly, the oldest elf in all of the planes.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“<i>Æneìr?....</i>”</p><p></p><p>“<i>Can it be?...</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It can.  And is.  The damnable wizard we both seek conjured me up from the aether and bade me do his bidding.  I've been on death's doorstep for millennia.  It would be good to...  take the next step.  That is where you and your retinue come in."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“What can you tell us about what we might find above?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"A castle of ice and frost.  I'd wager you'd do well to find boots that grip the ground or you'll be sliding constantly.  It has been some time since I last traversed the palace... but both our wizard and the Pale Prince enjoy their...  creatures.  Abominations lie in wait, and more than likely a guard for the crystal.  Wits and cunning will go a long way, too.  Did you have any <i>special</i> requests in mind?"  He smirks and sips more tea.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Can you sense the presence of a half-elf that recently disappeared from here? He was of our party when...the demon...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir looks sadly down at the ground, then up to meet all of the eyes staring back at him.  "Sense... no.  But his destiny lives on past this day.  You may yet find him on the material plane.  Or maybe your ancestors will.  It's times like this I miss my eyeglasses.  I used to look over the top of them when I said things that profound."  He chuckles and pours more tea, offers to the rest.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The group looks stricken for a few beats, then....</p><p></p><p>“Do you insinuate some other <i>special</i> that you would grant us in hopes of fulfilling this duty?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"There are boons...  and there are boons.  It would depend on what you feel you need, but...  I'd like to be of some service to your party, yes."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Most gracious of you indeed. I do feel there is <i>something</i> missing as yet from our fold..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I fear our deficit may be a direct result of my, ahem, penchant for impetuousness. Perhaps summat that would allow me to either prevent or assuage harm that I might cause along the way. Something to protect those around me. I am a mage, but also a man of metal. The Platinum wants not but for zeal..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin smiles kindly at the mage.  "There is no deficit, although I understand why you would feel that way.  All you need to do is ask.  I can only give what I have, but it might be that the stars will align?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Please then, give us this boon. We ask in the name of Albrek."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He narrows his eyes, eventually nodding and closing them.  He raises his hands at the Dragon Mage, a gold glow surrounds Maouelue...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Oh, and you'll find three pairs of boots outside the room."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>!item boots of the winterland</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We are most grateful for these gifts. On the edge of a knife, it helps to keep one's balance. May our mutual ends be met with such true aim."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can we rest here and prepare new spells?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Absolutely!  And, speaking of resting, Imma pause there for tonight, sir!  Hope the packing is going well.  Talk to you tomorrow?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Thanks man! Those are cool boons! I'm gonna rethink completely how I'm approaching spell prep. Not sure if there's a way to add that boon in Beyond or Avrae, but we'll figure it out.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"I would suggest putting the boots on before your long rests.  You can attune to them properly that way.  Also, I know you ladies have not had a proper rest.  Here.  Take this and be well."  Aeneir gives the women a glass of something.  "I'll just be writing here at my desk.  Please rest, and let me know if you require anything else."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Aye, we will take rest here and plan for the trials ahead. Thank you Æneìr. May this be the beginning of a new era here at the Fortress of Frozen Tears.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group takes the rest, getting things together, planning for the next steps of the mission.  The liquid in the glasses that the ladies drank healed their exhaustion and let their short rest work as a long rest.  Everyone has new boots, and before long, everyone is ready to trek out.  (Anything you'd like to do or discuss in the interim?)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I have to take Quinn to soccer. I still have to rejigger my spells. I’ll do that tonight probs.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, brother.  Have fun with soccer!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Pray, before we go, I would ask of you one more thing. Would it be too much to ask for a handwritten spell scroll, something of your design. I am first and foremost a scholar, and should I...we make it out of here alive, I would be honored to add another page in your history back at our academy."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir's back is to the group, writing at his desk.  Maouelue sees his shoulders briefly raise a couple times, and he turns in his chair rolling up a piece of parchment. </p><p></p><p>"Great minds, and all that," he says as he hands the rolled up parchment to the mage.  </p><p></p><p>As Maouelue grabs it, Aenier holds on to it for a beat, not letting it go.  "It will only open when the time is right.  This is the most powerful magic I know.  Follow your path, seek to do what is right.  And your group will see days upon days."  He smiles and releases the scroll.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue bows reverently and accepts the scroll with two upturned hands.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Aeneir leads the trio back out of the room, into the hall and past a couple more closed doors until they reach a hallway moving south and grading up.  "Take this way through the mountain.  It will twist and lead up, eventually ending in a door.  This will lead you to the lowest level of the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  Good luck, and may the gods bless you all."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks deep into Æneìr’s eyes and sees the countless ages told there in every freckle of the iris, the darkest depth of his pupils. </p><p></p><p>“Until we meet again, Master Æneìr.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Can’t resist the special/accent characters lol and now it autocorrects to that haha)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(So Torn between upgrading cure to be a BA or something deepsier like making guiding bolt a BA.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cure feels like, meh I could just use healing word, but healing word is only good because it’s a BA. Would be nice to just have one spell to take care of both, but the idea that you could guiding bolt and then attack with adv on same turn is sick as well.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Up to you, good sir!  Lots of options with that one 😃)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Guiding bolt seems like more fun! I’m gonna do it)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They walk on down the hall</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Works been ramping up...  might be a bit before I can continue on, but I'll get back to it as soon as I can!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! Busy over here anyway!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
The group moves into the corridor, watched by a smiling mage.  After some looking back and waving, the party moves beyond visual of the legend and starts to make their way up the long, claustrophobic corridor, towards their long-awaited goal.  The heat is intense for some time, especially since they had been resting in an air-conditioned room for a time.  It evens out soon enough, however, as the passage starts to climb.  Several portions actually are carved into short flights of stairs, and there are many cut-backs and turns throughout their journey.  It widens out at a point, also, where the trio can walk side-by-side.  

After long trek, always moving forward and up, the adventurers finally make it to an icy covered floor which leads into a frozen, frost-rimed room.  In front of them is an enormous block of ice, on which is carved: *For those who wish to proceed, know this - the tests are for the true heir.  None but they shall pass through.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Below the writing, carved in the ice, is a dragon mark.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Roll20 is updated!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hey brother, hope the move is going well!  I've been getting things together for Monday and for continuing this story, so I apologize about the lack of posts.  Feel free to pick it up when you can, no rush.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(No worries! The place is coming together. What an embarrassment of “things” we have! Sooo many boxes. Really stoked for this part!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mage casts a couple of furtive sideways glances at the sisters and moves closer to investigate the sigil more closely.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Investigation check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally understand too many 'things'!  Still have a basement to liquidate of too many 'things'!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The dragon mark looks to be a signature, the same as the one on the giant gate below.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This, but more blue and white and frosty!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There is a hallway with stairs leading down to the south; all of the steps and walkways seem to be either ice blocks or stone iced-over stone.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Are everyone’s boots secure? Come, follow me as far as this the place will allow.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leads them South down the corridor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The women nod quietly to Maouelue and follow.  Thirty feet S the hall opens up on the left (E) into a large, circular room.  In the center is another large brick of solid ice, but there looks to be something inside of this one.  It's in the center of the room, on a small island connected to the outer walkway by a wooden bridge.  The water around it sloshes as if there was a current or something underneath the surface causing it to move with a current.  The room is lined with bookshelves, completely filled to the brim. They all are iced in place, however.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>There are three halls branching from the outer circle - two to the NE, one directly S.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao raises a hand to the ladies to hold their position, then sets a tentative foot out on the bridge, testing its surface before moving fully across.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It holds, but there is movement in the waters underneath the mage.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He sends Fammy down for a flying lap around the water as he takes a step back.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Fammy's the frog, correct?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I forget. I was thinking Hawk still for now.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Maybe Fammy was the bat?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(So, you want him to skim the water, flying over it, right?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ya. Say 5ft above it.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Arcana check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>🤮</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, he killed Kenny!!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(You bastards!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's bat flies out to scope the area.  It's not very big and the bat makes quick work of it.  It's definitely a magical water, as it's not frozen, however not much more can be gleaned.  As it's making a last pass, a tentacle shoots out of the liquid and snatches it out of the air, and brings it below the surface.  At that moment, Maouelue loses connection with his familiar.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dinner!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks at the water below with concern and sends a cursory ice blast down to roil its surface.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A freezing cold blast hits the surface - and is absorbed into the liquid.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmm...here we go again...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue reaches out to the water with his feelings and begins to weave... </p><p>[Shape Water]</p><p></p><p>He takes a portion of the water below and forms it into a shroud of ice spikes hovering the surface below him as he walks across the bridge.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue reaches for the 'water', he finds he's unable to grasp it.  It feels like liquid to the touch, but he is unable to form it through magic or take away any in cupped hands.  His hands are completely dry when lifted out of the liquid, too.  (Dex save, please!)</p>

The solid block of ice is over six feet tall, four feet wide, and about as much deep...  and has something inside.  Maouelue looks with several vantage points and a picture is put together.  A humanoid is frozen in the middle of the block of ice.  As the mage peers closer, words begin to etch themselves into the front of the ice block:
*Peer into the liquid and see what lies below.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage resigns himself. </p><p>“Alright...I guess I’ll have to do this the old fashioned way...”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks down in the water to find a trace of the beast lurking within.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The eladrin longbow is drawn.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The pool is warm to the touch.  As Maouelue peers into the depths, fathoms appear before him.   It is impossibly deep, and, at the bottom, a massive beast circles the pool.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Seconds feel like minutes as he watches the ominously graceful monster maneuver what for it is a small space.  Suddenly, red eyes, three stacked on top of each other, snap up towards the Dragon Mage.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It swims, cautiously, towards the surface.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The humongous creature hovers mere feet from Maouelue, red eyes darting hither and yon, not seeming to focus on anything.  Then, they snap forward, freezing the interloper where he is.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Telepathically, it says to Maouelue, <i>"Am I not the most impressive, the most powerful and magnificent creature in all the worlds?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“You are not.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“That honor lies with the Platinum.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Deep within your mind, hidden away for some time, you hear purring of an ancient dragon who is well pleased.</p><p>With the first word, the beast begins to open its mouth.  But with the second, it cocks its head and its body twists oddly.  With the last, it blinks.  Maouelue gets the feeling that, if it could smile, it would.  Then, it disappears from the liquid, fading away into particles.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Hmph...well then...<i>very impressive...</i>”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As Maouelue raises from the pool, Bellatrix touches him on the shoulder to make sure he's okay.  "Whatever you did, it must have worked.  The doorways all...  flashed.  Wouldn't have like to see what might have happened if we tried to go through without...   whatever it is you did."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Praise Bahamut.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go left...”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trio move off back across the bridge and around the circle, heading for the northern-most exit.  A sharp right (N) turn leads the friends down a short flight of icy stairs and into a very large room.  At the far end of the room (in the W) stands another large brick of ice, the same dimensions as the other.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Mao once again raises a hand to the ladies and steps forward, what with being a...what was it again? Tenir? Maouleue couldn’t remember, but at any rate he <i>feels</i> like a chosen one.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He leans in close to the ice and inspects it all round.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
It looks exactly the same as the other - a little over six foot, four square on the sides.  It also holds a humanoid inside.  As with the other, writing appears on the front: *Place your hand for the next test.*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao doffs his gauntlets and reaches out, touching faith.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The others as well?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(The ladies are back not touching faith. )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue's hand rests on the ice block for a beat, enough time for him to notice that it is slightly warmer than the rest of the room around him.  Suddenly, he is transported to a small, sunlight-strewn room reminiscent of a green-house.  A variety of plants adorn the room, and the colors range through the rainbow, showering the room in brilliance.  Directly in front of Maouelue, a small table holds a very unique plant.  It is potted and just starting to grow, and has a small purple bulb at it's top.  Two small barrels are next to it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue begins by inspecting the lot of plants around before honing in on the contents of the barrels and the plant in the place of honor. </p><p>“What m mysteries lie below this frozen fortress! I wonder if there are more writings in here?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard moves cautiously through the flowering plants, curious and calculating.  Multi-hued roses bloom, hydrangea, gardenia, hyacinth, iris, lily...  all full and exploding in color.  Quite a contrast from the slate blue-grey-white of the ice palace.  As he meanders and approaches the small table, the purple petal atop the newly-sprouted plant opens.  As it blooms, it shows that it has facial features.  The mouth opens to say, in a high, quiet voice, "Welcome traveler.  There are two barrels of magical sap next to my table.  Feed me and I shall grow."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue obliges.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How would Maouelue like to go about it?  The casks are sealed.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He inspects the cask on the left first, checking for how the lid opens, pulling out his dagger to pry if needed.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The cask is sealed tightly, but Maouelue can take some time to look at it and pry off the lid.  Inside is a deep blue, viscous liquid.  Looking around, there is nothing to transfer the sap to the plant, however.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He also attempts to open the second one the same way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The second opens, the same blue liquid, just less of it.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How do you take your feeding, ser plant?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"That is up to you, saer mage," it says cryptically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes out his small knife and dips it into the container on the right, pulling up the viscous sap and proceeds to drop some, like so much honey, onto the soil around the plant.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Slowly, drop by drop, Maouelue feeds the strange plant.  With each drop, the stalk reaches to higher, the purple petals grow a deeper hue.  Eventually, it looks fully developed, healthy and beaming.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, wizard."  Two seeds then sprout from under on of the leaves, and it continues, "One is for you, one is to plant.  Use them wisely."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Thank you, most gracious and well-spoken of flora. Pray tell me, would you like to join your cohort on the sides of this room? I could give your offspring a head start here in this most fertile of soils."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It bows to Maouelue, and raises its 'face' to his.  "Thank you, kind saer.  But I believe I would like to stretch my legs myself."  </p><p></p><p>The dirt starts shifting and Maouelue sees two root-legs come out and breech over the pot's edge.  They land on the table, and with a large, full-bodied stretch, the small plant takes a couple steps and hops down off the table to meander itself among its brethren.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Will these marvels never cease!" Maouelue jests to himself. He begins to plant the second seed and calls out to the plant, "If I may, what are you called, master plant?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nature check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Although Maouelue is fairly knowledgeable about nature and even arcane-based flora and fauna, this one puzzles him.  He remembers reading, some time ago, about a species of sentient tree-folk, but the name and exact details of it escape him. </p><p></p><p>"Call me sapling, dear mage.  Once I mature past my smallest stage, I will know a proper name and my place in...  whiche'er world I shall be a part of.  For now...  I am just...  sapling."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Very well, sapling, I shall do so. Do you have a regular "gardener" in this place?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"The Prince comes every now and again, but he does not tend my family or I.  He is not allowed.  Only the seekers shall tend and reap the rewards...  or despoil us and be punished."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks around for a moment, considering just how many "seekers" there might be. </p><p></p><p>"One more thing before I part...May I take some of this sap to nurture this seed, or am I to be left to my own for such a thing?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sapling turns to Maouelue and smiles.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first to ask.  Absolutely you may.  And may the Earth Mother bless you and the seed you shall plant."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Bless you and your brethren. My kind has a fondness for all things that grow. May the sun rise to meet you and your harvest be bountiful." With this, the mage takes out the emptied superior potion of healing jar and rinses it with a bit of water from his skin, then dips it delicately into the sap. He takes one last look at sapling before nodding reverently and walks back south to rejoin the other, stowing his valuable seed safely in his pack on the way.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As he walks towards the end of the room, the garden evaporates behind him and his cohorts come into view again.  Maouelue is back in the room with the ice block, staring at a stunned Bellatrix and Benna.</p><p></p><p>"You just disappeared!  Then you were back, an instant later!  This is a strange place indeed."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How are the new digs, by the way?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It's a fortress of filled boxes! Haha, it's great. We are alternating between elation and panic 🙂 so all is normal.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally normal.  Kids having a good time getting their room/s together?  That was always my favorite part!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"An <i>instant</i> you say? Curious indeed. Dear disappeared Daran did tell us about the wiles of time in this place... Let us just say, that I think I've passed the first test. Let us move on, counterclockwise."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, the kids room is looking good. They've each got their own bookshelf. We're getting Cate's brothers' old bunk bed in the next few weeks here too.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Nice!  They're going to LOVE that!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The trio exits the room, retraces their steps back to the wooden bridge, then S to the exit there.  They continue into a small, cold room, with hallways moving off to their left and right (E and W).  Maouelue can see the E hall opens into a pool of liquid, rectangular this time.  The W room has odd angles and a further exit can be seen on the far wall.  (Roll20 updated.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue moves left down the East hallway to the pool and sets about inspecting it.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is a decent size, rectangular, and very, very cold.   There are motes rising up from the pool, which has been completely iced over.  From the ceiling hang dangerous icicles.  Frost and ice slicks spatter the walls here, as if water had been flung at it and it froze instantly.  Even with all of the warm weather gear, Maouelue's bones ache and he can hear the women's teeth chattering loudly behind him.  As he peers into the frozen waters (definitely frozen and not like the arcane liquid in the circular room), he sees something frozen in the pool...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ice crackles a bit as Maouelue is looking through the frosted surface.  There seems to be a pulsing happening deep within the pool.  As he watches, a shimmer seems to ripple at the very bottom.  Moving his head makes the shimmer move throughout the pool itself.  Then it hits him...  he's looking at dragon scales.  Shimmering with the light of Bellatrix's torch.  Benna gasps, Bellatrix nearly drops the light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maoulue takes note of this and beckons the ladies back out of the hall. "Stay here at the crossing," He says plainly before moving West to inspect the other chamber.</p>

<p>Maouelue inspects the Western room, and as soon as he enters, he sees a statue of an enormous creature, frozen in place, along the northern wall.  It's actually frozen <i>into</i> the wall, become a part of it somehow.  The odd appendages and legs meld into the ice and seem to flow from the being, giving it a melted, grotesque quality.  Where it's not melded into the wall, Maouelue can see the creature's features fairly plainly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He casts a few cursory investigatory glances around the other three quadrants of the room including the West corridor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Further in, the W corridor bend N and continues down a long stretch which ends with another ice block, similar to the ones seen before.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Lining the wall in the middle section, are suits of armor, icicles hanging from sections.  But their silver sheen doesn't seem diminished from being in the frozen environment.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The Metal Mage meanders by his mirrored mannequins and musters up to the molded mass in the middle.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He looks for the now-expected writing on the ice block.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the metal mage meanders past the armor...  he hears a loud <i>craaaack</i> of ice breaking loose of cold metal.  Looking behind him, a lone suit of armor steps down from it's dais, red flames appear where it's eyes should be, and it raises it's great sword to attack!</p>

The wretched husk of silver, now dented, lies completely broken on the cold ice floor.  The mage now notices the other cutaways in the hall also have the horrors, but they are not yet animated.

The ice block stands at the farther end of the hall.  It is, again, the same as the others, right down to the placid humanoid in the center.  The etching comes up again: *Place your hand to move beyond.*

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue is whisked away to a vast, open field of grass.  In front of him is a giant wall, over eight feet tall.  Just in front of the wall are five beings, what looks to be a dwarf, a halfling, a gnome, a human, and a dragonborn.  The dragonborn can reach up and touch the top of the wall, while the gnome is well away from the top.  There are shouts coming from the other side of the wall, clamoring for aid.  The five are in a frenzy about how to scale the wall.  The halfling sees you, runs over, and says, <i>"Hey mister, we're sure glad to see you.  Our families are on the other side of that wall, we need to get to them quick - do you think you can help us?"</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Dragonborn, you flank the wall, followed by the human; forgive me, I do not yet know your names, but we can deal with the pleasantries later. Master dwarf, you come next followed by the halfling and gnome respectively. Thus you shall form the fellowship of the staircase and scale yourselves up. Human, toss the dwarf if you have to, dragonborn, cradle your hands as a step and your shoulders to boot. The lot of you should be able to hoist the dragonborn thereafter, and if naught else I can provide a push. May these tactics lead you to those who call for aid, and may you provide it well and willingly.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yikes!  Amen to that!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group does as you say, lining up against the wall.  (Mechanics - group strength checks for everyone to get up and over, then to pull the dragonborn up.  Soo...)</p><p></p><p>The gnome gets up on everyone easily enough.  The halfling is nimble enough to get up on the wall without too much aid as well.  The dwarf, however...  is a bit heftier!  </p><p>(First strength check is for the dwarf getting pulled/pushed up the humanoid stairs.  3 rolls, please!)</p>

<p>Everyone strains and tries as much as they possibly can, but nobody can lift the dwarf.  You see that, after a certain number of tries, the people fade away.  A few moments later, they reappear, huddled in a circle, discussing how to get over the wall.  The halfling notices you, comes over and says, "Hey mister..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just back from being soccer dad. I’ve got some in me tonight after bed time if you do.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue chuckles to himself, “Alright, let’s see here...” He takes a closer look at the construction of the wall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's just a wall.  Too tall for a single person to get over, but just a standard stone wall.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(What is the condition of the soil?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Normal soil.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not sandy or anything.  No clay below the surface so it can be dug or shaped, if that's what you're wondering.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Let us see, do you lot remember me from before?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue gets blank stares.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sounds like a plan, brother!!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Right then...Master dwarf, how high can you jump?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He jumps and gets about a foot off the ground.  Then shrugs, comically.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Right...this will take a little time, but we'll get it sorted out."</p><p>[Rest to prepare a spell?]</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With the boots and the spell, the dwarf jumps straight up to the wall and lands...</p>

<p>Somewhat gracefully at the top.  His left boot hits the edge, he slips... but catches himself at the last to kneel firmly on the top of the wall.  He reaches down and starts helping the others up again.  Soon it comes down to the human and the dragonborn.  (Plan for getting them over?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(sorry work blowing up)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Not a problem, got the same thing over here!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I was thinking about repeating the jump move, but can try other stuff if that's too lame 🙂 )</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Yeah, no worries.  You don't have to impress anyone!!)</p><p>(Are you casting jump on everyone else?  Yourself as well?)</p>

<p>"Ok now, lets pass those boots down!"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Just on the human and DB. Theyll trade boots assuming they make it up. I've got a failsafe if they don't)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We'll say the human and the dwarf were able to attune in the time allotted, but the dragonborn was not.  However, with that jump, he's able to scale it perfectly, using very little strength to get up.  If you want to give me two d20 rolls for strength, the DC is 4 for both.)</p>

<p>The human takes a running jump, but can't get the depth down and crashes into the fall, falling over.  The dragonborn ups just fine, putting his hand down for the human.  The human stands, shakes itself off, and tries again...</p>

<p>The human jumps, but the boots are tied together, and he trips again.  The dwarf misses him, but the dragonborn grabs his arm and pulls him up.  (Maouelue's turn!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a hefty <i>sproing</i>, the metal mage makes it to the very edge of the top of the wall.  The dwarf stabilizes him and the group now looks out over yet another vast field of blackness.  The world seemingly ends here.  One by one, the people jump down into the blackness and disappear.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well blimey... what an odd sort of place this is..." He looks behind himself again, back down the grassy side to regain his bearings.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The wizard jumps into  the void.  As the blackness envelopes him, it morphs and he feels himself floating through space.  A hazy blueness starts as a pinpoint of light, widens out to encompass his vision entirely, then focuses into the large block of ice with the person inside.  The giant elk nudges the newly re-appeared man, while the boots Maouelue had lent to the small group are waiting for him atop the cold block in front of him.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sounds of dripping can be heard from somewhere in the corridors connected to this room, echoing off the frosted walls.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(afk lunch)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well Elkamigo...I dropped off that great wall, came unglued, fell into a deep well, and landed to reform here, <i>and</i> I took care of my shoes! Not bad for a moment's end I'd say!"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
Elkamigo: "..."

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I see... you're just staring at your walls..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"But hark! Do I hear echoing footfalls? Or is that just the mire of the cavern? Let me sling up my baskets and we'll ride back down the line."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Elkamigo chortles something sounding suspiciously like "Do what you gotta jiboo."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Love it!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Maouelue and Elkamigo look S towards the rooms opening, but nothing presents itself with the exception of the echoing dripping.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>They ride South and Mao pulls the reigns up just as they start, thinking to take a closer look at these suits of armor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Perception for a quick look, Investigation for a closer one, please!)</p>
