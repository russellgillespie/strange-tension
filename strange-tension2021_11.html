<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-1"><p>The motley crew of a road-hardened druid, a grimy noble-cum-fighter, an odd amalgamation of a dragon and an illithid, and a giant snail make their way through the torch-lit hallway.  Closer and closer the mumbling comes.  The door is halfway open, and just from the opening, Dieter can make out a cozy room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bookshelves line the walls, most are overflowing with scrolls and parchment.  A large light source seems to be coming from just beyond the door, as is the mumbling.  Wet, gurgling mumbles emanate from the space in the room no one can see.  Flaco gets more and more animated as the group closes in on the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A ghostly voice passes by Dieter's ear, riding a cold breeze.  "Yesss...  this way, druid.  My final resting place is close..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter shudders but heeds the call and moves to follow, his hand at the ready on his bladestaff.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter grips the Annilus hard and grits his teeth as this invasive voice probes his mind, willing it out of his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The voice becomes a trickle then a whisper as it is forced from Dieter's mind altogether.  Surprise tinges the illithid's face as it feels this too.  He floats-rises to standing beside his contained ritual fire.  Pointing at the newcomers, he hisses through tentacled facial appendages and it's hands are wreathed in a purple-blue light.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob, coming to himself after that harrowing fight, touches his head.  Directly in the center of his forehead, a rough edged hole about an inch in diameter, is trickling blood down his face.  He smears is a bit, then falls back prone and lets out a long shaky breath.  </p><p></p><p>Dieter, with a quick glance, can tell this is a ritual room, and one was broken up just as the adventurers got there.  The words and symbols don't mean a lot, but they look Iliithi in nature.  Scattered books and papers are strewn about, but most are written with such a hasty scrawling hand, nothing of note can be gleaned. There are four doors, one in each corner of the room.  (All are closed, the fire is near embers now, but there is a small pile of sticks and tinder next to the papers.  Behind you, the hallway has two branching lines to the W - or your right.  There are three doors that way, two on the left and one on the right.)</p></div>
