<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The motley crew of a road-hardened druid, a grimy noble-cum-fighter, an odd amalgamation of a dragon and an illithid, and a giant snail make their way through the torch-lit hallway.  Closer and closer the mumbling comes.  The door is halfway open, and just from the opening, Dieter can make out a cozy room.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bookshelves line the walls, most are overflowing with scrolls and parchment.  A large light source seems to be coming from just beyond the door, as is the mumbling.  Wet, gurgling mumbles emanate from the space in the room no one can see.  Flaco gets more and more animated as the group closes in on the door.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A ghostly voice passes by Dieter's ear, riding a cold breeze.  "Yesss...  this way, druid.  My final resting place is close..."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter shudders but heeds the call and moves to follow, his hand at the ready on his bladestaff.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
Flayco calms with a look from Dieter.  With a hand on the door, the druid pushes it open more.  An inch, then two, no sound comes from the room save for the seemingly ritualistic muttering.   Then...
*Schrrrreeeeeech*

The rusty hinge betrays the group.  

But not before the illithid looks up from the fire blazing in the center of the room.  With a sick slurping sound, the creature speaks in some strange language, and in Dieter's mind, he hears: *"WHY DO YOU DISTURB ME?"*

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter grips the Annilus hard and grits his teeth as this invasive voice probes his mind, willing it out of his head.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voice becomes a trickle then a whisper as it is forced from Dieter's mind altogether.  Surprise tinges the illithid's face as it feels this too.  He floats-rises to standing beside his contained ritual fire.  Pointing at the newcomers, he hisses through tentacled facial appendages and it's hands are wreathed in a purple-blue light.</p>

Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.

<p>Jaecob, coming to himself after that harrowing fight, touches his head.  Directly in the center of his forehead, a rough edged hole about an inch in diameter, is trickling blood down his face.  He smears is a bit, then falls back prone and lets out a long shaky breath.  </p><p></p><p>Dieter, with a quick glance, can tell this is a ritual room, and one was broken up just as the adventurers got there.  The words and symbols don't mean a lot, but they look Iliithi in nature.  Scattered books and papers are strewn about, but most are written with such a hasty scrawling hand, nothing of note can be gleaned. There are four doors, one in each corner of the room.  (All are closed, the fire is near embers now, but there is a small pile of sticks and tinder next to the papers.  Behind you, the hallway has two branching lines to the W - or your right.  There are three doors that way, two on the left and one on the right.)</p>
