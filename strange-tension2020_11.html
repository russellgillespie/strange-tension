<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-0"><p><i>The march of the heavy plate echoing off the walls mingles with the illusion of a shimmering hum emanating from the Dragon Mage. The image of justice presses on unwaveringly to the lair of evil serpents.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, having had a moment now to absorb this change in his companion, begins to feel bolstered by this confident crusade. Since his last musings on the mirror, he felt empowered having a point of focus foe the battle in front of him...one for whom he wouldn’t have to bear the soulful burden of summoning. In a tight spot, Dieter knew deep down he would be happy to see the countrymen again, but for now he would use the shadow cast by his radiant friend to obfuscate his approaches and gain his advantage. It’s time now to serve the serpents a certain serenity.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two friends and their newfound companion gather their belongings and head towards where Frume said the lair entrance was.  The party moves through the cave into a spacious tunnel, and along the passage until it opens further into a cul-de-sac of sorts. Moving slower and slower as you approach, you can see figures guarding something at the very end of the cavern.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The party moves further in the cavern and is able to glean a few things.  Firstly, there are no exits save from whence they came.  There are four serpent beings milling about the front of a door, framed and made of stone.  Maouelue can see that there are bodies on the ground, a couple of the snake-beings are tending to them.  They're just off to the side of the door.  Lastly, the wizard sees that the door is odd in the sense that it doesn't have a handle or any other obvious way to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue whispers a few words to Dieter, the Druid’s eyes widen, the narrow and harden in assent.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out his waterskin and draws forth a single drop. He begins speaking, his words sounding like waves crashing upon the shore, his hands pushing and pulling the drop as bread being kneaded and stretched.

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume's eyes go wide at the magical display he just witnessed.  He tries to hide behind a big rock, seeing the lizards on the ground, head reeling, slings a shot quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard can tell the beings on the ground are doing <i>very</i> badly.  Frume already killed one with a bolt.  There is one standing that looks fairly healthy, considering.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue strides forward, he pulls out a small piece of parchment on which he has scribbled a dragon. Speaking to it, it begins to spread around him in a golden aura.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The one remaining lizard person on the ground looks around at their frozen and pierced comrades, struggles to get up on their feet, and loads their range weapon...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He sees all three of you, decides to take a shot at... [1 Mao, 2 Dieter, 3 Frume]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And it tries to run backwards to hide near the door...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Slips a bit, doesn't get far.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is one lizard person on the party's left side that is looking fairly hale.  It screeches, rattles something in it's throat (I'm hearing something like the raptors from JP) and takes a shot with their range weapon as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It hisses and moves to hide amongst the scree in the far side of the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter touches his ring and goes invisible, moving around to the left of the tunnel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seeing the thing's arrow hit Dieter hard, Frume starts to go check on the man.  However, he goes invisible just as Frume steps forward.  Shaking his head at the magical wonders that never cease, he peers through the darkness to try and spot the lizard-person that snuck away...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And sees it...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume smiles when he hears the bolt hit home, then backs toward the guys to see if he can help them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue continues his steadfast march toward the serpents, his pace slowed, but his conviction not so weighed. He lets out another frosty advance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snake-person takes the ray of frost to the it's back, knocking him down to a knee.  It is nearly frozen, the cold all around it affecting his cold, cold blood...  It tries to reach around with it's bow, possibly for the last time.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow bounces off the cavern wall, the serpent hisses in pain and frustration.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other serpent, seeing it's last remaining member fall, makes a dash to the door.  It hisses in it's own language, saying something serpent-esque, and the door cracks open slightly.  He makes to open it.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Effect invisible removed from Dieter Deleter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frume is getting closer to Maouelue, he starts to ask if anyone needs help...  And a bear erupts from absolutely nowhere and charges the lizard-person!  Taken aback, not wanting to shoot <i>at</i> the bear, he aims for the fallen lizard-person.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at the crossbow in astonishment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue walks up to the first snake creature and raises a haled blade...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Upon striking the beast dead with a flash of steel, the Dragon Mage begins to dissolve into a silvery mist. A faint shimmering sound as he reappears in front of the fleeing serpent. A cold shake of the frostbitten helm denies the snake its passage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The serpent sneers at the <i>heavily</i> armored man.  It tries to shove you in and shut the door!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snake-man makes to leap over you...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume and Dieter see the door shut as the snake-person pushes a monolithic Maouelue backwards into the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>At the last second, the Dragon Mage brings his blade up.  The serpent snags its leg on the blade, causing it to fall into the wizard.  The two sprawl in the entryway of the passage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i> door with his claws and full weight, roaring for his friend.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is going to remove his head wrapping, showing a thick, scraggly plume of brown hair.  He lights a torch and peers at the door.  It looks like a solid piece of stone, there are no seams.  If you hadn't seen the two enter through it, you would have believed it to be an out-of-place piece of stone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Dammit!  They're in there!  One of those damned things said something and it opened.  How are we gonna get in there?  We gotta help your friend!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Both Mao and the serpent come to at the same moment, looking at each other, lying on the cold stone floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls at his blade...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>His arm hangs against a stray whip of the snake's tail and he is put off.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beast is heaving, breathing <i>hard</i>.  It looks like it's hanging on by a thread.  It throws it's head back and makes that same raptor-like call, keeping an eye on you the whole time.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It steels itself to fight!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's lost too much blood.  As it lazily swipes the air, Maouelue can see the fight go out of it's eyes.  It knows it's fate is sealed now.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue looks back at it, a resolute sadness in his eye. There was just too much evil to be allowed to remain in these foul snakes. Yet, he never relished the killing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He begins to raise a hand...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Beater sniffs at the door, trying to see if it reveals the two beyond, perhaps this is some sort of illusion...could their scent pass through stone? How else could the barrier arise so?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bear smells, smells...  the tinge of blood tickle his nose.  It's spicy, with an algae-like tang.  It reeks, but it doesn't give the bear more insight into how to get past the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter begins to try speaking in snakelike tongues to implore the door to open.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter stares at the snakes.  Nothing happens.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter remembers words and phrases in the language of the snake.  He parses some together, using correct diction and phrasing and...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sees a well lit hallway made of the same stone as the door; finely crafted and finished stones.  Torches are inset in wall sconces, their low light seems like the sun in this darkened expanse.  You see Maouelue and the snake-person still locked in combat.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks at the scene and sees Maouelue taking the situation in hand. The druid defers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume shields his eyes from the sudden light source, and yells in, "Oy?  You okay in there?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maoulue raises an icy hand to the serpent's eyes, then sends out a ray or icy energy to finally quell the evil.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Resssst in peaccce"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three of you take time to search the bodies of the snake-people.  There are decently made scimitars, two on each body.  They all have shortbows as well, but not finely made.  They collectively have 45 gold, 23 silver on them.  They all wear amulets, gold, worth 1 gp each.  The design is a snake head with it's mouth opened, tongue flicking out.  (History checks for symbol, perception checks for the hallway.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group can't quite lock on to the history of the symbol.  Dieter recalls it belonging to an ancient race of serpents, but the specifics are eluding him.  Maouelue has been in this hall for some time, and he has been soaking up the details.  The torches, oddly, seem recently lit.  There are two doors on the right, two doors on the left, and a large, oaken door at the end of the hall 35 feet away.  The oaken door has a strange looking handle on it.  The ceiling is carved and there are wood beams running lengthwise along the passage.  The doorways on the far end of the two on the right and left sides are bigger and their arches are more ornate.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group takes the money and amulets, but leaves the weapons on the bodies. Maouelue places a silver piece in each of the eight eyes before leaving. They move one door at a time, starting on the first of the left set. The mage tries the handle...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens with a creak.  It pulls open to reveal a small room with a wooden coffin in the middle.  There are no decorations or furnishings other than the coffin.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves in and inspects the coffin looking for any sign of a name or message.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No name or message.  Looks to Maouelue like a pauper's coffin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wood is distressed in places, splintering here and there.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He beckons Dieter to help him lift the lid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lid is nailed down, but the wood is so old the nails don't catch like they once did.  The wizard and the druid are able to get their fingers into crevices and <i>pull</i> up.  The lid lifts off, revealing a clay statue of a snake-warrior, arms crossed over their chest.  A clay depiction of a scimitar is as if it were in the warrior's hip scabbard.  The eyes are gold bits, but they look too small to be standard currency gold pieces.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They lower the lid back down and move across the hall to the opposite door for a similar inspection.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find the exact same thing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Sensing the pattern, the group moves to the back right room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is a larger room that the last, the archway has some words written in snake-ese.  The door pulls open to reveal a coffin, slightly smaller that the other two.  There are reliefs on the walls depicting snake-men using magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two magic users slow and take their time inspecting the reliefs, carefully examining the magical effects being represented.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The depictions are of destruction magics, vile and ancient.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes out his sketchbook and begins drawing a facsimile of the two murals. While the wizard draws his strokes, Dieter has Frumious assist him with the next coffin lid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This statue is smaller and is clothed in what used to be fancy purple robes.  Tatters remain.  The hands are crossed and there is a silver ring on the hand resting on top.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter steps back, considering this a moment while he pulls out a red bottle and pulls the cork with this canines, spitting it into the corner. He lets out a sneering hiss at the statue as he pulls back and lowers the contents down his gullet, wincing slightly and shaking his neck and shoulders.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Still not quite feeling up to his normal vigor, he shudders and whispers a few additional words of healing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A rough grunt escapes the druid, a hint of a growl still on his voice.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue flits around inspecting the finer points of shadow and highlight, his eye is drawn to the silver ring. He sets his drawing down in his pack and moves to it, hovering his palm over it feeling for traces of the arcane.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Oh Bahamut...guide me in my search."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard waves his hand and checks for traces of the arcane, a voice utters deep in his mind.  He cannot understand the words, but they are foreboding, menacing.  Guttural grunts mixed with hisses echo in the man's head.  There is a whisper of common underlying everything, though.  It sounds like "weapon".</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls his palm back, frowning gravely. He then waves the group to the opposite room, leaving this coffin open for the time being.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They proceed across the corridor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room opposite is structured exactly like this one, except for a décor of magic, there is a ambiance of learning and scholar here.  There is a small bookshelf in the corner, all of the items are withered to dust though.  The coffin opens on a smallish serpent-scholar, bedecked in tattered robes of deep blue and silver.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue bends in closer to the serpent scholar looking for any symbols of devotion or knowledge that might have been lain with the form.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's professional curiosity is stoked as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two blink at each other simultaneously.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a serpent eating it's own tail, but there seems to be something else about that symbol.  Neither of you can tell what's odd about it, though.  (Religion check for more info on the symbol)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue takes the point of his blade and begins slicing out the symbol, the tucks it into his book.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid thinks back over his many years of observance for his religion.  Nothing stands out directly, but something about a long-lost or ousted serpentine race once idolized the symbol nags the back of his mind.  Nothing specific comes together for either of the men.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With great care Maouelue slices a thin layer of the clay placing it in between the pages of his diary and closing it hard. He walks back across the hallway and begins to skewer the ring on the tip of his sword.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stands back half amused, half sickened at the sound of echoing metal.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It’s quite a scene to see such a fearsomely clad being taking such gentle care of these idols.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leans back and pops another bottle of red.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The finger comes off along with the ring.  The clay statue was hollow and filled with a poisonous gas.  As the gas seeps out, Maouelue clocks it early and is able to jump out of the room in time.  It dissipates, only delivering one point of damage to the Dragon Mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the group sees a greenish haze filtering out of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue steps out of the room. Heading for the last door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter sees the second bit of poison in as many encounters, he changes out his rings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The oaken door at the end of the hall stands imposing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The troupe now convened at the oaken door, where Maouelue raises the hilt of his sword and bashes it into the center, knocking hard three times.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It sounds loud.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two roguish types pull at the handles instead, shaking their brows mildly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Locked.  (Perception check or strength check to force the door.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ceiling creaks and suddenly <i>cracks</i> releasing the massive wood beam.  It comes barreling down, catching <i>everyone</i> by surprise.  It drives through the party and into the door, smashing it and bringing the whole lot with it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is brought to for a moment, his newfound zeal having gotten the better of him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group is bodily thrown into the next room, they are knocked down prone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the party gets to their feet, they are greeted by another torch-lit room.  It's oval in general shape, 35ft side to side, 20ft deep, with a small alcove to the S  (The door you came through is on the W).  On the N wall are three wooden coffins, similar to the ones you've seen before.  There is a <i>much</i> larger coffin on the S side, just N of the alcove, running W to E lengthwise.  The torches flicker.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue walk over to the three small coffins to inspect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are paintings on these, snake-men-warriors in gentle repose.  The coffins look better made than the ones in the other rooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They open these as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They open onto the same clay statues as the rooms prior.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves over to the large coffin and inspects it while Dieter hangs back.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is a bit more well made, thicker, heavier.  The wood is in better condition.  The picture on t he front is of a huge looking snake-man with a long tail instead of legs, and two massive arms.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The reliefs tell of some battles between an ancient race of serpents called Naga, and their elven, human, and dwarven enemies.  These depictions show the Naga as heroic vanquishers of the humanoid races.  (More in a sec.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the short rest wanes, you receive a rush of emotion as you connect with the silver ring.  It is a device made by the Naga, a weapon of sorts.  If you put it on, you can retain a particular skill the Naga possess.  It would transform a part of your body into a serpent appendage, giving it the ability to deliver poison damage with an unarmed strike.  Maouelue feels dread and a sense of warning, but at the same time, emanating in waves from the object, he feels a great sense of power and righteous anger.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands the ring to Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the ring and turns it over a few times, taking his own read on its energies.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sense you get from the ring, tapping into the Naga-created object, pushing into the understanding of the types of beings these serpents were...  Dieter is pummeled by a barrage of emotion, mainly vengeance.  Anger and pain war within him as he senses the motives of the Naga.  These beings are pure hate and atrocity.  They wanted nothing more to see the world burn and be recreated by their serpent gods.  Magical items they made for themselves are extremely powerful.  Those left for whomever might find them have...  secrets.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gestures to the center of the room. The group makes to gather coffin tops from all the rooms and place them out end to end in a long sort of platform arrangement.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Their lips slaver with red drips.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume opens the door easily.  This is a storage closet.  Ingredients by the crateful are stocked in here.  (Anything you need to stock up on, component-wise, would be in here.  Feel free to rp it!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods and exits a south door, leaving it open.  There are enough ingredients to make about 2d10 standard potions of healing, or 2d4 superior potions of healing.

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group picks up and carries on toward the next door, toward their fate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The team exits the S door, it's already open.  It swings wide into a 5ft wide hallway.  To the party's right there is another solid oaken door, banded with iron, 5ft away.  To their left (E) the corridor continues straight, opening into a vast room with high ceilings (30 ft) and massive pillars.  Just before that room is a hallway to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to open the door.....ON THE RIGHT!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door on  the <i>right</i> opens onto a beautiful golden idol.  Made in a very ornate, flowing design, it depicts one snake, rising into the air, while it's tail curves and wends its way toward the creature's mouth.  It is 10ft tall, what looks to be solid gold, and is positioned on a square onyx base.  (Inspection or perception checks for more!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks at it - looks like a pretty nice statue!  When Maouelue takes a closer inspection, his elven eyes pierce a veil on the idol.  Firstly, the thing is extremely well crafted.  Looks possibly to even be on elvish make.  Second, its a mobius strip oroborous.  However is was constructed, there seems to be only one side to the snake.  Perfectly formed, you marvel at how this was accomplished.  Lastly, you see there are fine gems inset for the eyes.  They burn a bright red-gold in the torchlight.  They are so close in color to the gold, you might have never seen them if you hadn't been inspecting so closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers a moment, then takes the point of his sword and tries to pry the stones out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sword can't catch the edge, he won't be able to pop the stones out like that.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>You could swear you hear a seductive hissing as you shut the door behind you...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party continues and comes to the fork.  There is a hallway to the right.  Maouelue sees, with his dark vision, a thirty foot hallway that ends with another oaken door.  In front of the party, you get a better view of the large room before you.  Besides the pillars, there are many other statues here.  These are not gold, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They turn right toward the door at the end of the hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall trends downward, maybe dipping 5ft in all.  The door at the end of the hall is unlocked.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They go in</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door <i>creaks</i> open, revealing a dark cavern warren.  The walls, ceiling, and ground are all poorly dug out dirt.  Roots and vines twine through all.  There are ratty bags of feathers, rags, bowls of grease, and bat guano covers pretty much everything.  As you take a step in, crunching of small insect shells echo and grate your senses.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes a few feathers and corks another bottle of grease.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The grease smells <i>awful</i>.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They eff back off to the last hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a causeway in the SE corner of the room that lead to more caverns.  One goes E, the other S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take note of this and head back to the the other hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You enter the massive room, torchlight doesn't even reach to the other end nor does it illuminate the ceiling.  Maouelue can see the dimensions of the room, but the bright light is limited.  (Perception or Investigation on anything, let me know!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any sconces or braziers</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are several, all throughout the chamber.  Some still have torches in them, but they look like they've gone to seed.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a look around.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are statues of humanoids, goblins, orcs, a variety of beings littered around the room.  No rhyme or reason, it seems.  The pillars have sculpted snakes running  the length of their 30ft height.  These are very finely crafted.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has a hard time, but Maouelue is totally into it!  (Persuasion to bring Frume along, he's kinda on the fence about it.  The faces look too real...)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hoy, lads...  I don't know about knocking these statues over.  Look at the eyes on this one?!  No way an artist can do this, am I right?!"</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and the mage start setting fire to the clay statues.  It takes a bit to start them up, and Frume is not really taking part in it.  He's going around the room examining the statues and pillars.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Once the blaze begins to feed on itself slowly, the two begin to inspect the rest of the room with Frume.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh gods, are you okay Dieter?!"  He tries to sling another bolt at the creature.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers see the beleaguered man take a deep, deep breath.  Eyes close again and he says, "I've was tracking a group of orcs that attacked a village about a tenday ago.  The village guards put up a fight, but they were really no match for the lot.  I was just coming back to my village from an excursion abroad when I found the people decimated."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I tracked the bastards down, started picking them off one by one.  You should have seen them, they didn't know what the fuck was happening!"  He laughs, joylessly.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A few moments pass, but no explosion happens.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter has been plugging his ears, but doesn’t feel the expected rumble. He peeks around the corner real sneaky like.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing doing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid is intrigued. He decides he had better show the others. He runs to get them and to show a repeat of the trick. This time he stands farther back and watches.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares intently as the firework blast travels down the hallway, waiting...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The firework hit the statue head-on, exploding.  It is a very nice show.  But the statue still stands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter runs up to it and tries to carve at the gold with his blade trying to see if it will peel or dent at all.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It does not.  (Strength check and then Wisdom save for Dieter.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Good rolls!)</p><p>The gold gives under the blade a bit, Dieter feels it give but checks again, it doesn't score at all.  There is a tug at the back of his mind, but it goes away just as quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He says a word in Giant. The word from the other statue above so long ago.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gold glints in the torchlight.  Other than that, nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to turn it on the platform.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue put their backs into it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a few minutes of pushing and pulling, the idol hasn't moved an inch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries to remember a few of the words he uttered to the snake-stone door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Open"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tugging at the back of Dieter's mind turns into a whisper.</p><p></p><p><i>"Why?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"For Briffo."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"I don't know a... Briffo.  I know only Muhlens.  Who are you?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I am the one they call Deleter."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We come on on behalf of the Muhlens"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"My name is Quetza.  I am the keeper of the Muhlens secrets."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hozieh sent us to sspeak with you."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"They have never mentioned a...  Deleter.  Tell me, do you know the key?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reaches in his pocket and pulls out a piece of parchment covered in a circle of runes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>There are many keysss in thiss world ssir.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls out a bottle of the venom.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Which would you have of me?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Am I?  What did you say your name was, again?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“That depends what form I take. If you take my meaning.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Hmmm...  That as may be.  It is true for me as well.  Tell me of Lord Muhlen.  Why has he not been to this altar recently?"</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“At last we come to the end of the riddles and get down to the tidings I would bear...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Lord Muhlen...has perished. The citizens of Oakhurst formed a fanatical brotherhood and have ssecretly taken the Lord from usss. While the daughterss sseek vengeance, I have been ssent to sseek your counssel...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>"Very well.  You may recieve my counsel after you pass this tesssstttt..."</i>  </p><p>The voice fades and a small opening morphs into the center of the statue.  What looks like now molten gold ripples throughout the statue.  It seems something is to be presented.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The heroes turn their heads toward each other and smirk, tilting their necks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks on over your shoulders, curious.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the Staff of Baobab and inserts it into the the golden solar plexus.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks at Maouelue</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“The things I do for Life...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter moves to insert the stalk of the staff into the beckoning golden space.  Just as it is about to break the surface of the statue, Frume reaches out a hand and stays Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man looks deathly serious now.  With his right hand on Dieter's arm, he reaches and inserts his left hand into the hole in the statue.  (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is surprised by the turn of events, he misses it completely...  but Dieter's eyes see a glint of metal on the man's left hand just as it dives into the hole.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The metal pools around Frume's hand, locking him in place.  </p><p>A silent scream appears on his face.</p><p>An eerie moment passes, then the fighter drops to his knees and lets forth the pained yell.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The silence is broken by the sound of terrible anguish.  Blood chills as Frume starts trying to pull back from the statue but cannot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees the fighter’s precarious predicament and prepares to placate the situation, placing his blade along the man’s wrist...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue goes to strike!  He raises his blade in the air.  As it comes down...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume falls back to the floor, the blade <i>swishes</i> through empty air.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man's hand has been cauterized, the entire wrist-nub is pinkish red scar tissue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is lying on the ground, hugging his arm to his chest.  He rocks back and forth, cradling it and saying, "No, no, no, no..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You hear a disembodied voice say (in everyone's mind), "Your payment was accepted."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A small chamber on the front of the onyx base opens with a <i>puff</i> and a small drawer is revealed.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue inspects the drawer.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A book is the only thing in the drawer.  It is well made, bound in a strange type of thinnish, padded leather.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage reaches in and grabs it gently, pulling it up to inspect it more closely.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peers at the journal, mildly peeved at the wizard for just grabbing it first...wasn’t he the one that was infatuated?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s tongue flicks out in anticipation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's mind is taken away to a room...  a familiar room filled with foreign, magical books and chests with hidden treasures.  At an ornate desk, a gray-haired man sits, writing.  The book is the same as the one Maouelue holds.  Words are being poured over and transcribed into the tome.  Time progresses.  Maouelue sees the elder mage return time and again to the book.  Finally, with a heavy <i>thump</i> the gray-haired mage, looking much older, shuts it an gives it a pat.  The mage calls out of the room.  Two young women answer the call.  The mage ushers them in a shuts the large doors.  In an instant his features turn serpentine, and the two girls react in terror.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He calms the two young ones, lets them see he means them no harm.  He shows them the book he's been working diligently on.  Time progresses more.  As the old man gets older, the two women grow.  Eventually the old man does not show up again and the two women are the only ones using the book.  As the time slows, giving Maouelue the feeling of finality, he sees one of the women steal into the room, grab the book, and retreat down a hidden ladder in the floor.  The other comes in moments later, chasing her.  The vision fades and Maouelue is standing, staring at words of a mage, surging green in the torchlight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Some words are able to be read, some are in a language he cannot understand.  A portion of the tome reads as a diary, expressing the mage's struggles with deciphering the Netherese books he's found.   Another portion of the book contains translations, or approximations, of several Netherese texts.  Lastly, there are several spells the mage seemed to be working with.  It is almost as if the mage was reverse engineering spells based on the information he was gleaning.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes the time and stows it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head back now to the way beyond the lord of stools.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party starts to move out of the hallway back to the goblin warren.  Frume is having some trouble getting up, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Here, take this...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands him a standard shield. Hopefully the fighter can at least wield that...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at it, wincing.  "No.  I... ah...  I don't that'll do, lad.  Might be needing to find another home for me other sword, p'haps."  How holds his stump up to the torchlight to examine it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  I'll take what I can get.  I in the meantime... you lead the way, gentlemen."   He tries at a smile.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the two sort out the equipment, Maouelue walks in down the hall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a sorrowful look, he awkwardly reaches into his right scabbard with his right hand and pulls out...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks Frumious dead in the eyes and says,</i> “I will hold this for you until you can hold it again. We will not give up on your recovery. We must go now. “</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the party makes its way through goblin warrens, you peek into the room you missed on the right the first time you passed by.  Dieter sticks his head in.  This room tapers to the back wall and the corners.  It is littered with dung, egg shells, and noxious fumes.  The floor is a viscous mud/dung mix.  He doesn't see anything or anyone in the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party passes through the remains of the fireworks room and into the cavern of the goblin wallower.  The thing takes up a good portion of the room, however it doesn't look to be interested in any of the members of your team.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They leave the goblin to his moping and carry on to the SE passage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Mao hurls into the stew of filth.  The goblin lets out a deep, burbling laugh.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue spits and wipes his mouth, swishing a drag of water from his skin then spitting again.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They pick up the pace, a bit of frenzy taking over the group.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group moves down the narrow hall.  Five feet in...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees an arrow fly though the air at him and lodge itself in the clay wall to his right.  Grunts and words in the goblin tongue can be heard from around the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid touches his ring and fades...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s hand glows blue...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Neither Maouelue nor Dieter can see the goblins at this time.  Looks like they're waiting around the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sneaks up at the corner and sees three goblins waiting for the group to breech the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All three have their shortbows up and ready.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries to use his invisibility to sneak behind them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stays back a moment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin is sliced in twain and doesn't even realize it.  The top half slides off slowly, and while the arrow is still nocked, the goblin splits and the two halves fall away.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite, I can't use my FUCKING crossbow!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin looks around for an exit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Don’t run.“</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid goes invisible again and the patter of his feet lead down the hall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The metal mage manages his movement in a measured manner making motions merely mimicking more mobile mates.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[75 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue never hesitates to enter the aenima...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They each quaff as they go.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group clears the area.  Noticing a hallway ending in a large oak door, Maouelue leads the team toward it.  (Perception check from Mao, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door is locked but not trapped.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They leave the door for now and head back around the hallway.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tunnel twists around and ends in a wall.  There is an iron ring jutting out from the middle of the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard gives it a cursory tug as Dieter backs up a pace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens, with some effort.  Scraping of stone-on-stone echoes in the pillar room.  The stone people and basilisks are still holding their positions.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group scours the area looking for a key.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The adventurers look around, no one can find anything that looks like a key.  There are some goblin prints that were not there previous, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They whisper to each other and making a plan to split up and move around the circle. The invisible druid will go through the statue chamber and back around. The wizard and the injured man will go past fungal goblin King.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter finds something that could be a key?  Frume is no help at all.  Maouelue, as he's moving through the muck near the golblin king, steps on something odd.  He feels it with the toe of his boot.  It has the shape of what he's looking for...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage sifts through the slop and comes up with a tarnished iron key.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He heads around to the door and tells us to go find the druid.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter finds the other two and holds out a bone that has been chiseled and whittled to look like a key.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizards stares bewildered at the druid, chuckling about the bone key in his hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Turns to the door and then search the iron key into the lock, twisting.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens smoothly, opening onto a domed hall.  Three doors exit from this room on the N, E, and S.  The S door is very elaborate, iron-wrought, with an odd keyhole in it's center.  There is a broken wooden door to the E.  To the N, an opaquely transparent barrier presents itself, the flicker of orange flames beckon beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head east to the mundane door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group enters the E door.  A short hall leads to a very warm room filled with a sour smell.  Manacles are screwed into the walls, several sets of them.  Blood of various hues color the floor.  As Frume nears one set of manacles...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bracelet section of one levitates and tries to clamp itself on him!  He deftly dodges, but everyone notices the manacles closest to the group start trying to latch themselves onto the heroes!  (Dex saves!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage dodges away as one comes near.  Just as Frume and the wizard move toward the exit at the N wall of the room, Dieter's arm and leg feel the manacles attach!</p><p>(Dex save again for Dieter!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The druid is able to avoid having another manacles clamp down, but the others are still holding him back.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter yanks back on the manacles, he pulls them taut, stretching their links across the room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls his sword from it's scabbard and slashes down hard across them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue slices through the arm chains, causing a spark of blue to emit from the chains.  It falls to the ground and does not attack again.  The druid's leg is still manacled, and another bracelet comes to clamp down Dieter's other leg!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The manacle slips just past the druid's leg!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And the last chain breaks.  The other chains are hovering, waiting for the two.  Frume is holding, waiting to throw the door open for the others.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter gets clear of the swarm of manacles, Maouelue gets snagged on one.  It attaches itself to the man's foot, but not tightly.  Enough to make the wizard hop back, realizing he's snagged on something.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another clean slice, and the three are away though the N doorway.  Frume shuts it behind the crew, saying, "That was fun, now, wasn't it?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The troupe is a hallway running N, ending in a T.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peeks around the corner.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the left, a darkened room is ominous. To the right, a gaping chasm is a mere fifteen feet away.  There is a small ledge that runs on it's edge, N and S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group turns back to the 4-way and inspect the phantasmal barrier.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They go to look at the paradoxical door to the north.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three approach the opaque glass-like substance of the orange-lit door.  There is no obvious sign of a knob or way to open it.  (How would the group like to attempt to open the door?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They don't yet attempt to open the door. They head back to the South end of the room and inspect the strange lock.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beautifully made door is solid iron.  Buffed to a fine polish, some of the filigree and hand-formed sections are minute, even for Maouelue's keen eye.  The scene depicts a two humanoids in a garden, surrounded by plentiful bounty.  Many animals set the scene as well, but eyes are drawn, either by some trick of the piece or magic, to a serpent in the center, twining it's way up the female's leg.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's eyes gleam a cold blue light from under his helm, sending a cross of radiance down upon the depiction.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects for a keyhole or mechanism.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a keyhole, off to the right of center.  It seems to be ingratiated into the scene, it is a star on the horizon.  (History or Religion check for more.)  Hinges are on the left side of the door, massive iron buckles.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Mao is left scratching his head, but Dieter gets a ping, back in the recesses of his mind.  He remembers an old tale of a garden, hidden away from the world.  It was said that this garden was where the original elves came into Faerun, but they were deceived by the beings that were already present in the world.  There was something about a star leading them, and a star being the key to their salvation... but he just can't put his finger on the exact phrasing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls out the snake amulet he has been carrying and inspects it more closely.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter keeps digging back, back, and remembers something else.  There were Naga present at that first meeting.  He remembers there was a massive battle, with the elves striving for a foothold on their new land, and the serpents trying to drive them back whence they came.  Maouelue remembers being a young boy and being told about these stories, how his people came from a land across the seas, out of time itself.  It is said that the stars hold the key to returning to that place.  But the way to travel the stars is long forgotten, lost to the ages and usurped by magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is nothing about the amulet that is special or that stands out.  The serpent attached is a standard symbol of the ouroboros, the central icon of the Naga.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks down at the bone key he carries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He thinks of all the bodies to which they've lain waste. He thinks of these accursed tunnels. And poor Culver! He must have met some terrible fate by now. It is all one mystery after another...Oh the torment!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bone gives Dieter no further insight into the mystery.  There is something, though...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something odd about the construction.  And the material...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter holds it up to the group for a closer look.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Daaaah Frooom...caaan yu halp mie wiph thaaiiiis..?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks at Dieter with serious concern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I mean to say, what do you make of the construction of this key?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he tries to hand it to Frume, he drops it to the cavern floor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah, well, ya know...  Seemed like the thing to do."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bone key cracks down its length, but it is still in one piece.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then tells the group to wait here while he check on something. He goes invisible then dashes away before a word can be uttered.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter heads back to where their Muhlen sisters had first spotted them and tries to secure a length of rope to assist in managing the climb.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter has a harder time getting to the place where the beast was.  The minions didnt have anything on them, but the boss might.  As he approaches the entrance, he sees it littered with rubble.  The entrance has collapsed.  (You might need the others help.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gives a big groan as he makes his way back over to the rope.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Haaaay you guyyyyyyyss!!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Come help me over here! Back down the hole!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He waits a few moments for a reply.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You hear Frume making his way to you after a time.  "Whassa matter, Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I think we were hasty in one of the previous chambers. I need to ask your assistance. Come down.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"On it."  He heads to where you are.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When he sees it he sighs heavily.  Then, taking your meaning, he looks down his arm...</p><p>"Ah,  I don't know how much help I'm gonna be here, lad."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue has tagged along and offers to help.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The three haul rocks for a good few hours, finally revealing the wreck of the hallway and room the snake-man-warrior was killed in.  Most everything in here is covered in a think layer of soot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pokes amongst the remains, looking over the warrior's corpse for anything that might have survived the blaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue heads over to the alcove he didn't properly appreciate before. Was there something there?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter sees ashes and soot.  Every coffin, every clay statue, the bones of the monster they faced-off with...  ashes and soot.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue finds another idol, this one bronze.  Same design as the gold one.  There is a crack in the base of this statue, and it's drawer hangs lopsided inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue attempts to use his sword to wedge the drawer open.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a <i>pop</i> it tumbles out of the base, completely off it's track.  Inside is an object wrapped in a piece of parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard gently unwraps the parchment trying not to touch the object yet.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>My dearest daughters, I had hoped you would follow in my footsteps.  Know that this path is dangerous and rife with peril.  However, once you choose it, I promise you it will not be without glorious rewards.  Find the other two statues, learn what I have to give you.  Once this is complete, find the iron door.  Use this key to start your new lives under a new banner.  May the Great Scaled One rise and live forever! -LM</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard pockets the key and mutters...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"So. Close. Now."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group heads back to the rope, but considers the passageways underneath the route above for a moment. It had all happened so fast, first the ceiling, then the boosting and teleporting up. Had they missed something below?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard is fairly confident that, although these caves are probably vast and they would be able to search a very long time and find many interesting things, things pertaining to their current quarry are above, not below.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's at times like these that Dieter is glad he brings a cool head along.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group attempts to ascend the rope.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They assist the one-handed Frume up, then Dieter helps with the metal mage's ascent, then he attempts to clamber up afterward.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Something seems different in this room to you all... (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stench of acid is still strong here but the clothes are in the wrong place.  Maouelue remembers going through them, as does Dieter.  They both agree that someone else has been through them recently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter goes invisible again and moves out toward the front of the group. They start back around to where they stoned the basilisks and inspect the far end of the room.</i> (r20)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hallway before the group is narrow and the torchlight flickers off it menacingly.  The ceiling is ridged like the gullet of a snake.  (Perception check)</p><p></p><p>There are multiple passageways off of the hallway.  The room to the right has discarded and rotten tapestries moldering way on the floor.  Two open rooms are on the left side of the wall.  At the end of the hall, two snake-men statues stand guard over a vestibule area and a hallway that travels NE.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This hallway is trapped, something about those ridges.  Dieter can't say exactly, but those ridges don't look safe.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard looks in and nods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Druid inspects the area for any triggers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They peer into the space on the left before the triggers.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first room on the left has rotted pillows on the floor surrounding three large stone eggs.  Tapestries that might have hung on the walls are in tatters on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes special interest in the eggs, feeling them over with his ungloved hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue taps into the arcane, sensing magic within the eggs.  They are made of rough stone, but carved well without any cracks or pockmarks on the surface.  There does seem to be a thin red, sticky coating on the tops of all three.  Maouelue smells the substance.  Blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is getting a bit weary of fanatical burning at this point, but he’s to tired to bother arguing. He sets a small flame at the base of the eggs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing happens as it's lit on fire.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, nonplussed, leads the group back out the door and around to find another way across the trapped room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Besides jumping over the trapped floor, there is the diagonal hallway to the S.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They take the diagonal hall back into the 4-way room and look to go through the manacle room. They also want to slice all the manacles down if possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group travels down the length of hallway, with Maouelue and Dieter's passive perception, they catch sight of an irregularity in the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They check it out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a mesh covering cleverly disguised as a false floor.  It covers a pit filled with spikes.  Bones litter the floor below.  The pit is five feet across.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oi that’s a bit of a jump!”, the Druid remarks.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Nice one metal man!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is in all honesty a bit appalled by the sheer amount of alloy accompanying his accomplice of late</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume and Dieter hop over, while Maouelue checks the trajectory.  He hops, but not quite far enough.  His metal boots slip on the very edge of the pit, causing him to slip backward...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a deft hand (and an <i>only</i> hand), Frume reaches out to steady the Dragon Mage, ushering him to safety. </p><p></p><p>The group continues around the path, eventually making their way past the manacles and into the hall where they could go out to the crevasse, or to the seemingly unnaturally dark room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They move left away from the crevasse.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room they approach is pure darkness.  No light penetrates it. (Perception at dis for everyone.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone hugs the wall and moves through the darkness.  After a few steps, everyone hears a low snarl.  No one can tell the direction the snarl is coming from.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter snarls back. He’s itching for a fight by now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He touches his ring.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard’s gauntlets glow blue as he slings his shield over his back, drawing his sword with two hands.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes a moment to slip on a fancy ring as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snarl mixes with a squelching sound, the sound of something moving through muck.  </p><p>It stops suddenly, both the snarling and the sloughing.</p><p>No noise can be heard, the darkness feels like it's pressing in.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nothing shows as a secret door, the darkness does not dissipate.  Frume suggests, "Let's keep going, lads.  Follow the wall.  We should be able to get out of this soon."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They push on down the hall taking care to hug the wall and watch their footing. Dieter uses his staff to tap the way ahead.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The three push up through the hallway to see around the corners.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the three move through the darkness, they're able to make out a T hall connecting to their tunnel.  They move down the row, when suddenly...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A black tentacle <i>snaps</i> at Frume at the rear of the group.  He just steps out of the way of the greasy appendage.  Two more come out of the darkness, with a high pitched squeal accompanying it!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frume dodges one, <i>three</i> more extend from the darkness, attach themselves to each of the adventurers, and start slowly pulling them back to the blank void!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>DA1 was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (11) + 1 = <code>12</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shite, shite, shite!  Not again!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Target darkmantle not found.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tentacle dragging Frume back is sliced through, he rolls off to the side to try and cut at one of the other's..</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His sword slices through Dieters, they both roll away.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Reeling from two of it's appendages being sliced off, it cannot successfully bring Maouelue any closer.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last tentacle is sliced through and Maouelue is freed, Frume starts running to the end of the hall.  "Let's leave this monster, lads.  We stung it well, it shan't follow us now."  </p><p>(Quick point of order, any range attacks at the thing would be at disadvantage because it's in darkness.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Tentacles flip around the druid, but he side-steps them easily.  Suddenly, a <i>large</i> tentacle emerges from the middle of the mire.  It wraps itself around the armored mage and starts sliding it, again, towards the darkness.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a frenzied slash with his sword in one hand, hoping to his some part of the beast. he strikes it hard in the torso. His blade seems to dissipate followed by his body. He materializes next to Frume!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The druid swings wildly, hitting nothing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume peeks from around the corner...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Hanging his head, he runs and stabs at the huge tentacle still wrapped around the mage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a shriek, the tentacle releases Maouelue.  Partially severed, it flops erratically as it is reeled back into the darkness.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[200 xp]</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group moves ahead and around to the left.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This hall is familiar, although it was seen from the opposite side before.  Just as Frume is about to step on the raised floor tiles, Dieter pulls him back.</p><p>"Thank ye, lad.  Too busy looking at that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume uses his stump to point at an intricately carved double doorway, oak with iron bandings for the hinges.  Although not quite as elaborate as the garden scene from the metal door, this is just as well made.  The scene on it depicts a ritual taking place, a naked woman is on an altar, all variety of beasts cavort in the background.  Raising a blade in the air, the priest performing the ritual looks odd.  As you all come closer, you can see his face has been seared off, the wood scorched.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter give the door a cursory yank.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It opens slightly, you hear falling metal coming from the other side.  The door is able to be opened, just catching on something now.  Beyond the small opening, the room is dark.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves over to take a look, checking for traps and seeing whether he can perceive anything in the room with his darkvision.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can see torchlight flickering off some metal inside, looks like gold from here.  It's near the floor just inside, but the crack in the door isn't too big yet.  As Maouelue pulls back, he checks the picture on the door again.  (With that perception check...) Mao notices it's odd.  Something is odd about the scene.  (Investigation check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A sudden rush comes to the wizard as he's looking at the scene play out on the wooden door facades.  Immediately, there is a great sense of danger about what the ritual represents.  He's also very sure that this isn't depicting a ritual in the traditional sense.   It's more like the priest is defending himself from the woman.  As he looks closer, Maouelue notices horns on the woman's head...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They all work together to clear and open the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doors swing wide, bringing with them a bevy of golden items.  Kettles, pots, dishware and silverware all clatter to the floor.  It is as if all of these items were piled up and shut inside hastily.  In the torchlight, a golden dais can be seen emerging from the mound.  Many more golden items are piled high on it, the dimensions are large and it basically seems like a pile of golden treasure in this room.  The dais is approximately 5ft by 10ft, placed directly in the middle of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The druid riffles through the pile, seeking anything gold resembling an acorn. But no matter if not...he could always melt it...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes more of a loremaster's approach and begins inspecting the items for additional symbols and examining the dais.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are many pieces here to melt down if you wanted, a few pieces of tableware that could be sufficient are around, too.  (d12 for how many you find.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees the same thematic structure of the door on the walls of the room.  Mainly animals cavorting, then growing larger.  As the scene progresses from the front of the room to the back of the room, the animals seem to grow in sentience, walk on their hind legs.  They start slaughtering the lesser animals, until finally, on the back wall, a gilded form of a demon, two heads of simian make, with tentacles for arms, screams at the sky.  Beside him, a massive serpent is coiled around a tree that stretches from floor to ceiling, the top boughs even melding into the top stonework of the room.  To the right of the serpent, a skeleton with its musculature still attached, has the head of a dragon, the body of a humanoid, the legs of a lion, and the feet of a giant eagle.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue makes his way into the room, he bumps and shifts through the various pieces when, in an instant, the pile shifts...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A rolling pile of golden debris falls around the room.  Revealing a woman manacled to the dais.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume stares at the woman.</p><p>"She's not breathin', lads.  But she doesn't look rotten, like everything else in the gods-forsaken caverns."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He starts to approach the dais.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blue-silver light glows around the woman and the mage.  (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The glow dissipates around the two, and the wizard leans down to the dais.  The woman is not breathing, not moving.  She looks perfectly healthy, otherwise.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage pulls out a potion of healing and begins tipping it down the lady’s throat.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue's gauntleted hands touch the woman.  He tips her head back and pours the red healing liquid in her mouth.  The liquid spills out, runs onto the dais.  She feels completely limp, as if she doesn't have any muscles at all in her slim frame.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue raises his blade with both hands, the tip of the blade pointed downwards. He thrusts hard into the woman’s chest!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Violent ripping and tearing of sinew and bone can be heard as the Dragon Mage's blade pierces the woman.  No blood spills, none is expelled from the wound.  The woman is still completely limp, like a doll of flesh.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pale skin is reflected eerily in the pale blade.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shoves him aside and sniffs at the lady, his snout turning a bit long and whiskered...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume steps further into the room, saying "Whoa, Dieter, what's going on?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Baeeestttsss! Grreaaaauuuuuueeeoooogggh!!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leads them back over to the door with the star key.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a wistful look back, Frume follows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group is clearly beginning to suffer from their long stint underground. Maouelue is losing the thread of his righteous vigor. Dieter is aping out unwittingly. The metal mage rushes over to the door and instead the star key, twisting hard.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door swings effortlessly open.  Torchlight sputtes momentarily, but resolves on a mountain of platinum bars, all stamped with a seal of a foundry from Waterdeep.  All tallied, there are 100 bars of platinum, totalling 5,000 lbs.  A pound of platinum yields 10 coins.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A gleam pierces the armor clad mage’s eye...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume is slack-jawed at the sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They begin hoarding.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Spitefully the druid pitches in. This dread chain they have forged...the relentless pull of fate...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As they finish up, they move to the other end of the room and look at the translucent door again.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The orange moves as a fire would've seemingly casting shadows on the other side.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sends a bolt of fire at the orange phantasm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame goes through the door and the barrier evaporates.  The heat hits the three hard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group looks into a room with an enormous vat of what appears to be lava as the centerpiece.  There is a scalloped edge with the lava pooling ten feet below the floor of the rest of the room.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume looks worried, but stands by the door, weapon ready.  He shrugs. "Can't close it, but I'm here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue begins stacking platinum bars outside the pit...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Apeiter shrugs and turns back into a man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out the gold he has just looted as well and stacks it, taking the mage's lead. They both had business here it would seem.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue begins searching around for large pieces of rock that he can begin to pile up.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter begins looking for scraps of wood.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both look at the giant banded door, then back at each other, then back at the door, then back at each other, then move to the giant door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to dismantle the door at the hinges.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They alternate at freezing and heating the hinges in quick succession. They weave back and forth between them, mimicking each other in reverse. Much like they had when tracing the circle of runes in their trance way back at the house of Ilmater. Something in the chaos of these moments has led the two back to their weird synchronicity. There they continued to work. One in gold and wood, the other in platinum and zeal. On and on they worked at the metal until....</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume tries to lend the other two a hand (the only one he has), but they're in lock-step.  Frume keeps watch for any signs of intruders instead.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They two work together to dismantle the door and attempt to build it into some work surfaces. In one end of the lava room, they set up a long thin box and reinforce it with iron.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The one they call Deleter digs inside his pack for some long forgotten tools. He thinks to himself, just how handy inter-dimensional storage really is when it's all said and done.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Now they search about for a cornerstone. Something large and flat. Something that can take a beating...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They think back to moments ago...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The woman...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Yes...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's perfect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They bid Frumious to stand guard over their construction. He wouldn't be on any help anyway, not really for what they were up to.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frume nods, curious.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They walk back around to the manacled woman and inspect the dais.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They look at its base and the construction thereof.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What appears to be solid gold, or maybe gilded in it.  The woman is still motionless on the table.  A wound still in her chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They try to lift the platform off its base.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is solidly secured to the floor.  (Less a table, more an altar.  Solid rectangular piece of metal or gilded stone.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers their travels a moment, then begins tapping on the walls, searching for any sign of weakness or echo on the other side.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is being very careful to stay back from the woman.  Maouelue searches the area, moving his hands over the bas reliefs on the walls.  He lingers a few extra moments on the triad as the centerpiece of the pictures.  The room seems a shrine of sorts.  Or perhaps, something more?  He finds no secret spaces, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue moves out of the room and back north to look west across the tile room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A silver Ouroboros is in the center of this room.  With his darkvision, Maouelue can also see scratch marks on the area of the base where the drawer would be.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>i’m looking back across the raised/pressure plates</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The figure in the adjacent room catches his eye and he inspects it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is exactly like the bronze and gold ones you've previously seen.  You can assume it has the same drawer in the onyx base.  Where as the bronze had a key, this one does not.  Words are inscribed on the base this time.  <i>I am The Great World Serpent. I begin where I end and end where I begin.  Name me.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The drawer starts to open, then gets stuck on something.  (Strength check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The drawer comes out a little more.  Maouelue can see inside.  A piece of parchment lays at the bottom, and colored jewels sparkle atop it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He is compelled beyond restraint and attempts to secure them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It opens further.  If you're careful you could probably get the contents out.  (Sleight of hand check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The gauntlet is preventing Maouelue's hand from getting in.  A finger brushes against one of the jewels.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Gah...Dieter!!! come over here!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The druid hears the yell and follows</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He scoffs a little at the gauntlets.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is able to remove the two items from the drawer.  A jeweled encrusted dagger with a curved blade is the first item.  When unsheathed, it is dull black.  It almost looks wet.  The page is written in a serpentine language.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The dagger is coated in the blood of a higher demon from the Nine Hells.  It cannot be wiped off, nor can the dagger be destroyed unless it is consumed in the fires of the Nine Hells.  If this blade kills anything with a soul, that soul is bound to the blade.  Each soul collected gives it the ability to kill an entity of a higher plane, god or demon alike.  This would also relate to the sarrukh, who were the original serpentine race, the progenitors of all serpentine peoples.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He stows his shortsword...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dagger</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Damsel</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter dashes to the dais.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Draws the dagger!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“My friend!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“My friend!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I’ve got a dagger!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter drives the dagger downward into the diaphragm of the downed damsel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue marches mesmerized</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>His armor a mirror of the wild, frenzied scene.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The knife pierces the woman.  Again a wound, a tearing of flesh.  Yet the woman does not stir....</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Until...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter plunges the knife down, his hand grazes the woman's skin.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her eyes open and she looks down at the two wounds in her chest.  Blood starts pooling at the man's hands.  Black blood oozes from the cut Maouelue made, while there is a sizzling sound of frying coming from the site of the black dagger.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"M...  Master?"  She calls to Dieter.  "Why?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She is pale, a ghostly white.  You'd never noticed it before, but you suppose she's looked like that from the beginning.  The color of bleached bone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her hands reach out to caress Dieter's face, lovingly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Destiny.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles.  "I could be."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A primal rumble emanates from the Druid’s chest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He locks eyes with her.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He reaches out to her face.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He twists the dagger a bit and tilts his gaze curiously looking, if possible, deeper into her eyes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks into the eyes of the woman.  Blood stains her thin shift.  Her smile beckons him.  Just before their lips meet, Dieter pulls away, pulling the dagger from the woman's body.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She shifts her legs off of the dais.  "Is something wrong, Master?"  She frowns at you.  Coquettishly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Show me your mind.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head, questioningly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“When you read this, what do you see?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He holds up the parchment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head the other way, looks into Dieter's eyes.  "What do you want me to see, Master?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s eyes flash’s t the mage, they are black and red.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage’s eye glances quickly at the dagger, then back to the lady.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reels a moment, then looks down at his hand. He is suddenly sickened, and pulls the dagger out, staring dumbstruck at the blade.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman looks at the Dragon Mage, peers at him as if noticing him for the first time.  Doe eyes bat at the man, then back to Dieter.  "I'm alive.  Thanks to Master."  She gets up.  She's rail thin, her hair is waist length and jet black.  It somehow conflicts heavily with her extremely pale skin.  Aside from the dread you both feel, you can't help but think she's one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Looking intently at Dieter, she says, "Whatever Master wants, I will do."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks down, then at Dieter.  Her laugh is a girl's laugh, innocent.  "I can't lift that, Master.  It's too heavy for me.  Also, it is attached to the floor."  She approaches Dieter, slowly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Except what I want.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I can only do what I can do.  I can do many other things..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Show me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She approaches closer to Dieter, smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She reaches out to kiss Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stops.  Looks at Dieter, pouting petulantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You're no fun."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is caught between torment rage seduction and longing. His eyes flash color after color.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She whips her head to the mage.  "You can certainly try.  Wouldn't it be much more fun to just...  give in?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She raises her eyes, feigning being impressed.  "Lord of dragons, eh?  I've met many lords.  Not one could ever stave off my...  personality for very long."  She smiles coyly at you.  "It seems we are at a crossroads, gentlemen.  How should we proceed?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Stave off...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Stave off!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes the end of the staff of baobab and thrusts it into the open wounds in her chest!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The staff goes completely through the woman.  She looks down at it, nonplussed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Master is mad," she pouts.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He stares, amazed, for a moment then pulls the staff back out. He turns to the entry way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He goes to the left and stands at the edge of the plates.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, Master."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Walk across this room.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She cocks her head at Dieter.  Then smiles widely at him.  "As you wish."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She steps lightly on the trapped floor.  Midway over the tiles, she turns to look back at Dieter.  "Care to join me, Master?"  She walks backward to the across the rest of the tiles, staring at Dieter the entire way.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Follow me...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He leads her back East and around to their construction near the lava.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue follows at a distance watching the scene unfold.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She follows you, tiptoeing across the tiles again.  The three of you approach the lava room.  Dieter immediately senses something is off.  Frume is not at his post.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note, but does not falter. He leads her around to the left of the lava and to the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Go in here.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Master wants me to go... into the pit?"  She smiles.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. Take this. Dig me a staircase from the pit up to the right.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands her a shovel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Meanwhile Maouelue does take note of Frume’s absence and begins lightly scanning for clues.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman takes the shovel, in both hands.  She walks past the Dieter to the edge of the pit.  Approaching it backwards, staring at Dieter, she stops at the very edge facing away from it.  She cocks her head again, looking deeply into Dieter's eyes.  "We could have had so much fun."  She falls backwards into the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks the lava room, no signs of struggle.  He checks the garden vault.  Some bars of platinum are missing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He chuckles to himself.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Poor soul. He deserves whatever he made off with. This mission took more than he could afford.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He whispers a few words of prayer.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Someday...maybe you will let us make good on our promise...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He turns back to rejoin Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter looks into the pit he sees...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His shovel laying on the ground, amidst bones and other detritus.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmph...it figures.”</p><p><i>He goes back over to the lava room and stares down in the pit for a few moments. Then pulls out his bedroll and finds a spot with a suitable temperature inside the room, then lays down shuddering.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees this strange passage of behavior and stands vigil over his resting friend.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he walks away, Dieter hears coquettish laughing in his head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p><i>A snake slithers around the hub, weaving in and out of the spokes, flicking a red tongue as it does, piercing the colors of the vignette.

<div class="character-1"><p>(So it's less Quantum Leap and more Eastern religion/previous life, where he knows all that's happened on the 'other side'.  He's not burdened with jumping back and forth, but he does have memories of being the other entity."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two, keeping especially close watch, as safe for the time being.  As the walls seem to close in around them, they wake up feeling rested, at least.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, surprised at this bit of impetuousness, breaks his brooding and slowly a determined look comes over his face. He moves over to the pit and looks down to where the armored man has jumped.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue jumps into the pit, putting his faith to the test.  Yet even the power of Bahamut, in all of his glory, can't stop the spikes from battering him around as he hits the ground hard.

(Take 4 points of bludgeoning damage.)</p><p></p><p>When he comes to himself and looks around, he sees four solid walls, a bunch of bones and debris, and Dieter's shovel lying on the floor of the spike pit.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter grabs it and begins shoveling dirt from the edge and tossing it down, covering up the spikes. Maouelue works in turn trying to cover up the spikes and chip away at the NE wall, building up again from there.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter takes a point of exhaustion, working so hard.  (Maouelue is getting beefy ever since he upgraded a cleric level!)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>During their long toiling work building the staircase, the two adventurers combed the caverns quite a bit. One day they went over to inspect the giant rift they had been avoiding. It was time to take a closer look...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After the toiling work of the forge, the two men decide to take a break and discover the mysterious chasm.  As they travel through the hallway,  the rift blooms into view.  Darkness swells both above and below.  A small sliver of light can be seen far above them, below is complete blackness.  There is a small walkway that meanders both north and south, clinging precariously to what now looks like the edge of a massive stone edifice.  Bats flit about, not threatening the group.  There are some other flying animals mixed in with them, slightly larger, but nothing is posing a threat at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the chasm a moment, then begins to concentrate. Dieter can an ethereal form beginning to coalesce up in the swarm of bats. After a few moments, he understands and looks to back to the mage, now fully in the midst of his ritual. He keeps an eye out for the time being while the familiar descends and binds to Maouleue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>After an hour of this, the wizard comes to and blinks twice at the bat which then immediately zooms upward toward the light above piercing the dark.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He attends a report, telepathic or otherwise about how high it is and what lies above. Should there be any means escalating this slope, the wizard would ask to know of it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat flies... flies... flies...  At the edge of it's telepathic link, it relays to the wizard all it can see. The opening is getting closer, looks to be a scar-shaped gash in the world.  At best guess, before the bond breaks, it's maybe 200ft above the two.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue instructs the bat to fly up to the surface then come back down and report.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As it comes back into range it receives the signal and follows out the commands.  Several minutes pass as the other animals seem riled by something, they flutter upwards rapidly and perch, suspended from the ceiling, tens of feet above.  A small rumble can be heard, very faintly, to the N, and from below.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue's new bat familiar returns and reports.  The cavern is extremely vast, the opening is 180ft above.  It is an entrance gouged into what seems to Maouelue as a barrow of sorts.  Ruined stone walls surround an altar or pedestal.  The room appeared to be unused for quite some time as the bat reports detritus all over.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note of the rumble and takes a cursory peek at the source of the sound.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat does not see any safe way down.  There are ledges and areas cut away from and into the rocks, naturally as far as it can tell, where the two would be able to stand and walk safely.  Getting to those spots could be treacherous.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is.  Sounds big, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two start heading back toward the forge.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue understands the bat's disdain, but...that's what familiars are for to an extent...He'd give it a spectral spider as a snack a bit later...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tugs at Maouelue's arm as they walk back toward the forge.</i></p><p>"I've got a plan...It's crazy...but it's a plan...."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the two return to their construction, Dieter tells Maouelue about his plan and what they might want to prepare for the way. The wizard shakes his head and lets out a chortle of impressed, and a bit flabbergasted, approval.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>...dear how long had it been...? The time seemed endless in these halls with only the light from the forge and what they provided giving note. Thus the two would venture over to and from the crevasse to note the timing of the light from above, the better to track their days with.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Somehow they had come through it all unscathed, mostly, and the manual labor and reminiscence was working wonders for their camaraderie. Maouelue spent more time out of his shell lately as it was just too unwieldy and hot to wear heavy plate at the forge. Dieter was still making peace with his fraught relationship with metal. He supposed that since the lava's heat was of the earth rather than of burning woods, he was more willing to indulge.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And indulge he did. They did. They hammered away at that gold and platinum attempting all manner of tricks. Maouelue told stories about ancient folded-metal blades he had read about in the archives, while Dieter regaled the elf about water shapeshifters he knew who could cleave a shield with a thin-but-powerful stream of water. It was great to slow down and spend some time together.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>He watched the glow and heat flicker and bend in the platinum as it slowly became red, then yellow, then white, then liquified slowly at first, then all at once falling down into the semi-spherical molds. Next he started pulling them up to let them cool and settle a bit before he would finally flip the mold together and send it down one more time to remove the seam. After a few minutes, he pulls up the rig again and brings it over to the cooling pit, which they had built into the dirt covering the spike pit. His hands glow blue as he sends a ray of frost over the mold to crash the temperature. Steam spews everywhere as he does so. After a while he stops the ray and watches as the vapor begins to dissipate. With a cautious hand he reaches out to touch the mold. He opens up the box and sees three beautiful, pure new orbs, now made of the metal of his master, ready to be put into the line of vengeance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>He would have to become it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And so he did.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>After several hours, he had managed to make quite a few gold shuriken that he set about applying poison to. As he counted his work, he glanced over at Maouelue, who all the while had been repeating his orb processing, and now sat surrounded by nine shining platinum balls. What a sight. What a confirmation of his belief. We are the light drake, we are the dark snake.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>Over in the corner of the 4-way, Dieter picked up stray shuriken and stowed them in his bandolier. All of a sudden, he began tidying things up and shutting down the workshop area. Maouelue's concentration was broken by this and he started.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>That one caught the mage off guard and they each had a mighty chortle. Their bags were nearly set, the workings shut down. It was time now to be on their way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Oh dear...what—?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And with that, he leads Maouelue out toward the crevasse without a backward glance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>And with that he begins singing and weaving his arms, pointing his hands at the soil in and around their side of the crevasse upward, rising.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Then he sinks the Staff of Baobab right down in the soil at his feet, sticking out at an angle into the rising abyss of the crevasse's center. A giant Baobab tree begins to ascend up and outward, climbing into the upper reaches of the cavern, a thin route cut out of the enchanted thicket surrounding the tree's trunk.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The mage...for once...is speechless.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter taps into a deep pool of druidic knowledge.  Warm humming stems from him and echoes around the cavern, casting harmonics everywhere.  A crescendo of sound, positive radiant energy is visible as golden and green sparkle motes in the air.  The bats take flight moments before Dieter thrusts the Baobab staff into the ground.  </p><p></p><p>At first, nothing happens.  Then, the gold and green motes seem to be sucked into the staff, giving it a glow that nearly blinds the two heroes.  Dieter yells to his friend to stand back just as roots erupt from the bottom of the staff, growing directly into the soil of the cavern wall.  Thick shoots start emanating from the staffs top, and the width of the staff starts to grow.  Second by second the staff adds more boughs.  The staff turns into a massive tree growing from the side of the cavern wall.  Vines have knotted themselves up the side of the tree to make a makeshift walkway/ladder the men can use to climb up.  With a final <i>creak</i>, the tree finishes its growth, a tuft of leaves blotting out the sunlight at the top of the rift.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There are more people coming and going from the room, and suspiciously the same one comes back three or four times, each time checking the altar in the middle of the room.  An hour passes with none entering.  Then two.  Finally, the suspicious man, who looks very rat-like, enters the room and ushers two others in carrying a heavy burlap sack each.  They heft them onto the altar with a sickly <i>thud</i>.  The rattish man sneers at the sacks and rubs his hands together.  Realizing the others were still in the room, he shoos them out hurriedly, and waves his hand over the doorway.  A light blue shimmer covers the doorway.  The man stops, seems pleased, does the same for the windows next.  After the room is sufficiently secured for the man, he goes back to the sacks and starts taking items out.  (Perception check for Mao, please.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pieces he sloughs out of the bag are what remains of the woman Mao had killed to the south of the barrow.  The man arranges the pieces neatly, to make a sort of makeshift person.  When complete, he looks over both shoulders and out of both windows again.  Coming back to the body, he spreads both hands wide over them.   Dark smoke curls around the man's fingers, then hands, then arms, extending down and around the pieces of the dead woman as well.  Maouelue can see the whites of his eyes, or at least his eyes have a completely white cast to them.  He's muttering now.  (Religion check for the speech, Arcana for the spell.)  The bits of pieces on the table start to shudder.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is having a hard time concentrating as the words are causing a thrumming in his chest.  A dull ache starts as the words continue to wash over him.  The dark shadow smoke washes out from the man now in waves; pours over the dais and completely obscures the contents upon the altar.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the man stops chanting.  He stands there with his mouth open, eyes white, buffeted in smoke tinged purple in places.  Arc lightning races through the smoke.  Then the darkness descends.  Maouelue is completely blind to the happenings.  He puts a hand directly in front of his face and, thank the gods, he can barely make out the silhouette.  More magic, this is.  </p><p></p><p>The heavy darkness and smoke slough off like ash falling to the ground.  The man is standing before the altar, facing an abomination sitting, staring at him.  The thing has a rat face, but somewhat humanoid as well.  It has rat like appendages, a tail, but also have very human features, too.  It is a perfect blending of the two species.  The rattish man chuckles.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter leads on hurriedly, Quency follows at a medium pace. The Druid comes around the corner to find Stenchy and Frenchy roasting a stray bit of fungus over a coal from the forge. They both are leaned in, wafting the fungal fumes into their eager faces. A few half drunk bottles of ale surround the scene.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks about, slightly bewildered. The two besmirled faces turn up toward him and waft a large tuft of smoke over into his face. Quenchy steps up behind him.</i></p><p></p><p>“So let’s ‘ave a look at zis mirror, non?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks askance at Quenchy then turns back to another mouthful of mushroom mist. This pattern seems to oddly repeat a few times, then he turns to take one more mouthful and meets his tail between his eyes, he lunges out to bite at it, but glottal laughter becomes elongated hisses as his ‘friends?’ forms stretch upward laughissing all the way up. The six yellow eyes glisten, then blink as a silver shimmer pulls into view. Shrinking back down slightly, and looking mildly less snakelike, the henchmen hold the mirror up to Dieter’s face and force him to stare into it right as the hallucination begins to fully come up.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mirrors surface shows Dieter, eyes wide and unfocused, yet his clarity has never been higher.  The surface of the mirror is crystal clear.  Yet, now, it starts to haze over with a sort of frosted rim, the ice crystals crackling and creeping to meet in the center.  The center focal point becomes a tunnel, the frost becomes walls akin to the ones Dieter remembers travelling in to get to this accursed underground tomb.  And with that thought, the speed of the tunnel picks up until it feels to Dieter like he is being catapulted though a cone of ice, the end getting farther and farther away.  At the point where he feels he can't go any faster, the end of the tunnel can be seen, a distant black dot on the horizon.  The speed intensifies and the dot grows to completely fill his vision...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He blinks once.  Twice.  Then he notices the stars.  He looks left and purple nebulae waft in the distance.  Enormous floating land masses dot the amorphous landscape.  Their massive bulks house stone buildings, some have trees, others have architecture Dieter has never seen nor could fathom.  In the far distance, it looks like a magic battle is raging, streaks of red, blue, and silver swirl and explode.  A gigantic leviathan swims towards the battle, silently.  Dieter's mind reels as he watches everything pass him by.  And then he realizes...  he's moving in this incredible sea...  Towards...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A small island appears close to the druid.  It's covered in lush grass and a single tree, its branches thick and full of fresh, green leaves.  He alights on it gracefully and spies a pool of water underneath the tree.  The liquid, however, is made of a silvery substance, which reflects the myriad colored lights of this place oddly.  Just as Dieter is about to reach out and touch the pool, a thought comes into his head.  It's the though of a person, featureless but bulky.  Muscled but ordinary, non-descript.  A generic henchman, Dieter thinks.  As he thinks this, the image morphs into existence right in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks over the generic person, thinking, <i>"This looks an awful lot like Frenchy."</i>.  As soon as the though ends, a silvery string of liquid comes from the pool and starts to cover the entity.  The substance starts at the feet, covers the entire body, then retreats the same way it came.  As it retreats, Dieter can now see the features of Frenchy clear on this man.  Frenchy looks around, smiles at Dieter, then sits by the tree, waiting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pool bubbles slightly and the silver string comes out again, this time creating a being purely from it's essence.  This one looks of Stenchy.  A third time this silver stream comes out, a third man - Quenchy.  The three look at each other, then look to Dieter, beaming.  (What would you like to do?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Where do you go when you go where do you go?”</p><p>“Three I see yet four there may be. I wonder where the last of thee could be since only three i see.”</p><p>“Where does she go when she goes where does she go?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>His form breaks into fractured shifts of shape, sounds pouring out at odd angles. He settles on a nine-headed serpent that begins to reach out to every face  and the spaces on either side as well.

<div class="character-1"><p>The image shifts, flips upside down and it becomes a dungeon.

<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p><i>Naked, Dieter lies shivering in the detritus. Maouelue picks him up and carries him over to the forge to warm up. He brings the mage over and lays him out on the anvil altar.</i></p><p></p><p>“Time to wake up.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He reaches down into Dieter’s pack which he has brought near. His hand roots around for a moment.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Tell me, why should I let live one who raises the dead for his own sick purposes?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He starts pouting, "Was only doing my job.  Putting my own spin on it, but only a job just the same.  I can lead you to the lycanthropes.  If you sway them, they will turn.  They're only working with the Runemark because he promised them an uprising.  If you give them something else they want, they'd turn to you, surely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Your own spin! That’s rich...that woman was in pieces before...before you. That was more than lycanthropy friend.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A mage, learned in the necromantic arts, I don't deny it.  Cast out from society and every place of learning I've ever attended, though.  All I ever wanted was to make my mark on the world.  We're very close, to tell the truth."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We?...Close?”</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, yes.  What do you want to know?  The Runemark," he shudders, "is a nasty man who has taken steps to take over Oakhurst.

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pulls his blade back, mutters a word of cleansing, then thrusts it clear through the Black Knight's gorget, crimson blood spilling over the blackened, burnished plate armor and into the pleats of his greaves.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The knight coughs up blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is all adrenaline and zeal. He surveys the mass carnage surrounding him and suppresses a spiritual retch. He is nearly at a loss for what to try and make sense of first, when his mind turns sharply to Dieter. He spins around and tries to perceive the fleeing monstrosity.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue remember them going north, but nothing from that.  He can't see them at this time.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue quickly pours a potion down Frenchy's throat and brings him to consciousness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you both move to look over the remains...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight's body twitches.  Suddenly, he pulls his legs in, pushes slowly off the ground, and gets to his feet.  A blue light is emanating from a locket around his neck.  "You're going to have to do better than that, wizard."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight takes off his helm and throws it off to the side.  Maouelue sees another familiar face, although he has only seen it briefly.  The last he saw it, the man was unconscious and being hauled down a hole in the middle of Oakhurst.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad Dunnol, which you now know as Bazad Muhlen, stares down Maouelue, breathing heavily and tightening his grips on his swords.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It wasn't supposed to be like this!" he yells at the mage.  "You were supposed to join us!  You were supposed to help!  Instead you ruined everything."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well then, your sister trying to assassinate my friend was a bad start...Tell me, oh most pitiful of the Muhlens, what foul atrocities have you committed at the behest of your power hungry sisters? Why was there no mention of you in your Father’s vault? Just....<i>Dearest Daughters...</i>? Surely, you can see how they use you to meet their ends....Why not be an individual rather than a joined of doomed causes?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pitiful?" Maouelue can see the tears in his eyes, the trails on his face now.  "Maybe I am at that.  My father recognized only his daughters as heirs to his kingdom of knowledge.  For some reason, only they were invited to his inner circle.  It bothers me not, for they shared with me the fruits of their labors.  They let me know the dark heart of our dear, dead father.  And I would not wish my direst enemy to be aware of his inner thoughts.  To be welcomed by him was to be used by him.  His knowledge, though...  that's a different story.  You were the ones who had the key, he said you unlocked it.  You can bring about the end of all this.  If my sisters attacked you...  either you provoked them to do so.  Or the madness...  the madness has taken them completely."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. They have been taken... And what of this madness? Will you not stand and break the cycle?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I have my orders.  I'm to bring you to the Runemark.  He knows you have the pieces to unlock father's mystery.  Culver said you went to the mines.  You can find the lost city.  You can bring them back.  You can bring them <i>all</i> back!  But he said your hearts are hard, and you would fight.  We were to bring you in any way possible."  He spins the blades.  "And I intend to."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"GAH!" he gasps!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue grimaces deeply under his visor. Mimicking his double, his opposite, his shadow...he throws the Frostbitten Helm to the ground. His hands glow blue, his eyes prismatic as a blinding radiance seems to form around, shimmering in the bright plate, bow smattered with the blood and detritus of beast man and otherwise. A ray of frozen light shoots out of his hands and flies toward the lesser Muhlen!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Frenchy sees the wizard’s zealous strike lay the Black Knight low again, a light flickers in his eye. He runs to his fallen fighter friend and picks up the Mace of Reduction...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Its pure hilarity...it’s almost as if they’ve never wielded a mace before.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the mace comes down, over and over again, bits of ice flake and spray off, some superficially cutting into the mage and his hench-friend.  The toil does help loosen the armor and un-ice the rest of what's on the body.  (Investigation checks for the black knight, the 'veteran' and the others at large.  Oh, and if there's anything else you wanted to pick over, feel free!)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>“Here, drink this...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He goes to grab a potion then sees his bag is empty of them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Shit!”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The black knight has plate armor, painted black with an insignia just poking out from behind a scratch the damage left in it.  He carried a great-sword, a heavy crossbow, and a dagger, all standard.  The necklace on around his neck held a blue crystal, but it is now cracked down the center and has completely lost it's luster.  Lastly, he carries the same parchment the others had on them, a few in fact, concerning the wayward druid and mage from Oakhust.</p><p>(Arcana check for the necklace, history check for the partial insignia.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't quite tell what either is.  He's a bit tired at the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The veteran has splint armor that is actually very well maintained.  Standard armor, no +.  He also carried a long sword, a couple short swords, and a couple daggers, again standard.  He had two greater potions of healing and one standard potion of healing.  He also had a hand drawn map of both the barrow site, and a scrawled map of another area, this one unfamiliar to the both of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deep in an inside pocket of his coat, you find two interesting items.  The first is a ring with a marvelous ruby inset.  But then you look, and it's a bright amber color.  When you look closer, swirls of yellow and flecks of black can be seen in tumult within the gem.  It looks like lava made into a gem.  (Arcana for identification, or short/long rest to attune.)  The other is a small carved mink, made from what seems to be a pliable bone-like material.  The minks eyes are very lifelike and sparkle in the dawn's light, which is just coming up over the horizon.  (Perception for your surroundings now that it's lighter outside.  Investigation on the scrimshaw mink for info on that.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you both pick through the rest of the thugs, you find serviceable maces, all in various states of disrepair.  A few light and heavy crossbows and a bevy of bolts.  All in all, including the knight and the vet, you found 250 gold, 700 silver.  (Anything else you were looking for specifically?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue looks around to see smoke from doused fires rising to the sky.  The din sounds like a camp breaking down and moving.  To the S, a stream runs SE, and there looks to me a small bridge to cross farther downstream.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Frenchy go through the rest of the remains grabbing what they could find. They pick up the net and some of the stray platinum balls from Maouelue's triple triumvirate. They also take a moment to pick up Dieter's spare shuriken that he hadn't had time to take.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy nods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They make for the river crossing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It takes a bit of scouring but (with a great perception roll) Maouelue is able to spot a higher outcropping.  Unfortunately, two things might be wrong with it.  Firstly, it's across a rickety bridge.  Second, there looks to be something on the ridge already.  Other than that, there are a variety of trees around.  Not a forest, per se, but with Frenchy there, Maouelue would feel relatively safe to get his reverie in.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue comes out of his trance, he scans around for Frenchy and the general state of affairs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy is still there, on the lookout.  He's looking a bit hazy around the edges, though.  He says, "Faites attention. Il y a quelqu'un à la tente."  And he starts to fade more.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue looks around for the approaching person as his fading friend recommends.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first thing you notice that he's very nimble.  He wears brown and dark green cloaks and leather, blending into the surrounding greenery.  As he gets closer Maouelue sees his lined and weary face, the face of a man that has either had too many quests or been on a very long mission for a very long time.  He strides up confidently, loosening his pack and sitting down cross-legged in front of the wizard.</p><p></p><p>"Good morn and well met, stranger.  It seems you might be in need of assistance.  Your friend has just...  vanished."  He doesn't seem particularly taken aback by this.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"He...does that. They call me...Lumao...and you are?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Most just call me ranger.  Names Daran, though.  You in trouble, son?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Heh...I suppose you could say that..."</p><p></p><p>"What gave me away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You look a bit worse for the wear, to be honest.  Running from or to yer trouble, then?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Would it mean anything to you if I told you I don't much know the difference anymore?"</p><p></p><p><i>He loosens a strap on his armor and takes his helmet off for the moment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man lets out a very subdued, but somehow very grandfatherly, paternal laugh.  "Aye, aye."  He looks around the area eagle-eyed, taking everything in.  "If you need anything to eat, I'm about to restart my cookfire.  Just over the rise there."  He gets up and nods to you.  Then heads back across the river.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You can see as he crosses the basically broken bridge that you'll have to be nimble or careful to get across. The stream doesn't seem deep or dangerous, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmph...Seems friendly enough... Got to keep your wits about you now though <i>Lumao</i>..."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>He must go to him. He must. And perhaps he must trust in this man as well. Ranger...Daran...sure, why not?</i></p><p></p><p>"Come on lady of fate...let's dance again."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He packs his things, hanging the mace from his belt, just in case...then heads off over the river. He pulls a quarterstaff from his bag to steady himself across the river. He would have to remember to thank the proprietors at Bags of Holding Inc. they sure did make good products.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue hops across the bridge pretty deftly.  Some areas creak, but nothing falls off.  Thinking on the ranger, you get a good feeling about him.  Seemed honest and soft spoken.  The scars are definitely badges of honor from battle.  He didn't seem shy about anything.  You can probably ask him more about them without offending him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hullo there! Turns out it does get a bit cold sitting out overnight in this stuff..." <i>He tugs at his plate collar.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Offer still good to take a warm up here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pull up a stump."  He has started the kindling on fire and is starting to put larger sticks on.  His pack is open and there are utensils out, a few packages of things, and there are two small rabbits trimmed and ready to be cooked.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thanks.... Do you come from these parts Daran?  You seem well traveled."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, well," he cracks more sticks ands adds them to the burgeoning fire.  "Been here, been there.  Been living south of here for quite a number of years.  Thundertree, if you ken of it.  Most of it's overrun now.  You ever cooked coney?"  He pulls out a small cookpan.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I've mainly stayed with flora rather than fauna over the years, but those do look delectable. Thundertree you say? Sounds familiar, but I can't be sure. Do you happen to have a map you could point it out with?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Also, if you're familiar with these parts, have you seen this place?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He holds out the veteran's second map.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He chuckles.  "This is...  bad.  This is chicken scratch!  Let me see..."  He pours over it, scratching his chin.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He seems very old, his face only shows very thin stubble.  And his ears are just the slightest bit enlongated with a point to their tips.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Im sorry, son, can't help you with that map.  Heres the one I have."  And he pulls out a fairly well taken care of and updated map of the Sword Coast North.  Thundertree is on the southern side of the Neverwinter River, just to the West of the Neverwinter Wood.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I am familiar with this area.  What are you looking for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well.." </p><p></p><p><i>He takes another look at the pointed ears.</i></p><p></p><p>"The short of it is, my brother in arms has been taken by a monstrosity into the clutches of a thug lord of some sort. They came from the North. Have you seen any of these brigands riding about? And do you know of any stables in the area?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oakhurst is probably the best, to the north there.  But I do know the brigands you're speaking of.  A monstrosity, you say? That big iron man?  You say it took your friend?  You sure he isn't dead?  Pardon my asking, don't mean to be so forward."  He looks intense as hes asking the questions, then abashed as he realizes its about your friend.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Agh...Oakhurst...where it all started. Honestly I don't know if he's dead, but they did something to stabilize him before they left. It seemed they wanted him alive for...something."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue thinks back to the mounts they left outside the manor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Tell me, would you accompany me as a scout back toward Oakhurst? I'm sorry to be so abrupt, it's just...I fear time is not on our side. My companion and I left some horses by the old manor house the other day. Surely they've found their way back to the stables by now, but perhaps not...One way or another, I need to speak to Vam and Heston. Pray, come with me and tell me of these brigands on the way."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He roasts the rabbits, tosses them a bit, then moves one to his plate, offers you the pan.  He seems deep in thought.  After a couple bites he brings out hardtack, offers you a bit.  </p><p></p><p>"I can travel to Oakhurst, sure.  I'll tell you what I know about the brutes too.  But you can count those horses as losses.  Whole area around that old manor is home base for those brigands."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you, and I feared that might be the case. Damn...I will be loath to mention this to Vam... To be honest, I would love to get away from all this madness and go see the coast with my friend, yet...I seem pulled back, ever pulled back by these brutes. I must take this business to its resolution."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I won't rush you, you've been over kind already, but it will be good to have a companion on the road."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ranger nods and finishes with his meal, deep in contemplation.  The meal ends, you both clean up and break the site down.  Daran is particular to not leave any traces of either of your presence, so he takes some extra time fixing the scene to dissuade animals or other people from trying to follow any tracks.  When he finishes, he nods to Lumao, then hefts his pack and head NW, along the bank of the stream.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It's better that we're on this side of the river, the thugs are doing random checks for groups travelling.  Since they know your face, it' probably a good idea to use something to change your appearance as much as possible.  I'm okay in the use of camouflage, but if you have any ideas, I'd suggest we try them first, maybe."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Lumao seems to waver in the morning light, his armor turning into a hunter’s jerkin and his face tuning into that of a older half-elf woman.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He stows his trademark weaponry in favor of daggers and a heavy crossbow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A few prismatic traces linger on the edges as the slender form comes round. A bevy of golden white hair tumbles and gradually comes to a rest as the last of the light pierces out from the eyes. There are a few scars here and there upon her face, befitting the  nomadic look, but under the all-but-transparent crow’s feet there is a luminous beauty radiating under the skin. A sadness of long life, but a joy of constant rebirth.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That'll...  Um...  yeah.  That'll do."  Flustered a bit, the ranger remembers himself and continues, stoically, down the road.  "Now's as good a time as any to discuss the bastards over at the old mansion.  You start, maybe I can fill in the gaps."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“<i>Fill in the gaps...?</i>”</p><p><i>Ouelue gestures coyly...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>...then ribs the flustered Daran.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“IIIII’m just fuckin with ya....”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Winks</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“What can you tell me of this foul lot?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He now looks <i>very</i> flustered.  He's not used to other people travelling with him, let alone a female half-elf.  Even though he knows it's not.  But does he, really?  As I said, he's very flustered!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well...  <i>Ahem</i>, well now, let's see...  They came around pretty quickly only a few days ago.  They stopped by Oakhurst then set up camp at the mansion same day.  Their numbers have been growing every day.  Seems like something new comes into the camp at an hourly pace, I don't know where they're getting their supply of followers from.   Wherever it is, the well is deep, apparently.  Plus, I hear tell of some extremely strange... misfits in the camp.  Were-folk, mages, some even suggest arch-mages, if you can believe that.  Could have sworn I saw a Red Wizard of Thay go into the main box they have up on the hill.  Use that as the inner sanctum, I s'pose.  It's been covered over by now with tents and canopies and the like.  It's either a small festival, or a large traders outpost, depending on what you're more familiar with.  My fear is that they'll start to overrun Oakhurst, but they seem to be leaving it alone for the time being.  You say you think that's where they took your friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Honestly, who knows... The golem took him North. Could probably follow his tracks come to think of it. I’ve got this here net that might come in mighty handy. Might have to slip into this fine bit o’ splint first though if I’m going to covert route...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>(S)he considers this a moment, then begins to disrobe and slowly don the splint.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, oh dear.  Let me...   I'll just be down by the stream, there..."  He rushes down to the stream.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ouelue is getting a real kick out of this for some reason.

<div class="character-1"><p>"No, no.  You're fine lad.  The get-up.  Just...  reminded me of someone, was taken aback.  Way back, actually.  You're fine, son.  Let's continue on.  Be on the lookout for more brigands as we get farther north, aye?"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A ways down following the stream, you come to a path that leads due W.  Although it's away from Oakhurst, Daran says, "Let's take this route.  It's round about, but we should be out of the sights of the brigands."  He's quiet for a bit more, then starts walking.  "Her name was Lura.  She was my wife.  She was...  taken too soon.  It's a long story.  And one that hasn't been told before.  Not yet, at least.  Tell you what," he says, looking back at you, "We break your friend out, it'll be our next campfire story.  That's a promise."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I like you Daran. Thank you for opening yourself to me. Some day you can tell me why a traveler such as yourself would take one such as me on. I do think you have saved my life and Bahamut willing...Dieter’s too.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He smiles.  "There has to be good out there in the world.  Gods know I've seen too much bad, so there has to be good out there.  We just have to find it.  We're well met, Lamao."</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The sound of scraping wakes him up.  A food tray with bread and some moldy cheese is slid under the door, letting sparse light in.  From what he can tell, he's in a medium sized cell; hard oaken door with iron bandings, a barred window and a section at the bottom of the door where food plates can be delivered.  The walls are rough stone, but everything smells damp and mildew-y here. </p><p></p><p> He is tied to a dilapidated, rotten wooden bedframe.  He's bound in iron shackles.  His pack and items have been taken from him.  He is not alone.  As his eyes adjust, the druid can see a humanoid-sized lump of something on the bed across from him.  Soft breathing can be heard and seen from the lump.  </p><p></p><p>The bed to his right has a man, sitting cross-legged, carving something.  The man twirls a toothpick in his mouth and hums softly as he works.</p></div>
