<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter raises his scimitar with a look of desperate finality, then brings it down unhaltingly into his foe’s skull.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The carnage inside the small room is massive.  The goblin who gored itself lies under the two dogs, which you now see are wolves.  The blood pools on the rocky floor, the two adventurers breathe heavily as they assess the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is the first to spot things, using his druid sense.  It could also be Maouelue got knocked around a bit, lost a bit of blood.  Dieter spies the dead human.  There is a small chest next to the body.  There is also something shining in the walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspect the remains of the carnage for any clues as to the origin of these poor souls...and doesn’t say no to anything useful he might find while searching.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes particular interest in the small chest and walls.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The walls are silver ore veins. (Investigation check for more.)</p><p>The chest looks locked.</p><p>The creatures are standard animals, the goblin doesn't have any identifying marks on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any usable weapons</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You're going to need some supplies to get the ore out, Maouelue and Dieter see one lone spade and a pickaxe in the corner.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter also finds 5 silver on the goblin</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the chest for any sign of a trap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter slaps Maouelue’s hand out of the way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There seems to be a catch inside the lock.  Dieter finds something to jam into the keyhole, and something clicks and a low hiss starts coming from the chest.  </p><p>(Dexterity check to avoid, or another sleight of hand to try to diffuse.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lock abruptly explodes, sending shrapnel out in all directions.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Each of you take 6 points of damage.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the chest pops open, Maouelue and Dieter get struck by flying metal shards.  One pierces the wizards chest, and he falls to the ground.  A shard glances by Dieter's face.  As his face whips around to see his friend fall, he spies several potion bottles lining the bottom of the chest.  Some glisten red.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter searches frantically through the potions for something to save his friend, knowing that he was out of spell slots to cast his healing word.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are potions of healing in the chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a slightly quivering hand, Dieter uncorks and drizzles the contents of one of the bottles gently down Maouelue’s throat.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a shuttering breath, Maouelue's eyes pop open.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both lean over and peer into the chest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are at least four more potions of healing, two standard, two greater.  (I got the number wrong, too, it was supposed to be 2d4+2.  Give the wizard another hit!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are two potions of digging.  One bag of holding.  And a scroll of disguise self.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and the wizard, although going quickly, investigate the area thoroughly.  The two cannot tell if the human is Douglas or not, but they take the corpses features down to relay them to the people in the town, just in case.  The ore veins will take a few hours to mine, the best that you could hope for at the point is to take a few hours and get 6 pounds of ore for the both of you.  (Approx 6 gold).  There is a curious section that looks like it has already been mined, but dirt and debris was piled back up quickly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With that check, it would take an hour to remove some of the debris from the cavity.  Two hours to completely remove everything.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The druid and wizard quiet their bodies and minds and reach out in the darkness for signs of life.  You're facing North.  The tunnels you've travelled are to the West and Northwest.  There is a tunnel directly ahead of you, one to the Northeast, and one due East.  There are muffled sounds coming from every tunnel.

<div class="character-1"><p>As the dust starts to settle, the last pebble stop rolling off the scree, you see a bony arm reach out of the wall.  More bones rattle and clatter together, magically forming into a skeletal mess of arms and legs.  At least one arm holds a sword.  It lumbers out of the wall at the two adventurers.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue gathers the skeletons ashes, he hovers his right palm above the medallion cautiously. Then inspects its markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers sift through the bones and rubble.  Dieter makes the discovery that there are many races of bones here - dwarves, humans, animals, goblins, many more.  Thinking back, the skeleton that attacked was a hybrid of several races, all attached at unnatural angles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is scoring on many bones.  Dieter sees that some scoring could have come from animals, but there a quite a few bones with notches clearly made with weapons.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin wasn't expecting such resistance, and definitely not magic.  He reels from the missile blasts, nearly falling back to the stone steps he just descended.  He shakes his head and snarls.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He runs toward Maouelue, twirling a javelin in his hands.  He overcompensates and tosses it right between the two of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter rushes to the staggering Goblin and slices across his midriff leaving a sizable gash.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The armored goblin clutches his side and as the ray of frost flies by him.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With most of his lifeblood on the ground, the goblin makes one last-ditch swipe at Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue hangs his head in shame.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Your enemy, seeing the attacks fail for you both, gets a second wind and roars.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The scimitar slices through the air, rending the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Douglas was added to combat with initiative 1d20 (9) + 20 = <code>29</code>.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>In his rage at seeing his companion crippled once again, Dieter slashes wildly at the goblin, missing horribly in his haste.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas uses his turn to do a medicine check to stabilize Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The goblin roars again, licks his scimitar and walks toward Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He feints as to hit Dieter, but at the last moment, he dodges to the right to try and end Douglas's life.  Douglas takes the blow as a cut across his forearm.  Bloody but still alive, Douglas covers the body of Maouelue as the goblin advances.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, obviously enraged and off kilter, spits on the corpse of his enemy.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>[150 xp to each]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter frantically runs over to his fallen comrade and looks imploringly at the man who has blessedly just stabilized his friend.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I...  I think so.  He needs medicine and rest.  I'll bandage as best as I can.  We should get him back to town as soon as possible, though.  What brought you two adventurers down here in the first place?  Not to say I'm not thoroughly grateful, many thanks for your aid here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at you in awed reverence.</p><p>"My name is Douglas.  You've talked with Culver?  They must have known I was missing when I didn't show up at the damned pub, I bet."  He chuckles.</p><p>"Probably the only good thing to ever come of my boozing, I guess.  Well, since you're my rescuers, I might as well share what got me in this trouble in the first place...  First, help me place your friend in a mine cart.  I'd be happy to push it to town."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, overwhelmed by this good news, gasps a bit in shocked relief.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shudders</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I really don't know much about any boss, but we've seen a lot of goblins around the mines lately.  Not sure what's driving them here.  The reason we came is this." He tosses you a coin.  On it are some runes, in a circular pattern. It is finely crafted and the etching was done by a professional. It is a standard silver. However, the markings are unlike anything you've seen before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter examines the coin more closely. He attempts to channel his Druidic origins in search of any memory of such an inscription.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, just then recalls quite how long they’ve really been in the mine. The initial shock of seeing his comrade fall has now receded, and an overwhelming exhaustion overcomes him. He staggers slightly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hey friend," Douglas says, easing Dieter down.  "I got it from here."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gingerly sets down in a shadowy corner and offers Douglas a torch from their packs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Much appreciated."  He grabs the torch from Deiter and a scimitar from a fallen gobin and sits at the top of the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, feeling exposed, but incapable of caring particularly much about it, blacks out in exhaustion. His dreams are filled with muffled gnashes of teeth and strange languages emanating from shapeless forms...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stirs restlessly, half a wizard eye open while otherwise incommunicative.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers spent their first part of the rest in fitful slumber, but eventually their minds settle and they get the rest they need.  They both wake up alert, rested, and feeling oddly stronger. (I believe you have enough xp to level up?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas sits at the head of the stairs, sharpening his new scimitar with a makeshift whetstone.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Slowly the two adventurers rise to the rhythmic sound of Douglas sharpening his blade. Their eyes meet and they seem to instantly recognize that they each have grown significantly as a result of this venture. A slow grin breaks across Dieter's face...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The adventurers look to Douglas and ask whether he is keen to push a bit further into the mine, to put an end to this 'Boss' and avenge the desperate souls who lay slain in the chambers above.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, we can traverse the mines.  Not much to them, really, this part at least.  This is a fairly new dig.  There is a much bigger one across the hills, still a part of the Krytos Hill system.  I was there for a little bit, bunch of Dwarves in charge over there.  Here it was every man for hisself.  There something in particular you wanting to see, friend?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three of you roll the cart through the East tunnel of the Krytos Hill mine, putting bits in that you think might be useful.  There are some smallish silver nuggets, shovels and pickaxes, various miner-related gear.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the cart is being wheeled out to the main cavern area, you notice the campfire has completely gone out, there is no smoke emanating from it.  The bedrolls are still there, bites have been taken out of it, rips and tears that indicate of animal habitation.  The morning sun is peeking through the entrance, slightly shrouded as it is still fairly early.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They beckon to Douglas to follow them into the first corridor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Three travellers move down the West tunnel, past the other bedrolls, and approach the steep staircase.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter slips down the last few stairs, but Maouelue and Douglas right him.  As you enter this further tunnel, you see the carnage from the day previous.  The smell hits you, then you notice the carrion scavengers around.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes a closer look at the scavengers trying to discern their species.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They're actually kind of a mixed breed.  Rats bred with some other type of vermin.  They're not currently hostile toward your party.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter communes with the scavengers, imploring them to reveal anything they have experienced recently that might indicate whether there are more mortals remains in the area.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, chastened by his earlier brazenness wants to try and determine whether these creatures might be able to alert them to any potential ambush points in and around the cave.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter doesn't get words, more pictures and feelings from the animals.  They send a lot of struggling with their fellows, scavenging for food and shelter where they can.  They can to this cave, drawn by the smell, only very recently.  They only know the layout of this room, and the garbage pile a few tunnels over.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They do not sense nor have they seen any other living creature in these tunnels.  They've seen a lot of dead ones, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter attempts to tell them that his party means them no harm and they are just here as ore scavengers. He then nods to his party to move over to the silver vein and begin mining.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rat-things go back to their feast.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group divvies up their assorted tools and being chipping furiously away at the ore vein. They all seem to feel a deserving lust for the shimmering metal, buoyed by their recent hardships.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group mines for 4 hours taking turns at the pickaxe and sifting through the rubble keying in on the choicest nugs available.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As their arms begin to tire a bit, they suggest a break for some rations and to gather their findings into the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Your group digs for some time, narrowly missing stepping on these strange creatures that always seem to be underfoot.  A few hours in, you stop for a break.  Just as you all start again, Douglas's pickaxe lands on something wooden.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Maouelue rush over, and Dieter immediately remembers that there was a strange crevice or depression in the rock wall that they meant to investigate.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all dig in this one spot, finally uncovering an old chest.  Decorated in gothic iron scrollwork, it reminds all of you of the classic pirates chest in stories of old.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a huge, gaudy lock on the front, banded into the wood by thick iron bands.  The thing weighs a ton.  It takes all three of you to pry it from the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter examines the lock looking at the shape of the keyhole/mechanism. He wonders who put this here and whether a means of opening this chest might lie in these halls.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the gothic markings, running them against his knowledge of ancient scripts.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torchlight plays off the rough clay/dirt walls eerily.  The iron and wood of the chest seem to drink it in, making the room dim.  A breeze wafts past the three of you, source- less, but no one notices.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue drools slightly as he falls into a stupor while considering the markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's pulse quickens...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can't grasp the markings on the bands of iron, they're eroded away too much.  Something, some nugget of a memory pops into Dieters mind, completely unbidden.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He remembers a story of an artificer, a maker of magical items.  He was a sailor, a pirate really, who searched far and wide for a special magic that would make his items renown the world over.  Across the seas, a land of giants harnessed the power of runespells.  Their brand of runic magic was so powerful, it was said to imbue items with a life of their own.  They didn't use their magic for wealth or power, but mainly protection from the outside world.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This pirate found their enclave, slew their leaders, and forced the shamans of the tribe to divulge all of their secrets.  In the years that followed, not only did the pirate become rich and powerful, he became unstoppable.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There came a day that the crew became so frightened of him, half of them mutinied while the other half fled as fast as they could.  Alone, listless on the high seas, the artificer's last days are unknown to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is something etched around the lock.  Dust and dirt obscure the writing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter rubs the corner of his shirt over the lock, then pours a dash of water from his skein to rinse off the residue. He peers intently...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue can make out a couple runes, but not all.  <i>R-NE--R-</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas is about to say something, then stops, the thought fading before it really begins.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party loads whatever they can muster along with the chest and heads back to the cave entrance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter disappointedly hangs his head and unwittingly lays eyes on his Henchmen Mirror. Oddly the face(s?) staring back at him is(are?) not his own...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Four henchmen (Please feel free to describe their look) appear out of thin air.  Douglas nearly jumps out of his skin, wondering how in that hell that happened.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With all seven of you working together, you manage to not only lift the chest but you all put it in the mine cart.  The four henchmen take positions at the rear, ready to push it into town for you.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Deleted counter inspiration.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The men merrily roll out to the front of the cave, the henchmen particularly enthusiastic about their good fortune!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party heads back to Oakhurst, the small town where you first met Culver and heard about Douglas's plight.  As you crest the ridge of the hill and head into outskirts of the town, children see your party coming and run up to you, throwing questions at you left and right.  Some run ahead to tell the townspeople of your coming.  By the time the seven of you finally get into the town proper, you're legends.  The wealth in your cart is more than most people in Oakhurst see in a lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are questions upon questions upon questions.  Offers of free drink and food at the Pig and Falcon come from the owner and patrons alike.  Merchants come up to you offering their wares at a discount, slyly peeking at the glorious wealth in your cart.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Oakhurst</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You search for Culver, he's nowhere to be found amongst the adoring crowd.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone quiets a bit and looks around from one to the other.  They call out for Culver, a few even send for him at his storefront.  Cheers go up and rise when the word of the Pig and Falcon come up.  Seems like the crowd will be heading there directly to save a good spot.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Some people did see the chest.  Dieter gets a <i>very</i> lowball offer for it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The crew heads to the Pig and Falcon. Maouelue asks Douglas to arrange a room and a private entrance if possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are people literally falling out of Pig and Falcon.  Standing room only.  There is a table saved in absolute center of the room, waiting for your arrival.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head to The Sleeping Sheep and Maouelue enters to inquire about lodging. Dieter hangs back outside to guard the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue enters in and secures lodging for the minecart and the two original adventurers, a younger boy runs up to Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He doubles over, catches his breath, and blurts out, "Culver's shop...  Robbed..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Just got back from checking... Didn't see it happen.  Don't know what happened.  Name's Seeder?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He gives you a weird look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Co stable?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah...  We take care of our own here, m'lord.  I'll get my pa!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He nods and runs toward the tavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter shuffles toward the Inn entrance and cracks the door open to peek in on how Maouelue is faring.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees the keen look on Dieter’s face and hurries back to the entrance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The crew shuffles their mine cart and sundries to the room. Dieter and Maouelue tell the henchmen to stand guard over the cart while they inspect Culver’s.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a crowd now outside, pitchforks and a couple machetes are wielded.  They usher you to Culver's shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Named Cork and Tow, it sells fishing and farming supplies.  There are wood planks over the front windows, the storm shades.   It has not been storming.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blank looks look back at you.  One peeps up, "Saw him last night, he was at The Pig."  Some yells of assent.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The front door is ajar.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party moves in and begins to investigate.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party enters in one by one to a room of chaos.  What was treated with love and care has been torn apart, piece by piece.  Detritus litters the floor, shelving is knocked over.  Large casks of some oily substance have been broken over, the contents seeping over what is now refuse.  The walls have been gouged by implements of some sort, leaving long gashes throughout.  At one time a quaint metal candle holder hung from the ceiling, now it hangs askew, almost touching the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Several people try to peek in, you hear gasps and hurried voices from behind the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p></p><p><i>They ask Douglas to keep the townsfolk out of the scene of the crime and suggest that those willing fan out and keep an eye around the perimeter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods and goes to do crowd control.  (Inv checks for Dieter and Maouelue.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is just too much going on in this room.  (Give me another for each, just for fun!  If you want to focus on something else, too, let me know.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p><p><i>Dieter moves toward the back of the shop looking for any additional rooms or crannies.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Deiter is starting to think that maybe an animal got in and got loose on some things.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue, closing his eyes, starts to tap into the Weave to give him some insight into what happened in this humble shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In his mind's eye he starts to see ethereal, hooded figures move around the room, as if searching for something.  There are several figures behind the counter area in violence with a darkened figure on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a hulking figure that comes in some time later, from the back, tears through the place, and grabs the figure on the ground by a leg.  Tossing the shape over its shoulder, it lumbers out the back again, the rest of the figures follow.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is now a cacophony of noise coming from outside the shop.  Douglas is not doing a great job on crowd control.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd disperses, but reluctantly.  Many faces turn back over their shoulders, trying to glimpse what is happening.  Seeder remains behind a bit, but his father pulls him away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter motionlessly watches Seeder recede, until at last he disappears around a corner. At that instant Maouelue beckons the group silently to follow him off the street and around the back of Culver’s shop.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The other two men nod in acknowledgment and follow straight way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue nods in assent and they head off toward the inn taking care to obscure their progress as much as possible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You make it to the Sleeping Sheep without being seen, you believe.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They head in and apprise the proprietor of their intent to grab a few things and quickly leave again so that he shouldn’t be bothered fixing anything up for the crew.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They enter their room and begin stowing what ore they can carry. About 20lbs each. They beckon a henchmen to follow along with them as they exit, leaving three henchmen behind.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>On their way out the door, Dieter asks the owner if there is a woodworker or smithy in town they might barter with.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course, lad.  If you're looking for woodworking or carving, that would be Kentham.  Our resident smithy is a brawny lass named Saynea."  He draws up a quick map of the town for your and points you to the shops.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He bows his head to you and says, "Well met, young lad.  Name's Denson Amman."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, we'll keep your things safe and secure, don't you worry.  And the light'll be on all night.  Feel free to come and go as you need.  If I'm not here, my daughter, Kirra, will be manning the desk.  You have a good eve as well.  Stay safe."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They nod and exit the inn. Dieter leads, flanked just behind by Douglas and the henchman, whom Dieter has nicknamed in his mind Frenchman the Henchmen or Frenchy for short, Maouelue brings up the rear, holding on loosely to his companion’s sudden zeal.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter leads on first to the smithy and takes note of the kind of quality craftsmanship he might expect as he approaches, examining the building.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The building is simple, sturdy, and empty save for the burly woman at the anvil.  The front of her building is completely open, letting people see her work and craftsmanship. </p><p> Hot metal is being beaten with fine precision.  Her red hair is tied in a tight bun, muscles ripple in her arms and shoulders.  Her smock and face are covered in sweat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She doesn't hear you coming, the sound of the hammering and the forge are loud.  Plus she is extremely focused.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks up and wipes the sweat from her brow with an arm. </p><p>"Aye, what can I help you boys with?"  She goes back to hammering.  "Sorry, I have a limited time with this as it's hot now.  Let me know what yer looking for, or have a look around.  Everything's for sale."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They inspect the goods for sale and Dieter steps up to Saynea.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She picks up her head, interested.  "I've had occasion to silver some weapons.  I can make ewers or goblets, might take a bit 'o time, though.  I can do well with detail work, but the more detail, the more time I need.   What did you have in mind?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She stares at you.  Then slowly starts nodding.  Grabbing a piece of parchment from her front counter, she starts jotting down ideas, then starts drawing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a decent representation of what you want.</p><p>"If you want it quick, it'll be 2 pounds of silver ore.  Cost'll be 2 gold and I keep the remaining ore.  Could get it to you in day and a half.  Better detail work, say 3 gold and 3 days."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>no</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Overwrite unconfirmed. Aborting.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the drawing from Saynea and considers it, idly sketching a few changes to the angles here and there. He also seems to be inscribing something intently.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Pardon," she says to Dieter, moves over to the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Okay, lad, we got chain armor at 50 gold, scale mail is the same price there.  Goes up a bit with the breastplate, solid steel there, that'll run you 480 gold.  Have some shields, too.  Couple double mounted, good oak core.  15 gold for those.  Solid steel is going to be 25.  I can engrave or detail anything you want, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Now, weapons, if I don't have it in stock, I can make it right quick.  Short and long swords are over there, 10 and 15 gold respectively.  I have maces, cudgels.  Do a fine bit o' work with staffs and range weaponry too.  Just basically depends on what you fancy.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Anything else, let me know, I can probably draw up some plans to suit your needs, like we're doing for your friend there."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Sure thing, be right there."</p><p><i>To Maouelue</i> "Take your time.  When you have things together, bring them on up and we'll get you squared away."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"...," looks around, "No...  I don't have a sling, actually.  Woodworker might be able to help you there. Sorry about that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Deal."  She holds out her hand, smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Say half now, gimme three days.  I'll let you inspect it first before the final payment?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands over 10 chunks of silver in payment and 2 lbs worth of ore.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Saynea is surprised at first, but she looks it over.  Nodding, she smiles and brings the supplies over to her forge to prep.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye, sure.  Let's see what you have."  She's still getting things together at the forge, but it's an open workspace and everyone can roam freely around, even right up to where she's working.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue chooses a long sword of his liking and offers Douglas his pick of one standard weapon as a gesture of thanks for his companionship in this unfolding journey.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas clasps the wizard's shoulder, gives it a squeeze, and says, "Many, many thanks, my friend.  But no need.  I have my souvenir from Krytos."  He pats the goblin scimitar with his other hand, smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Something deep within Maouelue’s spirit stirs at this selfless gesture.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She ponders for a moment.  "Actually, would these work at all?"  She shows you small remnants of her smelting, similar to ball bearings.  Various sizes are strewn on the floor.  She grabs a few of the bigger ones and says, "Would these work, or do you need them a certain weight or size?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'll have to make a mold, but I could get those done in a day.  Tomorrow, by the time I close, I'll have 'em ready for ya.  I'll keep the remaining silver as payment, or make it one gold and I'll give you the molding box?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Aye, I’ll take the box as well. Many thanks m’lady! We shall return on the morrow!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Excitedly the crew turns and leaves the smithy, Maouelue with new long sword in hand along side his quarterstaff, and Dieter with a serene glow in his eyes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Further down the SW/NE road (named Shepherd's Pass by the locals), near the end of the northern stretch of road, is a beautifully kept storefront with a variety of fun wood knickknacks on display.  The enclosed porch has a plethora of wood workings, everything from kids puzzles to attachments for farming implements.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is an old woman sitting on a well polished rocking chair, asleep.  Dogs run around the side yard and you hear a yell from the back of the house, "Dammit, stop that catterwallin' ya crazy animals!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group enters the store taking care not to wake the sleeping woman. They examine the wares idly for a few moments and Maouelue peruses for a sling, or the like.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The whole house seems to be a both a storefront and living quarters.  A small bell rings when the door is opened, and a minute or so later, an old man enters from the back.  He doffs his floppy hat, nods his head toward the group, and says, "Howdee folks, what can I do for ye?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, aye, got slings, blowshots, slingshots - both hand and stick.  Got some real nice light crossbows, longbows, and shortbows as well.  I do the woodworking and carving,  Saynea helps with the metal parts where it needs it.  M' wife Benna does the stitching and weaving, and she does a right fine job. Got a beauty of a net she just wove, won't break unless you're netting a dragon, handiwork guaranteed!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old man, with his white wispy hair blowing gently in the breeze and  sparse white beard, looks astonished down at the gleaming silver in the wizard's hands.</p><p>"A... Aye, stranger, that'll do kindly."  He looks through the group again, as if trying to recognize or at least remember your faces.  "Please, take a look around, see if there's anything else that catches your fancy!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He quickly takes the silver ore from Maouelue and says, "Thank ye, and the net is out front next to Benna."  He hands you two slings as well. (3 silver ore, correct?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group begins to head out the door. Dieter remembers something and turns back momentarily.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The old man scratches his head for a beat.</p><p>"Not an established apothecary, but there's old Trix in the forest.  She might be able to fix you up with something.  Glad to hear these bits will do some good, too much evil in the world today.  You folks ever need anything, come on back.  This is The Bending Oak, and my name is Kentham.  Happy to know you fellas."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The slings are sturdy but unremarkable.  The net, you now notice, is expertly made.  What is normally a gold piece at a regular city shop, and is typically made of rough rope, this...  Fine leather strands mixed with hempen rope twine is interweaved with multihued gossamer thread the likes of which you've never heard of before.  It catches the light at strange angles, and you realize you can partially see through sections.  (Anyone proficient in arcana can make an check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is a net of invisibility.  The gossamer threads, upon closer inspection, are strands of the old woman's hair.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group departs the shoppe and makes haste toward the forest mentioned by the shopkeep. Dieter mumbles something about hoping his henchmen are faring well in their protection of their goods before heading out of town.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue hands Dieter a sling and the net, hanging on to his own and pulling out his new longsword for closet inspection. As they wander toward the forest, they keep an eye out for any appropriately-sized stones for their slings. Dieter has a particular interest in getting stones.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's getting on dusk now, and the village is still congregating at The Pig and Falcon.  Avoiding their gazes for the time being, the three adventurers move on NE (after getting basic directions from Kentham) in the directions of the forest.  Dieter finds 20 stones suitable to his liking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands 10 stones to Maouelue</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Deleted counter stones.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The farmlands pass to thick dales of grasslands, several animals graze at their leisure.  In sort order a copse of trees comes into view.  Beyond that, much larger and darker trees take over the skyline and the forest proper starts.  An eerie feeling comes over the group as rain clouds, travelling towards the party, appear over the trees.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes note of what kinds of animals are grazing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group hurries toward the forest in hope of avoiding the rainfall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few cows and sheep.  (Perception for more, if you want.  Who is leading, or are they going side-by-side?  Douglas is behind everyone, we'll say.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group has now fallen into their standard formation with Dieter in the lead flanked by their two companions right behind and Maouelue bringing up the rearguard.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cows and sheep have a brand, BSR.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A murder of crows can be seen high on the branches of the trees as the group enters the forest.  There is a piece of bark nailed to the first tree.  Dirt obscures the words scrawled on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue spies the unusual signage and moves over to brush off the dirt to uncover its markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The message is in common.  <i>Stay on the path</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all can now see other writing on the barks of the trees, some scrawled, some written in a dark substance.  (Percep check)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue starts feeling queasy.  Dieiter gets right up to one of the scrawls.  <i>Turn back</i></p><p>Another, written in blood. <i>She lives this way</i></p><p>There are arrows in red pointing the way deeper into the trees.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group, senses heightened at this unsettling script, moves forward keeping eyes out for both Trix’s domicile and anything that might be lurking in the woods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pull out a torch and hand it to the...hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With an eye for the dramatic, the duo perform an unnecessarily magical lighting and carrying of the torch.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They each side-eye their companions in search of signs of reverence.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas stares, open-mouthed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The Frenchman always looks at Dieter with reverence.  The display does increase it, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Grinning slightly the pair lead on further into the newly lit woods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The others peer tentatively around them, the flames now creating eerie parallactic shadows as they pass through the trees.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter says this, a crack of lightning breaks.  The forest is illuminated for a brief second and several screeches are heard from over heard.  A moment later, thunder rumbles.  A darkness settles over the forest with only the torchlight for guidance.  For the moment...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>There is nothing to do at this moment but carry on for the troupe. Their pace  naturally quickens in response to the ominous...omen.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the mage hand leading the way (and Douglas in almost darkness), the troupe follows the bloody arrows further in, towards 'Trix' and the incoming storm.  (Another Survival for everyone.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter whirls around, checking the trees again.  He rolls his eyes, then continues down the <i>correct</i> path.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This path diverges from the main forest path.  Tension starts creeping into the bodies and minds of the adventurers.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A peal of thunder.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The irony of the mysterious merchant’s name only now settles upon Dieter. At hearing the name aloud in this way Maouelue furrows his brows, if possible, deeper than they had already been. His pace falters for a few steps before he resolves to press on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group hastens their pace in deference to the oncoming storm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party picks up the pace as the thunder rolls.  Tree after tree passes.  The three go deeper and deeper into the woods.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter's eyes are completely focused on the signs, not missing a one.  He thinks.  So far.  (One more survival check, please.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter lets out an exclamation of triumph...  then horror as a decrepit homestead comes into view.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The other three bump into him as they catch sight of it as well.  </p><p></p><p>And then the clouds loose a fury.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The deluge starts immediately.  A massive amount of water pours from the sky in seconds.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With nothing else for it, they book it for the creepy domicile.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunder and lightening crash.  Dieter catches his bearings and just as he's about to run, the illumination from the lightening shows them a figure beckoning them to the structure.  They bolt, splashing through the mud and water into the strange building...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party stumbles in, almost on top of themselves, into the foyer of an... interesting abode.  From the outside, it looks smallish.  A combination of a ramshackle shed with a colorful peddlers cart with what seemed to be a circus boxcar attached in the rear.  When you enter in, however, you all see a cozy, if earthy, entrance with strange baubles and bobs hanging from the ceiling and in various bowls scattered hither and thither.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A wide set of earthen steps descends to a sitting room set with wicker chairs around a roaring fire.  A table with a bubbling pot stands to the right, no clear source of heat underneath it.  Herbs, fungi, a complete assortment of plants and other particulars are scattered everywhere around the table, and, truthfully, the room in general.  The ceiling is higher in this main sitting area, and no rain is getting through.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>To the left, standing stock still, hands clasped in front of her, is a beautiful young maiden.  Hair as black as pitch, clothes patchworked but otherwise clean and neat, she is a vision save for bits of dirt marring her stark white skin.  She looks to be middle age, but when you look again, she looks to be barely an adult.  She waits patiently for you all to enter, eyes unblinking.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he speaks, he subtly examines the young woman, not fully believing the facade she presents. He has seen a hag or two in his days and his arcane senses tingle...or did that last lightning strike come a little TOO near?</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, who has always been a bit vulnerable to beauty, unwittingly slackens his jaw. Whatever he had been expecting, this figure is not it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The woman nods her head.  "M' name is Bellatrix, but the townsfolk call me Trix.  Why do you come so deep into the woods to find me?"  Her eyes, still unblinking, you can see have an odd greenish tint to them.  Unnaturally bright green, reminiscent of firebugs at night or the pallor of a sickly person.  She seems healthy, though.  (Perception check for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard doesn't catch it, but Dieter notices Douglas acting very nervous.  He's grabbing his left elbow with his right arm, not making eye contact with anyone, and not looking around at anything.  There is so much to see in this place, it just strikes Dieter as strange.  He also notices several potion bottles ready to be stoppered.  They're red, swirling, and you know them as potions of healing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She laughs, looking at the floor for a beat.  She makes her way to the table, stoppers four bottles, and bring them to Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and says to Maouelue, "I'm sorry, goodsir, I don't study in the arcane much.  Mine is a...  different type of magic.  Some shy away from it, but it has been with me and my family for years upon years, generation upon generation.  A curse, some would tell you.  It has served me well, though.  And hopefully it serves you well, too."  She nods to the bottles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes the bottles in hand and offers fair payment. Maouelue’s eyes gaze piercingly into Bellatrix’s. He has an inkling of what she might mean, but is eager not to let on to his fellows the precarious nature of their visit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He nods at the armful of potion bottles with which Dieter is wrangling.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Her smile fades.  She looks at the silver ore and gives it back to Dieter.  "Although it is very much appreciated, kind sir.  I have no such use for silver or gold, though."  She shrugs and says, in a soft voice, "No place to use it."  She looks at Maouelue, studying him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, after an uncomfortable minute or so, she says, "Do you by chance have anything of Culver?  A piece of clothing of his?  Hair?  Something he owns?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas says, "Beggin' your pardon, miss...  um...  I... uh...  I have this... uh...  I have this trinket...  and, um...  and it... uh...  it belonged to Culver, ma'am."  He audibly gulps and holds out a small knife.  "Borrowed it some time back," he says to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two adventurers glance quickly at Douglas then at each other, then the witch, and back to Douglas again. Flabbergasted at this turn of fortune.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix smiles at the flustered man, nods as she takes the token.  To Dieter, she says, "We can discuss payment.  Let me see what fate lies in store for Culver.  Then we shall see what payment will be."  She takes the knife over to a darkened corner of the sitting room.  She pulls a dark cloth from what the group can see is an elaborately ornate mirror.  It gleams pristine in the firelight, not a mark or speck of dust is on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s eyes darken and he assumes a brooding posture.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix pinches the knife by the hilt, letting it dangle point downwards.  She holds it in front if the mirror.  She touches its opposite...</p><p>The reflection of the inside of the woman's house fades into dark clouds.  The clouds roil for a few moments, and when they clear, a scene emerges that is unnerving.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The view is several feet away, looking down on a bloodied Culver.  His hands are locked in manacles bolted to the wall above his head.  His clothes are tattered.  His head hangs to his chest.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party gasps each with their own peculiar terrors reflecting in their minds.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The surroundings are dark, dismal.  Some type of cell.  A metal clink is heard, and an unseen entity unlocks the manacles, letting Culver's hands fall to the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The view follows the Culver being dragged by his hands out of the cell, through a series of dank hallways, and finally thrown onto a wooden floor in front of a chair.  The chair is occupied by a tall man, his features are obscured.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A laughing voice asks Culver, "What did you think we would do, Big Dove?  Eh?  Just tell me where he is and we can finish all of this!  You can go home, clean up your shop!"  Laughing from around the room greet this statement.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell me where he is and who's working with him and you can walk out of here!  C'mon, man!  Let's get this <i>over</i> with!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter casts a furtive glance back at Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Culver moans.  He opens his eye, the other is swollen shut.  He pauses a moment.  Then spits blood at the  man in the chair.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room erupts in laughter.  Dark, deep, booming laughs, almost as if they were hoping for this action.  The man in the chair, the most jovial of all, steps closer to the man on the floor, kneels down, and now a full view of the man is available.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He has slicked back dark hair, thinning in front.  An almost handlebar, bushy moustache covers his pale face.   A few scars on his cheek and forehead mar his otherwise fairly handsome face.  Debonair, even.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks down at Culver with a smile that doesn't touch his eyes.  He grabs the man on the floor by his throat.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, a man in dark robes runs over to the mustachioed man and whispers in his ear.  His eyes go wide and he yells at the robed man, "WHERE?!  Find it!  End it NOW!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix drops the knife and the mirror turns back to its reflective surface.  She's breathing heavily and looking worried.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The companions are agitated and fretful at this nefarious revelation.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks genuinely shaken.  She takes a shuddering breath.  "I have no idea where that was, I didn't recognize anyone in the vision.  Did any of you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at Maouelue.  "They knew I was scrying on them.  They had a mage there that detected it.  I thought that was impossible."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix shakes her head, "No, I ended the scry when I felt him searching for it.  They haven't seen us and I don't believe they can reverse the spell."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas has been strangely quiet.  Could be that he's shy.  Could be something else.  (Perception check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Okay, okay, I think they're talking about me.  It's probably about those rune coins.  I recognize the man, but I have no idea who he is.  Just know him by reputation.  He's the one who originally sent us to the mine, wanted to find out more about those coins.  But after months of digging, we only found a handful.  No idea what he wanted, but it sounds like he's seriously angry about me not checking in.  Don't know why he would take it out on Culver, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I don't know, I honestly don't!  I wish I did, I...  I couldn't stand seeing Culver like that..." His voice breaks.</p><p>"I might know where I can get info, though.  We have to get back to Oakhurst."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The rush toward the door Maouelue looks back at Trix’</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She lowers her head, "I'm sorry, I cannot leave here.  I will continue to work to find Culver.  If I find anything else, I'll send word into town.  Be safe.  Come find me if you need any more supplies."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter sees Maouelue turn and join, he beckons the group to follow hit at pace and charges off down the path.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's coming down still, but not nearly as hard.  It's dark out, but Dieter leads the group expertly through the woods.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Yeah, okay!)  Everyone follows Dieter.  Douglas sees something coming closer to him, but the group is moving so well, the thing is left behind quickly.  The edge of town comes into view, and the pace is picked up.  Right at the entrance to town, by The Bending Oak, the crew stops to catch their breath.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas rights himself from being doubled over, taking in heavy breaths.  He stretches his back, nods at you, still winded, and starts moving toward The Pig and Falcon.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all see a mob of people spilling out of the tavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas slows, "Maybe we should go in through the back?..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party quickly follows to the tavern, thankful they will not be completely ghosting the adoring townsfolk, but heed Douglas' suggestion nonetheless.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas says, "How about this, we'll split up.  I'll take one of you and go around back, meet my contact.  The other can give this crowd what it wants, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter produces his trademark unnecessary flame in search of oohs and aahs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue follows Douglas silently around back, rolling his eyes at his ostentatious companion, but smiling inwardly a bit as well, as we are wont to do with the ones we love.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A farmer, about seven drinks past his limit, first spies Dieter and his flame trick.  He is over the top flamboyant in his praise and awe.  He taps all of his buddies on their shoulders, getting more people into the throng of wonder.  More people from inside the establishment hear the commotion and try to barrel their way out to see.</p><p>(Performance check, if you want to do anything fancy!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is not so used to wielding his flames in such small spaces, but he manages a passable flame formed bear for their amusement.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A hush rolls through the crowd when Dieter moves his hands rapidly around his ball of flame.  A bear appears, then grows, as Dieter plies his craft.  The bear grows to four feet high, amazing the people.  It moves forward into the tavern, carving a way for Dieter.  As he makes his comment, a roar goes up and a mug of ale is stuffed into your right hand, a strong smelling cup of something jammed into your left.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two stealthy blokes enter in the rear of The Pig and Falcon silently, surprising the bulbous cook.</p><p>"Oy, you two!  Give a man a heart attack!  Can't you see I'm working me arse off here!  I don't need surprises, too.  Get outta here!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods to the cook and quickly heads to the busy main room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Not one to shy away from an adoring crowd, Dieter shows them his "drink two beers at once" trick.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter... tries to do his trick, but these mugs are covered in a heavy lacquer and laden in grease.  One slips, then the other.  Most of the ale covers you, some of it douses the bear in a gout of sputtering smoke.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd goes quiet for a second.  Then a GIANT roar goes up, Dieter's back is slapped, and <i>three</i> more ales are set on the table for you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another big cheer, and a mead in a large mug is set up in front of you.  One of the farmers calls for news of the minecart you rode in on.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas scans the area for his contact...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... and sees an obese man in clothes a lot finer than what you've seen in this town so far. He slowly makes his way over.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He then regales them with a bit of an exaggerated recount of their latest encounters.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter keeps the majority of the crowd in rapt attention.  Some are being kicked out due to drinking too much, making a bit of noise to contend with you.  But the greatest number is rapt, listening to your tales.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stumbles in his speech a bit and lets out a giant belch, rubbing his stomach thereafter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas taps the big man on the shoulder and whispers something in his ear.  The man, without looking at Douglas, pulls a piece of parchment out of his vest and hands it to Douglas.  Douglas looks at Maouelue, surprised and somewhat worried.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue flicks his eyes meaningfully toward the loos.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, stumbling a bit more now, seeks an open seat near the hearth.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, suddenly realizing he is famished, tries to catch the barkeep's eye.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas takes the nod, sees where Maouelue is directing, and heads there.  You catch him give the big man a backwards glance.  The man never looks at Douglas. (Perception check for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue has been clocking the big man's eye movements.  He seems to be watching Dieter very closely.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard and Douglas approach the loos.  Douglas pulls out the parchment, which is folded several times over.  He unfolds and looks at it, puzzled.  He shows it to Maouelue.  (History check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is a dark blotch of ink in the middle of the page.  Nothing else, no writing.  Searching his memory, there is something there, something relating to the sea maybe?  The wizard can't quite put his finger on it, though.  Not precisely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Meanwhile, Dieter, ever presentational, makes a show of ordering what seems to be enough food to feed 3 men, going on about how he hasn't had a bite in near a day and a half.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas nods.</p><p>The bartender, a harried man with sparse, flyaway brown hair and a sweaty complexion, nods as Dieter orders.  His eyes go wider and wider with each additional item.  He tries to interject a few times, but Dieter goes right through with his food order.  The people at the bar take notice and start cheering the druid on!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue whispers a few words to Frenchy and hand him the 5 silver coins he is carrying. The henchman circumnavigates the crowd over to Dieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy shows the silver pieces to the barkeep.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bartender, completely flabbergasted, calls to the cook the giant order, and says its to go.  The cook comes to the window and says, "WHO THE HELL ORDERED ALL THIS FOOD -- TO GO?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cook looks through the partition, sees it's Dieter talking and says, "Oh.  It's you.  Okay, but it's gonna take some time.  Gimme a minute."  And he trails off, going back to the kitchen.  The crowd cheers again.  Someone pulls out a handmade lute, a couple drums come out, and a flute-like instrument is produced as well.  Music and merrymaking begin at The Pig.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, picks his head up and is shaken to see a flaming bear in front of him. Realizing the increasingly dangerous nature of manipulating an open flame around so many people, he ends his conjuration and stifles a few large belches.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy steps back into a nearby corner and observes the bar as surrogate bodyguard for his summoner.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bear is dispersed, you hear some groans from the audience, still intent on what Dieter is doing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tugs at the elbow of Douglas' shirt and beckons he follow out the back and toward the Sleeping Sheep.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, his precaution ebbing away, blurts out...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What news of our friend Culver?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy's ears and eyes perk up at the sound of Culver's name.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Even with being tipsy, Dieter can spy a couple large looking men making their way over to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter turns his head, looking to meet Frenchy's gaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men cross paths with Maouelue and Douglas, on their way out.  (Perception check for Mao.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue steps past the two large men, but Douglas slows, recognizing that they're with the obese man.  He slows, grabbing the sleeve of Maouelue.  They watch the progress of the men toward Dieter.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first plate of food hits the bar in front of Dieter, and the barkeep says to the Frenchman, "You know, 5 silver won't cover his <i>whole</i> order," and leaves in a huff to the kitchen.  Bar patrons shout after him for service.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Douglas hasten out the back door and run around to the front entrance hoping to be at their companion's back before the burly men are able to make their way across the crowded bar room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men saunter up to where Dieter is sitting, remove the patrons next to him at the bar, to much verbal violence.  They sit, staring straight ahead, not paying much attention to their surroundings.  Occasionally they'll pass a glance between them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter jibes offhandedly in the brutes' general direction.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No response from either.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Mouelue enters the front of the tavern and bids Douglas keep out of sight near the door. He edges his way around the wall and sidles up to Frenchy, whispering to him to tell Dieter it's time go go.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tension mounts.  Patrons continue their drinking and merrymaking.  The music starts to come to a crescendo.  The two men continue to sit and stare into the ether. (Perception check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They don't seem to be taking notice of any one or anything around them, except for Dieter.  It's almost as if they're listening intently.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter glances over at Frenchy, realizing he has not seen Maouelue and Douglas in awhile, and is surprised to see his companion and henchmen watching him apprehensively. He furrows his brow, questioningly...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue cast a searching glance around for the proprieter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy attempts to signal silently that they need to leave...NOW.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A "Huzzah" goes up at the mention of another tune.  Douglas whispers to Maouelue, "The owner is the barkeep, Kennet.  Looks pissed, eh?"  The barkeep plops another plate down, this one greasy, fried fish bits and golden roasted potatoes.  The smell is heavenly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men take turns cracking their knuckles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter loses his patience.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s head drops.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one right next to Dieter leans back and looks toward the big man.  A glance passes between the two...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy take a few steps nearer to Dieter and makes himself known.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man next to Dieter taps his counterpart on the shoulder.  That man proceeds to take the stool he's on and <i>hurl</i> it across the room towards the people surrounding the musicians.  Simultaneously, the man next to Dieter tries to grapple him.  (Dexterity check.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bar stool connects with more than a half dozen patrons, knocking them down, gouging and bludgeoning people left and right.  The place erupts.  Some people that were thrown out that were hanging around outside come barreling through the door, looking for a fight.  The barkeep and cook work quickly at closing the entrance to the kitchen, locking themselves in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Pandemonium reigns.  Dieter is grabbed, but slips through the clutch before there is purchase.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy kicks out the man who threw the stool, aiming for the back of his knee and attempts to pull him backward.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas, knowing these guys might be after him next, eyes the door and bolts.  (Since there are a lot of bodies in here, I'm treating it as difficult terrain.  The tavern is roughly 60x40ft, the door, from the PCs, is roughly 40ft away.  Douglas can usually move 30, halved is 15, then with the dash is another 15.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas claws his way to the front, around flying haymakers and flying bodies.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The far man, unwisely, brings out his scimitar, causing a panic in the area around him.  He swipes out at the wizard, catching his lower leg.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter channels his memory of the dune grass along the coast of his domain, it seeps up from the floor and grabs the man who flung the stool by the legs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man trying to grab Dieter suddenly sees strange costal grass growing rapidly from between the cracks in the floor.  He dodges out of the way, deftly, but, in doing so, ends up putting more distance between himself and the druid.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man then looks around.  Seeing he's not near Dieter, he dashes towards Douglas and is hot on his heels.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd is crazed, punches are being thrown, people are stampeding away from the crazy bloke with the sword.  It's utter insanity.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd surges, the pelts are coming left and right.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Douglas takes 3 points of damage, Dieter 1, Maouelue 6, and the Bad Guys...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... 16 points each, which means...)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You hear several burly men, farmers by the looks of them, call out, "Hey, the heroes need our help!  Everyone, let's get these arseholes!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The crowd surges again, and then, things seem to calm.  The tavern takes a collective breath, everyone looking around.  Most of the patrons have scattered, save a group of gnarly farmers who don't take no shit.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One of them, a man with leathery skin, tanned from decades in the sun, comes over dragging one of the men, unconscious, by the shirt collar.</p><p>"This the one giving you grief, lad?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ha, always!"  He goes around to his pack, pulls out some thick rope, and tosses it to you.  He kneels down, helping you hogtie the man.  The other one, with the scimitar, looks...  rough.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter has Frenchy and Douglas carry the bloodied man out the door and asks Frenchy to go to the Inn and remove the riches from the mine cart and bring it out to meet them in front of the Pig and Falcon.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I've had enough fun for one night, lads.  Name's Sy, I run the Broken Skull Ranch north side of town.  You need any help with these'ns or anything else, come on out and see us.  Else I'll see you in town." He dons his hat, tips it, and starts ambling northwards with a few other farmers and ranch-hands.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue begin to drag the Hog-tied man across town to Culver’s and ask Douglas to keep watch for Frenchy and the cart.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They all let up a holler and wave goodbye as they all start ambling back to their homes.  The night is crisply cold.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas is passed out from exhaustion just outside the tavern door, slumped in the dust.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter and Maouelue, without really speaking to each other, get a funny feeling that something at the end of the fight was off...  Nothing specific, but you both know that something was off.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue helps Dieter get the man across the threshold and then without a word hastens off back toward the Inn.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he departs he can hear the beginnings of a fierce interrogation, Dieter’s voice resonating with a beast-like character.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue nears the Sleeping Sheep.  The commotion has died down, the Pig's doors are wide open, the barkeep cleaning up inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Maouelue approaches the Tavern he looks for Douglas and Frenchy.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard looks for his other two companions.  Douglas is still passed out in the dirt in front of the tavern.  Frenchy is just starting to come out of the inn with the minecart, still laden with riches.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you get closer, you can see Douglas, passed out, slumped against the side of the tavern.  The hog-tied man is nowhere in sight.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue attempts to wake Douglas and bring him into the tavern. He sees Frenchy out of the corner of his eye and gestures for him to follow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas slumps over further, a dark, wet red patch spreading over the bottom part of his dark tunic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's head drops as he lets out a low moan. Fearing what he will find, he lays the man down and inspects the man's apparent wound.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's not much Maouelue can tell, he can't really get at the wound properly without taking off Douglas's tunic.  Moving him in this condition might be difficult and problematic.  You can tell, however, that his breathing is very shallow.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He's panicking a bit now. He tells Frenchy to keep Douglas stable, then runs headlong into the tavern.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He looks around for anyone who might help.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy does the best he can to staunch the bleeding, but there's no way for him to know if he's helping or hurting.  The wizard looks around, sees the barkeep sweeping inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He licks his lips and looks at you.  "Look at this place, will you?  I try to run a clean and honorable establishment, and you folks breeze into town, make havoc, and are carried out as heroes.  Leaving <i>me</i> to clean up the mess.  Just like always.  Adventurers.  Bah!"</p><p></p><p>He takes a beat, looks at the distress in Maouelue's face, and says, "Probably nothing a bandage and a good night's sleep won't fix.  But if you must, there is a priest of Ilmater at the parsonage down the way." (He points Northeast of town.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue storms out of the bar, losing control a bit, he works with Frenchy to load Douglas into the cart as gently as possible. They make as much haste as they can while trying to keep the cart steady and head off toward the parsonage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you travel down the road, nearing the dead of night, the events of the day seem to be getting to you.  You're feeling very tired and in need of sleep...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The three travelers make their way to a run-down shack at the edge of town.  Nothing denotes it as a shrine, no symbols or totems decry it's patron.  A small woman sits out front, legs dangling off of a bench.  Her head is bowed, her hands clasped in her lap, fingers moving slightly over a simple metal item.  She is clothed in simple brown robes, with only a sash to designate her as an acolyte of Ilmater, the patron diety of suffering and sacrifice.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, staggering with exhaustion, shoves the cart a few feet away from the woman.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Without a word, the woman jumps down from the bench and comes to you.  Her smile is warm, her mere presence is soothing to you, calming you instantly.  She touches Maoulue on the arm, and a warmth spreads from her touch all the way through his body, bringing clarity and peace to the overwhelmed wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue lets out a large breath he didn't realize he was holding.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Silently she turns to the cart.  She peers in and her countenance changes to that of pity.  It's as if this hurt man, his pain, is causing her pain.  She reaches down to touch Douglas, her hands starting to stain red from his blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A yellow-gold glow starts emanating from her hands.  Seconds later, Douglas gasps, his breathing regulates, yet he does not come fully awake.   The glow recedes and she turns back to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He's very weak.  We have no full bedding here, but there are bedrolls inside.  Would you like him to stay here so I can look after him?"  He voice is soft, musical, and... sad.  Yet her smile has not faded an inch, even when she looked on Douglas with pity.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course.  And you both are welcome to stay here with him, if you'd like.  Pardon my not mentioning before.  Ilmater's house is always available."  She bows to you, and starts to attempt to move the man in the cart.  She's about as tall as it, though, so it's proving a bit... awkward.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With the Frenchman's help, Douglas is brought inside and ministered to by the small woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's eyelids begin to close against his will. Only when he sees his man laid down do they finally shut, casting his mind into an unsettled darkness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Cut to Culver's</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, seeing his companion trod off toward the tavern, slowly closes the door and turns to the bound man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He kicks him roughly in the ribs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood spurts out of the man's mouth as he comes back to a hazy consciousness.  Looking around through swollen eyes, he sees Dieter and starts to laugh.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Wracking, hacking coughs cut in, followed by more laughing.  He picks his head up and looks around.  He seems to recognize the place, even by the darkened interior, and starts guffawing, hacking, laughing, retching.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When he calms down, breathing heavy, he whispers something Dieter doesn't catch.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, raises an eyebrow at the man’s show of resistance. He leaves the man probe for a moment and searches the disheveled room for another spare bit of rope or any kind of cord.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks around for rope and finds three different types.  With this being partly a fishing shop, there are many styles and lengths of fishing lines.  There are hempen ropes as in the style dungeoneers carry.  Lastly, there is a nasty bit of barbed rope.  Looks a bit like twine spliced with brambles every few inches.  Used typically to keep rodents away from produce.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter snorts in sadistic amusement as he grabs a length of hempen rope and pulls an end of it through the man’s bindings and ties it off securely. He then throws the other end over the hanging light fixture and tests it for load bearing by tugging on the loose end.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is about to hang it up, then realizes there is no way this thing is going to hold the man's weight.  It's about to come out of the ceiling bolting at any time.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He frowns slightly and looks instead for a joist to hurl it over instead.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The entire place is trashed.  If you took some time, you could make something.  You might be able to use magic.  Looks like there is a door to the back room, you might be able to use that, too.  The room just isn't yielding much in the way of what you need.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter growls in frustration, pulls the rope back and drags the man toward the back room</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He opens the door and inspects the surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This room was mainly used for business.  There's a desk that's been overturned on the far side, an window broken beyond it.  Parchment and papers are strewn all around, crunching under foot.  A large old wardrobe is in the corner, very thick, looks to be made of solid oak.  There also is a now tattered rug on the ground, but it looks to have been of a good quality when it was hale.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter lays down the rope for now, rights the desk and inspects the wardrobe.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man has stopped laughing at this point.  He bangs his head on the floor every now and again, though.  The desk produces nothing of interest, it's been ransacked well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first thing you notice about the wardrobe is, when you swing the doors wide, at the top of the doors, a two pronged hook is fashioned at the top.  You assume this for heavy pelts or coats used in the winter.  (Investigation for more.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There're some winter clothes in the wardrobe, heavy furs and such, all off their hangers and in a pile on the bottom.  A purple piece of cloth is hanging from a crossbow bolt in the middle of the back wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the cloth and bolt.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are runes, arranged in a circle.  Blood stains parts of the cloth.  The man on the floor starts laughing again.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls the bolt free and grabs the cloth. He turns around and drives the bolt into the man’s upper leg.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A scream of pain, the man's head thrashes side to side.  A stream of expletives issue forth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A beat or two more, he picks his head up to look at you.  He looks Dieter dead in the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I know you, your whole crew, are dead men.  Dead.  Men."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hoists the man into the closet and hooks his bindings onto the hook. He closes the door in the man’s face and throws the net of invisibility over the wardrobe. He glances again at the rune cloth and tucks it into his pocket before hastening out to the front door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The man was shouting as you were trussing him up.  When the net of invisibility went over him, not only did the entire wardrobe vanish, his shouts cut off as he was never there.  There were portions of the bottom that weren't covered by the net, but with the craziness of the room, it's hard to tell until the room is cleared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter heads out the front door, he sees Frenchy coming toward him.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy recounts what has transpired.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks to the stars.  He feels the weight of the day, aches start to reach into his muscles.  He is weary, emotionally and physically.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s eyes, dark already, go completely black at these tidings. He starts walking toward the inn, then stumbles slightly. He leans an arm on Frenchy as they walk back toward the inn.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They stumble back into the room, exhausted. Dieter lays down almost immediately.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He immediately passes out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dreams of the adventurers are heavy, thick, like swimming through molasses.  Vague dangers are felt through layers of viscous fluid; words are muffled, faces are blurred.  All three, however, share an aspect of their dreams...  A ring of runes, moving in a circle.  Spelling out something ominous.  The laughing man from the scry can be heard every time the runes come.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Overall, though, the three spend a night in restful sleep. (Long rest and level up!)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter is awoken by the crowing of roosters thoroughout the town. His eyes remain shut for awhile as his dream consciousness lingers on the runic circles and laughing voice. He opens his eyes slowly, and looks at the scene around him. Empty is the space where when he last laid eyes, there had been four thuggish mercenaries settling down for the night. He wondered if their...did they even have (spirits?)...if they lay there dreaming of a morning full of silver riches. He wondered about Frenchy. He reaches for the mirror just to touch something that had been part of the summoning, but refrained from looking. Some other time. He looks about the room checking over the supplies that had been strewn from the mine cart by the henchmen and setting them in order on Maouelue’s empty bed. Where was Maouelue? Frenchy...he had said something about the parsonage. “I should make my way there straight forth”, he thought. Reminded of his friends, he draws forth the runed cloth in his pocket, pondering the similarity of those in his dream. He stands there for a moment transfixed. Then, with a backward glance at the pile of silver and tools, heads out and locks the door behind him. He makes haste for the parsonage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter walks through town to the parsonage, after inquiring directions with Denson.  The streets are sparse but the people that see you wave in happy greeting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On approach, Dieter almost does a double take at the hovel that Denson directed him too.  In the light of day, it's barely more than some warped boards fit together, possibly not even nailed down.  A basic bench is outside; a small woman sits, lips moving in quiet prayer.  There is no door to the building.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She nods in welcome, says, "Well met, traveler.  I do have new of your companions.  Come with me."  She hops down off the bench, waves you in as she enters the hovel.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It is a small space, you see some makeshift windows on the left and right wall.  Against the back is a small table with various items adorning it.  There are bedrolls stacked in a corner.  Against the right wall, huddled in bedrolls, are Maouelue and Douglas.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard's mouth is agape, nearly snoring.  Douglas is laying on his back, red-splotched bandages on covering his midsection.  His tunic was hastily bundled under his head as a makeshift pillow.  His breathing is regular.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your wizard friend is fine, just over tired.  The other man was deeply cut, possibly through to organs, there was quite a bit of damage.  The knife was serrated, as well.  He did not have a very good night's sleep, but I did what I could.  He's stable, breathing, and taking the healing I can give, so that's a positive.  If I can get liquids into him throughout the day, he should bounce back quicker."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I would like to go and see about more bandages and some cleaning solution for the wound, would you like to stay while the awake?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Recollections of last night's drunken escalation flash through Dieter's mind and he feels a deep pang of guilt and sorrow as he looks down on the victims of his rashness.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He bends down, taking a closer look at Douglas, then with a steely exhale, he touches Maouelue's shoulder.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's eyes open groggily, and a thin smile widens on his face.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They turn to look at Douglas</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both let out a long “Wheeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter appears lost in thought. He idly produces a flame and unconsciously rotates through the rune shapes that have haunted his recent waking and dreaming hours.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue stirs as he sees the symbols...His eyes glass over slightly and he involuntarily begins to trace the runes with an incredibly thin ray of frost.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The fire and ice begin to create a waving mist around the runes which begins to distort the air as a mirage in the desert.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two journeymen lock eyes in a trance-like gaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The trance leads down psychic bends, twists, turns.  Visions mentally fly by the two, trying to come together in some semblance of understanding.  Both are  trying, straining to make sense of their shared dreams.  Suddenly, the trance breaks...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And they see a piece of parchment next to Douglas is on fire.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter also feels a sudden heat in his chest pocket.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sees Dieter wince and looks down at his coat pocket. He reaches out with his icy hands and attempts to free the now-glowing rune cloth.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue extracts the cloth and sees that it is somewhat waxen, so it's not completely up in flames.  However, it is hot to the touch and in need of the cooling touch of the wizard. </p><p></p><p>The runes stand out on the cloth a yellow-gold, almost searingly bright.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter attempts to snuff out the flaming parchment with a few drops of water from his skin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flame goes out, but the parchment is scorched beyond recognition.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks for any nearby container he might use to contain the pieces of the charred sheet.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The table holds some odd knickknacks.  A handknife, a pearl of decent size, a couple coppers, and a strange necklace.  The necklace has a burnished and rust-scarred pendant that lies open.  The pendant is ovoid and hollow on the inside, it looks as if it could carry ashes or something of the like.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is preoccupied at the moment, but the wizard is very perceptive this morning.  He hears screaming coming from the farther down street, from the heart of the village.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves quickly to the door, opens it, and peers down the lane seeking the source of the scream.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Maouelue peeks out from the doorway, there are several people running toward the center of town.  Some folks are bringing buckets of water, some two at a time, running towards what Maouelue can see is smoke billowing from somewhere down the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a cursory glance back at his preoccupied friend, he exits and closes the door behind him, then runs full speed down the street directly toward the smoke.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few steps outside the parsonage, a very beautiful young woman locks eyes with you as she's running towards your end of town.  She makes a beeline for the wizard.  As she gets closer, she says, "Are you Maouelue, the man with Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"My name is Kirra, I'm Denson's daughter.  He sent me to find you.  There's been an accident in your room.  We need you or your friend's help, please!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hastens his pace and joins the maiden.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes!  Please come, quickly!"  She takes off toward The Sleeping Sheep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue follows apace.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both come around the corner, bumping into more people as the crowd from the other night seems to have just shifted buildings.  This morning, however, no one is in a jovial mood.  They're running a bucket brigade to put out a fire emanating from the side of the Sleeping Sheep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue, the budding frost mage, shouts for the crowd to stand aside and immediately begins to channel a ray of frost at the blaze, attempting to contain the outer edges of the fire to prevent the spread.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares intently at the locket, caught between a strange desire to enclose the ashes within the trinket, and a fear of transgression against their healer host.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He reaches out and turns it over idly in his hands.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>We can roll it in beyond or roll20 if you want</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>1d20 = 16 + 6 (wis) + 1 (ring) = 23</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter rolls a Wisdom save! (23)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Avrae's back up!)</p><p>Dieter, for a second, feels a psychic pull on his will.  Before he can really comprehend what's happening, the feeling completely fades and he's left staring at the locket, hand outstretched towards it.  You don't quite remember setting it down...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The beam of ice travels into the burning building, spreading it's calming cold to the searing flames.  Although it seems to die down a bit, the flames are still going.  A cheer goes up, and the brigade resumes tossing heaps of water.  Looks like they might have it quenched in a few minutes... or possibly with another spell?</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A blue light begins emitting from the wizard's hands.  A yell goes up, the crowd disburses back to give you room.  A flash, then a rime of ice layers and crawls its way through the room, completely quenching the rest of the fire...  All save a pile of coins, which look to be glowing red hot in the middle of a puddle of water.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue heads into the smouldering wreckage and beckons Kirra to follow.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Denson meets both you and Kirra as you enter the burned out section of the Sheep.  </p><p>"I'm sorry about this, Master Wizard.  I was hoping to catch you myself, but the fire hastened faster than I thought it would.  Had to organize the brigade as soon as I could."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He shakes his head.  "Looks like a good deal of damage.  Was there anything expensive left in your rooms, goodsir?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, I'm glad of that, too.  I have to be off, need to talk with the town elders, see about repairing the damage as soon as we can.  Please let Kirra know if you need anything, or happen to find out what caused it all."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"It would seem that our presence here hath brought some form of wealth through our efforts out at the mine..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"However, it is also clear that, whether it was here prior or not, we have also drawn out foul actors and in turn share some responsibility for the fate of the town and its people..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"With good faith, I would use this silver to settle our debts and grievances with the good merchants and proprietors and do one better..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We met a young boy in the street yesterday...He said to us, <i>We take care of our own here, m'lord.</i>..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I would like to bind our services to the protection of the town and form a guild of minutemen to both secure the town and patrol the surrounding lands, mines, and resources..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I fear the darkness that grows in the mountains and forests, and would use my every power to prevent its spread."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Pray, relay this to the elders, for we must not delay if we are to follow Culver's fate to the heart of this darkness."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at you, stunned.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Ah...  Aye, aye goodman Wizard.  I'll be sure to relay your interests to the Council.  They would be very happy to hear of your interest to protect the town."  He bows low to you.  "Mell met, kind sir.  Kirra, please let me know if these men need anything."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And with that, he turns and hastens away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The milling crowd lets out a tired but heartening, "Huzzah," and quickly goes back to their respective daily grinds.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Kirra says to Maouelue, "You have quite a way with words, Master Wizard.  And we very much appreciate what you've said you'll do for the town.  If you pardon my asking, why do you think an evil has beset Oakhurst?  We're not much to speak of."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh...  My, okay.  Let me see..."  She steps gingerly into the wreckage of your former room, taking care not to step on anything smoking or water-logged.  She squats on her haunches when she gets near to the pile of now dimly glowing coins.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There's something written on these.  On all of them. But I... I can't quite...  No.  I can't make it out at all.  Looks to be some other language.  Are these your coins?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue summons a fey arctic fox, takes out a book, pen, and ink from his backpack, then quickly scrawls a message relaying these events to Dieter, bidding him to join them in the drawing room of The Sleeping Sheep as soon as possible. He tears the page out and quickly rolls it up, then places it in the fox's trap. He then touches a glowing blue spot in the middle of its forehead with his thumb and forefinger, telepathically directing the fey creature to bring this at once to Dieter at the parsonage of Ilmater.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sits in ritual to produce a fox companion.  As he does so, Kirra searches The Sheep as well as surrounding shops for a metal container for the coins.  She comes back to the wizard disheartened and empty handed.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I could find no metal box that would work for what you want.  There is a metal coffer Kentham owns, it is too small for this amount, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He scribbles on another page “...bring your net...” and tucks it inside the other message roll, then sends the fox hence.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The wizard begins to gather a load of the other materials and meets Kirra’s eye in search of direction to the room of her choice.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh...  Um... Through here.  You can use our gathering room."  She leads you to a larger room guests use as a dining hall.  It's a decent sized common room, with some recessed corner tables you can use to set up shop.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Of course, I would be happy to.  Would you like me to bring you anything before I do?"</p></div>
<div class="character-3"><p>@SuoRess</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The lady bows herself out.  You are alone in the common room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue continues to gather loads of silver and equipment, arranging them in the corner of the room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter stares, still captivated by the locket, then suddenly snaps to his senses. His attention turns to Douglas. He leans over and attempts to rouse the wounded warrior.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out one of Trix’s swirling red potions and looks at it curiously. He uncorks the bottle and purses Douglas’ mouth open, then trickles a couple of drops down his throat...hoping...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The liquid is swallowed.  You wait a beat.  And another.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You first see the blood on the bandage recede.  Douglas's eyes flutter.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes Douglas’s head in hand and gasps, “My friend!”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He's not very strong yet, holding his head feels like holding a heavy, unbalanced melon.  His eyes flutter some more, then, slowly, they open.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Dieter?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Douglas! Who did this to you my good man?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks around the room with his eyes, not daring to lift his head yet.</p><p>"I... didn't see his face.  He came outta nowhere.  Put the knife into my gut.  When he pulled it out, I screamed and...  then everything went black.   How long have I been out?  Where are we?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He was still passed out when I sat down against the Pig to rest my eyes."  He breathes heavily.  "Guess that was a pretty bad idea, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter reaches for the rune cloth in his pocket only to recall that it is still in Maouelue’s possession.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What cleric?  Oh, right.  We're in Ilmater's parsonage.  If I could get some water, I think I might be able to try to get up."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter hands him what’s left of his waterskin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He drinks sparingly, making sure he doesn't over do.  Douglas winces as he sits up, but then looks surprised and takes the bandage off.  Underneath is a gash neatly knitting itself back together, the blood receding as if being erased.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Wow! Thank you friend.  Those bottles are better than gold!  So," he says, getting up, "What should we do now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter thinks for a moment, then he remembers he has his mess kit in tow. That should do nicely to gather up the parchment ashes. He dares not leave them behind, so he opens up the tin box and brushes the ashes into the cup before resealing and stowing the box in his pack. He still feels oddly compelled by the amulet, but will not sully the good will of the Ilmater by taking it unbidden. He casts a fleeting glance back at the locket, then says to Douglas,</i></p><p>“Let’s go now and find Maouelue...then break our fast while we consider our next course of action.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas gets up gingerly.  Patting himself down, checking to see his inventory, he frowns.  Then smile abruptly as he fishes out a few coins, drops them on the table.  "Not much, but I hope it'll do.  After you!  Oh, I'll have to stop by my rooms to grab a new tunic, too."  He stoops down to pick up his blood sodden shirt.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They leave the building and begin walking back to the inn as they continue to converse.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, I stay in a barn, southwest of town.  Farmer's real nice.  Since I'm just passing through, I wasn't planning on spending too much money or setting up shop at The Sheep.  I was mainly at the mine most of the time anyways.  If it's all the same to you, I'd like to stick with you guys?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“We welcome your company with open arms...and if I could make a casual observation, you seem to have a part to play in this yet. What do you know about those men?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Which ones?!  There seemed to be thugs every time I turned my head!"  He shrugs, good-naturedly.  "The ones in the lady's mirror, I couldn't tell much.  Only know the moustache man vaguely.  Saw the big man at The Pig last night, he had his goons with him.  I recognize them, but I'm not high up enough on any ladder to know names," he chuckles.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There's a lot of people that work for the big man; some that live in town, some that don't.  Either way, seems like he's working for someone, too.  Could be more than one person, but the talk I've heard is that Moustache is the boss.  Nothing gets done without his okay."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I see...let us take care then not to draw attention to ourselves and our mission...though...I suppose I should avoid free ales for a while...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter lowers his head in a show of mild embarrassment.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah...  I never got one of those last night!  Too busy...," he starts patting his pockets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Dieter, you didn't happen to see..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You didn't happen to see a piece of parchment paper, big spot of ink on it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I can’t say I have, not unless, well...there was a piece next to you on the table, but...it burned. We...there...was this circle of runes...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter trails off as his eyes cloud over slightly and his complexion darkens a shade.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It burned?  Hmm.  Strange.  And the runes, are they like the ones on the coin I showed you?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Coin?...wait...<i>in the mine!</i> I knew I had seen their like...  what do they mean? You mentioned you were searching for them. “</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yeah, that's the reason some of us were there.  Besides the ore veins.  The big man came up to me one night in the Pig, asked me if I had found any of those coins.  Laid down five gold, said, 'There's more where that came from, bring me more of these coins when you find them,' and that was it.  I have no idea what they are or what they mean.  I don't read runes, and I didn't ask the big man.  He's not an 'answering questions' type, anyways, know what I mean?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Indeed...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter frowns gravely</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Dark deeds, runic circles, mystical convergence...we must be wary. Fel things await those who delve too deep into the magical unknowns of this world.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He reflects on something.  "Huh...  I would think those would be the thugs that had Culver, but we saw him with Moustache..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Dieter considers this for a moment, his gaze is drawn to a glimmer of blue-white light streaking toward him from down the lane. As it draws nearer, its form becomes clearer. It appears to be a sort of fey fox. It sprints directly to him and holds its mouth slightly agape. He appears to be offering a small scroll held in his trap.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peers curiously at the beautiful, unearthly creature and slowly reaches for the roll. As he stretches it out, a second piece of paper falls to the ground. He stoops to pick it up and sees the message “...bring your net...”. With a furtive glance over at Douglas, he quickly reads Maouelue’s message on the larger roll. His gaze lingers on the paper for a beat, then he turns to address Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Douglas, ill tidings from Maouelue at The Sleeping Sheep. Pray, hasten to your rooms and gather what you need then rejoin us at the inn.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Will do, meet you there." He dashes away toward his lodgings.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks at a steady pace toward the inn until Douglas is out of view, then he turns and sprints instead to Culver’s shoppe.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he approaches the building, he casts a few furtive glances around, wishing to avoid the watch of any passers by.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter looks around, believing he has been unseen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He enters the building and locks the door behind him. Seeing the scene of destruction again in the morning light kindles his inner rage once more. With a steely grimace, he makes his way to the back room.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he enters, he surveys the scene, he is keen to determine whether anyone has disturbed his...secret.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter scans the scene.  Everything looks the same as you left it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves over to where the armoire had been and reaches out, feeling for the cords of his net.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>... he grips them...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls the net back and folds it up, then straps it on the underside of his pack. He lets out an ice-cold breath through pursed lips, then pulls the wardrobe doors ajar.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wardrobe swings open easily.  The furs are still on the floor of the cabinet.  The man is gone.  On the back wall, just as the previous cloth was hanging by a bolt, you see a piece of parchment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>On it, a large ink dot can be seen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s form wavers for a moment, his shirt seems to stretch as his body swells slightly. He lets out a furious ROAR before shrinking back down to size again. He takes the bolt and parchment down and tucks them in his pack, then looks about the room and wardrobe again searching for any trace left by someone who could have set this man free. Surely the man could not have escaped without aid...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In his rage, he searches through the area, trying to find any semblance of how the man could have left or who could have been sneaky enough to pull of the heist.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A green glow surrounds him as he peers into nooks and crannies, checks for footprints or markings, and tries to piece together the events of the man's escape.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>In a blinding mental flash, Dieter sees a hand drawing the spot on the piece of paper, hands clothed in dark gloves.  You see thin boots, well crafted, Eleven made, stepping lightly over everything, not making any prints.  Whispers of speech come to you, but are immediately hushed.  The speech was common, but the words you cannot hear.  There is a surge of magic as the two beings are together, then they aren't in the area anymore.  You feel as if a magic transportation spell was used.  But the thief didn't use a spell to get in.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter gets closer to the wardrobe, hoping to find anything of use to identify these people.  And his eyes fall on a piece of parchment outside of the wardrobe.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>Supply of ropes, cut to size of five feet each, 10 gold.  Order of barrels, wooden, iron banded, made to order, four foot height by three foot diameter at the middle, 25 gold. Branding iron with the lettering RM, 10 gold.  Order of potions, sleeping draughts, bought through (garbled writing), 150 gold.  Signed, Culver.  Purchaser signature, Veena.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He takes the bill of sale and places it alongside the other parchment in his pack. The small muscles around his eyes pulsate with fury. He then dashes out the door making haste toward the inn.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue has been tirelessly moving the party's possessions into the drawing room. As he secures the last of the silver and heads back to the burned room, he thanks Kirra and excuses her from her vigil. He takes stock of the ornate chest and the pile of rune-embossed coins. He lowers himself to the ground and folds his legs in a lotus pose and begins to meditate on the items' respective markings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a good bit of salvageable materials, surprisingly, in the room.  Along with the heads of several shovels and picks, Maouelue finds a few books intact.  Both packs are remarkably still functional, with all of their belongings in them!  Some furniture is able to be fixed, and Kirra has already set to work on fixing them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the wizard sets to meditating, visions keep intruding, and he's not sure what they mean.  Water in a stream.  A dark basement, smelling of mildew.  Creaking wood.  A funny tasting cookie.  A pretty woman in a dark hooded cloak.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then the ring of runes comes into focus, glowing orange-red in the blackness of his meditation.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another rune pops out at him in recognition.  He can now make out <i>R-NEM-R-</i>.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Delving further and further into the meditation, possibly in frustration that he cannot piece together everything at the moment, he loses the thread and the calm fades.  The visions are chased away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As the wizard comes out of his trance, Dieter appears outside the burned wall, eyes agape at the scene before him. He sees the pile of rune coins and his heart skips a beat. He calls out to Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue picks up his head slowly</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter recounts the details of what he found at Culver’s and tells Maouelue about the teleportation and the bill of sale. He conveniently leaves out his mild torture of the brute.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue appears deeply concerned. He relays his proclamation to Denson about forming a guild.</i></p><p><i>Dieter considers this a moment, a bit taken aback at first, then nods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two men wait for a few, tidying up and reviewing the bits of information they have collectively.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Around midday, Kirra comes in with foodstuffs and drinks.  Douglas follows shortly after, carrying a large pack on his back.  He has procured a shield as well; a solidly built oaken shield with the crest of the town on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Hiya fellas!  What's to eat, I'm starving!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group welcomes Douglas and takes a short rest while they take their luncheon and fill him in on their tidings.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group finishes their rest and gets up from the table.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“I would like to take our silver and this chest over to the Saynea at the forge.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas, still stuffing bacon and biscuits in his pockets for later, says, "Right.  I'm on it," and exits hastily. </p><p>Kirra nods, saying, "He should be back any moment now.  Unless there were other things for the Council to discuss.  They're our elders of the town, and sometimes it takes a bit to get them all together at the same time.  Should be about finished, though, I'd expect."  She smiles at the two of you and continues cleaning the remains of the meal.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gives a cursory nod then turns back to his vittles. Maouelue’s eyes however, linger a while on Kirra as he smiles back, perhaps a bit more broadly than usual.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two adventurers make themselves comfortable while they await the return of their host.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A couple hours later, Maouelue and Dieter start to get a little worried, Denson still isn't back yet.  Minutes later, you hear loud banging from down the hall, towards the rooms.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both jump up at the sound and immediately go to investigate the sound source.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As they approach the damaged section of the building, hammering and sawing sounds grow louder.  The scene displays itself as a group of burly men handling lumber and tools, working at an extremely fast pace in rebuilding the fire-affected room.  Denson is there, directing the work.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Friends!  Looks like we'll have this back up and running in no time, eh?  Glad Kirra was able to assist you gentlemen.  As for the Council," he says, looking around, "let us away to a more secluded spot.  One with less ears, eh?!"   He leads you out of the room and to a locked door past the kitchens.  The room is comfortable for the three, chairs are offered.  Denson pulls a dark brown bottle of something and three glasses. He sets them out on the table, pours a thick amber liquid, and knocks the bottle against them, offering them up.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He swigs his in one, grimaces while he sets the glass back down.  He pours another while he starts talking. </p><p>"There are five elders of the Oakhurst Council.  They are all venerated members of this community; business owners, folks that have lived here their entire lives.  Which says a lot, because we're kind-of known as a transition town.  People come, people go.  Not too man stay, if you catch my drift."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The Five make all of the government-type decisions facing the town.  They also tend to know the scuttlebutt before anyone else.  They keep things close to their collective vests, however.  The rest of us just find a way to...  work within their system.  Don't get me wrong, they are fair, good people.  They take a deep responsibility for this town. Their town.  With that being said, they'd like to meet with you.  Tonight, to be to the point."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I said I would ask you fellows.  There's no pressure, you don't have to meet with them if you'd rather not.  I did pass along your message, Master Wizard.  They are...  intrigued.  No one's really expressed interest, especially at this level.  I believe they want to share with you some information to help you...  To help solidify your choice.  Or not.  Guess it's up to you lads."  He smiles and sips at his drink.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue each take their drinks in one and set them down.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Pardon our haste, but we must not dally. Culver suffers dearly for each passing moment we delay. We have...seen it.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, you've seen Culver?  And he's hurt?  By all means, take what you need.  But, beggin' your pardon...  There was no chest in that room.  I scoured it thoroughly, and I didn't see a chest of any sort.  Nor any minecart.  I think that might have been a casualty, too.  Again, many apologies lads."</p><p>The chest was made of thick wood with iron bands.  The minecart was made of wooden walls with metal bracing on the bottom and metal wheel parts.  Maouelue found a good amount of metal left after the fire.  No iron bands or wheel bits, though.  The silver ore was strewn over the floor and the coins were in a pile in a puddle of water.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye!  Safe travels.  Oh, and be wary of the Muhlen sisters.  They can be... trying."  He smiles and ushers you out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As they open the door to leave, they see Douglas coming down the road with the cart and they proceed with the loading of all their possessions. As they do, they ask Denson if they can pay him some silver for his troubles.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Many thanks, gentlemen."  He bows to you both.  "Anything I can do to help, please let me know."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group, eager to get on their way, pushes the cart quickly to the forge and seek Saynea to check on the status of their custom orders.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party makes their way to the smithee, minecart in tow.  The same steady hammering can be heard as before, however it has more pronounced notes.  Saynea is smoothing out some bits of Dieter's sword edge, forming the bevels and tempering it.  She looks up as the group comes in, and she smiles.</p><p>"Hoy there!  Glad you could stop by today!  Got some things to show you."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She takes the large silver spheres out, shows them to Maouelue for his inspection.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes them in hand and looks over the smooth silver orbs.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows her head. "Thank you kindly!  Here is the mold, as promised.  Any time you need more, come on back in."</p><p>"And for you," she says to Dieter, "I'm almost finished with the sword end."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The totem will take a couple more days."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"If you'd like, leave your staff and I can finish it and affix it in a couple more hours?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She slowly nods, "Sure, and thank you for the trust.  I'll put this in the back room for safety."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group load out the rune coins and pack enough silver to be wise for the road. About 25 nuggets each.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles, "I'll be here when you get back."  She twirls her hammer and starts back to working on your sword attachment.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>With a nod, they move off down the road. Dieter, in a hushed voice, suggests that they head back to Trix. He tells them he would like to have her scry again using these strange parchments and coins as a focus.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s face begins to elongate strangely and his body begins to bend at the midriff, his proportions oddly shifting as his clothing and gear merge into his shifting skin. A moment later where he had stood, there is now a large black stallion. Who neighs and beckons Douglas and Maouelue towards his back in an apparent bid to get them to mount.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas takes a step back, eyes wide, stammering.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I knew you had magic, but..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye."  He'll go to pat Dieter Stallion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Never."  Standing in awe, he thinks for a moment, then says, "Are we really going back to the forest right now?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter Stallion lets out a snort and kicks his hind hooves at the dirt.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas looks from the horse to the wizard, then back again.  "No, yeah.  Yeah, that's okay.  We can go, that's...  Yeah, that's okay.  Let's go!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gives him what he thinks is an understanding look.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They both hop on, Douglas a bit gingerly and requiring a hand up, then Dieter Stallion accelerates to a canter and heads out of town towards the forest.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you head out of town, farmers wave and double take at the stallion.  You pass the animals in the field again.  There are even a few farm-hands out this time.  As you get closer to the forest route, Dieter, having been through the trail before, picks up the track fairly easily.  There are a couple twists, but he remembers to look for the blood on the trees, and the arrows pointing the way.   A short time later, the group comes into view of the ramshackle homestead of Bellatrix.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just as Douglas hops down from the druid, and arrow flies by his head, narrowly missing piercing his skull.  It embeds itself in the tree just beyond him, and a rapid series of sticks breaking can be heard from where you all just passed by.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone whirls their heads around, looking for the source of the shot.</p><p>(Perception checks!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas and Dieter can't see anything through the underbrush and the trees.  But Maouelue detects the slightest hint of movement approximately 70 feet away.  Something humanoid is crouching down behind a tree staying perfectly still and blending into the foliage nearly seamlessly.  Nearly...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two riders dismount and seek the nearest cover searching for a tree or perhaps behind a wall of the shack.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s form begins to quickly revert, and just as he is back in human form, he shouts,</i> “Earth gods, hear my words”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An arrow wings through the trees again, this time just catching Douglas in the shoulder.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter moves to the opposite side of the lane from Maouelue and also tries to obscure himself behind a tree.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas falls to a knee and rips the arrow from his arm.  He looks around for cover, decides to dash for the homestead.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The being bedecked in dark leather armor is more visible now.  A scarf or some type of headgear is obscuring their face.  They make to raise the bow again, but in one swift motion, spins on their heels, stows the bow, and <i>runs</i> away from the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Douglas runs towards the shack, he sees a shimmer of air through the doorway.  Bellatrix appears a bit further beyond where Douglas just came from and casts...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And from the underbrush, thorny vines reach up 20 feet all around the escaping being.  It tries to make a jump over the rising vines, only to be thrust back into a circling hedge of bramble thickets.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue dashes 70ft toward the bound assassin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter moves into range and makes a long range sling attack with his second magic stone.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas is going to run the way he came, ending up next to Trix.  He unslings his shortbow, knocks an arrow, and fires.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow sticks into the increasingly dense rising thicket.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With all of the tumult around the being, it calms itself and looks around...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It ties a length of rope around an arrow and lets fly at the closest tree.  The arrow sticks, the humanoid scrambles up the length of rope. (It's now 10 feet above the thorn wall and 30 feet from the canopy of the trees.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Damn," swears Bellatrix.  She reaches into her component pouch, brings out a dried snakes skin and cast...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A green beam of light streaks toward the dangling thing, hitting it and swaying the cord.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ambusher slips down 10 feet, scrabbling to hang on at the last moment.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Douglas gasps as he sees the fire catching quickly.  He looks at Bellatrix.  Her face is horror-stricken, eyes wide.  Douglas runs to the thicket, taking a pot-shot above.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The shot goes wide, but he knew that before he shot.  He slings the bow while he's running and makes for the thorn wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finding it increasingly difficult, what with the immediate frostbite and the opposing growing heat beneath, the humanoid tries to scramble up the rope with all their ability...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Climbing 60 feet straight up, tongues of flame just beginning to lick at their boot heels, they pull themselves with extreme dexterity up to the higher branches of the tree.</p><p>(They are in 3/4 cover now, which means they get +5 to AC and Dex throws.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix screams in horror, running at the burning thicket...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The flames have just started to catch in the underbrush, the once hale leaves in the trees around the thicket-wall searing and adding to the potential for this to become a problem. (The wall was 20ft in diameter, and it was mostly made of dead or dying branches, because of who cast it.  The floor of the forest is covered in moss, dead leaves, lichen, and the like.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>There is also some clambering happening, you sense movement, but can't tell in which direction.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix, still concentrating on the black void, releases and with a rush of wind the black void drops away, leaving the signed and smoking remains of the forest.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow careens off.  Douglas swears.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You all hear the bounding through the trees stop.  Another two arrows come down at Douglas!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first arrow hits just in front of the tired man, but the second...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It slices through his shield, finding a soft spot in the old wood.  The arrowhead just pierces Dougals's skin, but that's enough for the poison to do it's worst.  Just above the heart, the poison enters his bloodstream.  Green foam flecks his mouth, then starts pouring out, and he falls to the ground.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She sees boiling green foam pouring from his mouth still, she can't find breath or a pulse.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She closes her eyes and casts..</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>She has a plethora of fun things.  Two shortswords of poisoning.  A light crossbow.  A elven made cloak (Arcana check, or attune to it for specs.)  Her headscarf also gives her advantage on stealth checks.  There are plenty of bolts, none are poisoned yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't really tell what exactly it does, but it does track as magical.  She also has a bandolier about her torso, filled with about fifteen different vials.  All of them are various poisons.  (Intelligence check to see what they might be.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>"This...  This is Veena Muhlen.  She's one of the Five.  She owns the general store with her sister, Hozieh."  She looks shocked, horrified.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The vines come out very quickly, surprising the woman on the ground and securing her completely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A beat later, she starts laughing hoarsely.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You say craven, I say... business.  This is nothing from the Council.  We're very much looking to speak with you both later."  Her eyes are still closed, but she is smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Check your pocket before you spit your venom, or repeat my words back to me."  Eyes still shut, still smiling.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, without letting his eyes leave Veena, pulls out the ink splotched parchment from his pocket.</i></p><p>“You mean this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She opens an eye.  Then both.  Smiles back at you, then winks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Have something in your eye? Just <i>what</i> about this carnage and evil is quite so funny to you?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The fact that you think you can get information from me.  The fact that, even though you're holding that, you have no idea what it means.  The fact that I got caught by amateurs and you didn't kill me outright.  There's <i>plenty</i> to find humorous."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh the latter can be arranged wench...”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter pulls out his scimitar and holds it to her throat.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix cries out, "No, you musn't!  There are horrible consequences if she loses her life by either of you now."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She hestiates.  "I might have an alternate option."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix looks shocked at the accusation.  Then visibly composes herself, although with an effort.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I'm used to having people distrust me. I understand.  What oath could I give you that you could trust?  I've already helped you with potions.  I could swear something in magic, if you would like?  If either of you are able to do something to that effect?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He hands her the parchment and a runed coin.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue regards the scent with intense apprehension and caution, searching for any tell of deceit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix takes the items, looking forlornly at Dieter.  "I will help you in this.  We need to finish with Veena, first.  After we decide on what to do with her, we can make time for another scry.  I will only be able to do one more today.  May I ask, are these yours or no?"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Faintly, in Maouelue's mind, he hears, <i>"There is much to magic.  Life and death are inexorably linked.  I appreciate them both equally."</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue involuntarily mutters under his breath, “Yes...balance in all things...equal measure...a perfect node of truth in between...”</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter proceeds to search her for any boot daggers or hidden vials and the like.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No boot daggers (that would have been cool, though!  C'mon Joe, write a better villain...), the bandolier is off of her, along with all of her equipment.  Didn't get her leather armor off, though.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter scowls.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Bind her while we regain our strength. I will take her to the council myself. I would have you come with us...so willing.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh... I...  can.  If you prefer."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Yes. I will risk no more surprise. Maouelue, come, let us recover an hour and consider what we have seen.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will pack some things.  However, I do travel light.  Let me step inside.  We require Douglas to remain... uninterred, correct?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"He will be sealed inside the thorn wall, but the carrion birds...  They will have access.  If we hurry, it should be fine.  I will make haste."   She picks up her skirts and runs to her home.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix returns with a small pack, using a staff to guide her steps.  The staff is gnarled, twisted, the top is a mess of brambles, nettles, and thorns curving in on itself to form an imperfect spheroid.  "All set.  I've set wards on my home.  Give me a moment to do the same for Douglas's resting place, and I will create the Forcecage for Veena.  Then we will away."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She waves her hands toward the wall of thorns, a shimmering like a heat haze settles on the structure.  Next she turns to Veena.  Her irises turn a milky white, she points her fingers at the woman.  A darkly wavering set of ethereal walls appear around the prone woman, her vine bonds drop away.  She stands and puts out a tentative hand to the dark magic wall.  She recoils as if bitten and looks darkly at the other woman.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"She will not be able to leave."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party takes a short rest while Bellatrix prepares her spells and seem to understand a lot more about their lives thereafter. Though still a bit tired, they carry on with their mission.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party makes haste through the forest and into Oakhurst.  Bellatrix says, "Although I know the way to certain people in the Five, I would be... unwelcome calling upon them.  Do you know who you would like to speak with first?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He scowls at Veena.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Did you take Veena with the group, or is she back at Trix's?)</p><p>"Yes, and no.  There is no head of the Five, they're all equally powerful, within the town as well as in the group.  There is Bazad Dunnol, the tanner.  Rhahlad Boste, he owns the coster.  Vam Stuniz is a wonderful horse trainer, he also works with a variety of farm animals, he's fairly popular with the citizenry.  Then there's Hozieh and Veena."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Yes, I can take you there."  (If you'd rather not rp the blacksmith trip, we can just say you went there & picked up the bit.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group is anxious as they approach the ranch, looking around and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of all the animals.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter seems as calm as he has in a while in the midst of the beast party.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue looks as if he is bracing for a snowstorm.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The quartet walk down the street,  the woman in the cage draws almost all of the attention.  Whispers flit back and forth between shop patrons and the rabble that roam through town.  There aren't a lot of people, but you feel that it probably doesn't matter, this is going to be the hot gossip today.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>After a quick stop by the blacksmith's shop to procure Dieter's staff attachment (which is a beautiful counterpoint to the sliver death accompanying the opposite side of the staff now), the group heads Southeast, to a substantial group of farmland.  Rows of crops sway in the autumnal breeze as farm hands work with various animals.  An interesting addition, A group of rothe' roam the pasture past the waving grain.   These buffalo-type creatures typically come from the north, and it takes a practiced hand to raise them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the group plods deeper into the farm, you see a very dark-skinned man, wide brimmed hat in his hands, talking to a rothe', soothingly.  The man has curly white hair, balding a bit on the top.  Smile lines crease his face, and it's no surprise, he's grinning while talking to the large creature next to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He turns to notice the four people traveling towards him, smiles wider, and makes his way to you after patting the beast on it's rump.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I was wondering when I would have a chance to run into you folks," he says, winning smile possibly going even wider.  "Heard a lot about what you've done for the town already, and what you're planning on doing. Might fine, migh-ty fine.  This little place's been waiting for men like you, been saying it for years, isn't that right Bellatrix?  It's right nice to see you as well, ma'am."  And he gives a little bow.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Please, please, call me Vam.  No one calls me anything but, I won't let 'em!"  He laughs heartily.  "Now, what can I do for the Heroes of Oakhurst, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His smile falters, fades.  </p><p>"Wait, what did you say?"</p><p>He tries to see past you to the cage.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Seeing Veena, he's shocked.  He looks between the four of you, trying to understand what he's seeing.</p><p>"I don't understand.  She killed someone?  When did this happen?  How?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party informs Vam of the events in the forest, withholding that they carry her possessions for now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They also conveniently leave out the part about nearly setting the forest ablaze.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks sternly at the group.  "Well, I have to admit...  Not too sure what to make of all this.  I have quite a bit of history, professionally, with this woman, as most of the town does.  This sounds just like one of them fairy tales, I just can't believe Veena could be capable...  Have you told anyone else?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue fidgets idly with his triumvirate of sliver orbs while the converse.</i></p><p><i>Dieter idly thumbs the contours of his newly-crafted eagle totem.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"A-yuh, that sounds about right, we need to convene immediately."  He dons his hat.  "Lemme check on some things at the house, I'll put a word out to everyone to meet.  There is a building we use as the Council meeting area, but I'm afraid it's not available at the moment.  We'll just have to have them come here, does that work for y'all?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group nods in assent. Everyone is nervous, but this seems an amicable accord thus far. Eyes remain open, but guard is lowered ever slightly.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, one more thing," he says, tightening his gaze on the Maouelue, Dieter, and Bellatrix.  "This Douglas.  You, uh...  You still have the body?  Because if you do, I'd say we might want to bring him here, post-haste."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue glances at Bellatrix.</i></p><p>"We...had not time to intern it, but we have tried to secure it best we could. It's back at Trix's. Might should we head there together once the council is joined?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Tell you what," he turns and whistles at a nearby farm hand on a horse.  "One of you can go with Heston here and retrieve the body.  We might start without you, but no one is going to do anything without seeing Douglas's body."  With that, he makes a clicking sound with his cheek, nods to you all, and runs into the farmhouse at  good pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter obliges and makes great haste as he reassures Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you enter the farmhouse, there are a couple older boys receiving orders from Vam.  </p><p>"Go round them up and bring them back here, double time.  Git going."</p><p>The boys dash out the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue's fiddling becomes more intense as they wait. Creeping cryogenic crystals begin to form on the orbs' surfaces, stretching out from frosty fingertips.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam doesn't see.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue gazes around the farmhouse, taking in his surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A handful of minutes pass.  A knock comes at the door and an older man with broad shoulders and a bald head peeks in.  His hands are large, gnarly, he's still wearing a smock of slick leather.  His face is lined, worn.  He looks extremely worried and says, "Vam, what's all this about needing to meet right away?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue sizes the man up with a glance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue sees a very nicely kept homestead.  Plain wood beams and walls cover the interior, sawdust is on the floor.  Everything looks worn but very naturally so.  There are saddles hung over a bannister that leads to a cellar, it seems.  There is a second floor as well.  The main floor of the house is one big room, encompassing kitchen, sitting room, dining area, and foyer all in one.  There is a small hallway off to the right of the wizard, which ends with a couple doors, one on either side of the hall.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks capable of handling himself in a fight, he's burly, strong.  He exudes an air of timidity, though.  Other than that, Maouelue doesn't get a real solid vibe about him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks tentatively from Vam to you, very timid, very nearly backs out of the doorway.  Vam waves the big man in, and he stops his retreat.  He says, "Mm...  My name is Bazad.  I'm here for the Council meeting."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He nods, shakes your hand rather quickly, then goes over to speak with Vam.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue casts a glance at Bellatrix and takes note of the increasing awkwardness of Veena's caged form.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He moves semi-casually to obscure it from immediate view.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Another knock on the door.  A portly, middle-aged man comes in while he's knocking.  He wears a sense of importance like a cloak.  You get the sense he might have been muscular at one time, but he's let that go for quite a while.  </p><p></p><p>He strides in, making eye contact with Vam and Bazad, then says loudly, "Who in the hell called this meeting.  I know Vam couldn't have been this idiotic, so who's responsible for taking me away from my business?  And at closing time, nonetheless?"  His eyes fall on the wizard and the witch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A realization hits Maouelue as a mental flash...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Veena has not moved or blinked since she's been caged.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What the hell does that mean?!"  He looks around from person to person, arms flailing in the air.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Fear not her cage. She has been placed in stasis in order that we might secure her from flight."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"And I beg your pardon sir, I go by the name of Maouelue. My partner Dieter has gone with some of Vam's hands to retrieve...our friend's body."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"What?..."  The portly man stares incredulously at you.  He and Bazad come over to the cage, with Vam behind.  They are awestruck at their unblinking friend behind bars of energy.</p><p>"I don't understand, what in the hell is going on here?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam explains to the group what the three heroes told to him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He ends and a small voice comes through the doorway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"That's a lie.  My sister would do no such thing."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue turns, startled.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And through the doorway steps a matronly looking woman.  Her clothes give off an air of being of money, old money, but maybe not much is left anymore.  She saunters in, glides.  If you though the other man had an air of importance, it's nothing compared to Hozieh Muhlen.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He gestures grandly at Veena-in-cage.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Red satin, deep crimson velvet, and black lace adorn the petite body, and make a strange non-cohesion to her heavily made-up face.  As if they're fighting each other for relevance, the two styles are at war with your senses.  She comes across as old but trying to be young, but also young trying to pass as courtly and on-in-years.  It is a very odd feeling, and for those not used to her presence, Hozieh Muhlen makes people feel... strange.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She very stately strides over to the cage, aware that all eyes are on her.  As she approaches the Forcecage, she holds her hand out.  Bellatrix starts to warn her, Hozieh's eyes dart to the witch and Bellatrix goes still, silent.  All watch as the sisters reach for each other.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Thunder crashes in the distance, and a streak of white hot light flashes, searing everyone's eyes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue blinks rapidly bidding his vision to return as quickly as possible. He searches about with the butt of his staff trying to reestablish his surroundings.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two women...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And the two women...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Are no longer there.</p><p>Everyone looks around in astonishment.  No one more so than Bellatrix, who is still holding the Forcecage solid.  There are no rips or tears, she is frantically searching for what went wrong.</p><p>Just then, a horse neighs out front, Heston and Dieter enter the house carrying the wrapped body of Douglas.</p><p>Heston asks Vam, "Pardon, boss.  Where do you want us to put this?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He fills Dieter in on what he missed, then turns to address the crowd.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What does the council make of this sorcery?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are dumbfounded, looking on the cage with astonishment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is still moving frantically over the cage, trying to find out what went wrong.  She starts emitting a low whining moan, which picks up the more frantic she gets.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Nothing!" she screams.  "Nothing can break free from a Forcecage!  That is one of my most powerful spells..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the Five go to inspect the body.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter peers into the eyes of each of the remaining council members imploring them to speak up should they have any knowledge of the sisters' intentions.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They are uncomfortable, Bazad looks as if he'd like to find a reason to leave.  They start inspecting the body of Douglas.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't really tell if they're hiding anything or not.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls out the bandolier of poison vials and gestures to Douglas' corpse.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How many more honest townsfolk need to die to serve the ends of this pestilent sorcery!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Will you join us in our aim to consolidate the strength of this town? Will you assent to a guild of vigilant watchers? Would you see this evil undone!?!?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look abashed, Bazad hangs his head.  Vam stands, saying, "A lot of things just happened right now.  I don't doubt that you have the best interests at heart, and we truly appreciate what you've done here."  He takes a deep breath.  "It seems to me that there is some treachery that has been happening right under our noses."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The portly man starts to object, but Vam speaks up, "Now, listen Rhal, you know as well as I do there have been some strange happenings for a good time now.  Matter of fact, the <i>supposed</i> culprit is standing right here in this room.  I'm not saying all of the facts are on the table, but there's enough for me to say this whole town, and <i>especially</i> the Council, needs to make a formal apology to Ms. Bellatrix here."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix's body sags as she releases her Forcecage.  She looks tired, haggard even.  She also looks extremely scared.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two heroes nod in approval of this sentiment, having been aided by Bellatrix without question several times now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You can feel free to rest and eat here.  Don't have much, or anything fancy, but there's plenty of beans and bread, at least tonight.  And there's a room at the end of the hall with space for some bedrolls.  What else for food...  there's the inn, and, of course, The Pig and Falcon.  I have to take care of this body, fellas.  We'll make sure he has a proper burial after we've gone over it for evidence.  Bellatrix, could you assist us, please dear?"</p><p>Vam goes over to check on the witch, and gently leads her over to Douglas.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue and Dieter come over and watch make a strange F-shaped gesture to pay their last respects to Douglas.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The men comb over the body, checking the wounds and the poison stains around his mouth.  They get a very detailed description of the fight with the assassin from Bellatrix.  Ultimately, move the body into the yard and Bellatrix goes about preparing Douglas for burial.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad approaches the two adventurers.  "You gentlemen decided where to sup, yet?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"True, there is much to discuss."  He leads you both to the dining area, where a sturdy table with six seats are stands empty.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue sit down</i></p><p>“We would hear the wisdom of the council. Ere we lay our course. What make you all of this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad makes a showing of offering you seats, then sits after you, playing a gracious host.</p><p>"Well, to be sure, today was one hell of a day.  I'm still not sure I'm not dreaming or not!"  He guffaws, looking around at the others.  Seeing no one is in a jovial mood, his demeanor darkens a bit.  </p><p>He then says, "Listen, there's bad business done here today.  To you, to the townfolks of Oakhurst.  To that young woman out there tending to your friend.  That happened some time ago, actually."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It all starts with missing children in the town.  A whole mess of them went missing, and we just couldn't find out what was happening to them.  When we sent out for help to other towns around the area, they reported the same thing happening.  Obviously, the Council got to work speaking with everyone, sometimes seven or eight times.  I feel we did our due diligence.  And, no matter who we talked to, the finger always pointed at Trix, there."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"She was always the black sheep of the community.  Everyone knew she practices magic.  At one time, our little town was very anti magic.  There was an impassioned plea from Trix's family, and we started turning our minds around, slowly to be sure.  Then someone showed us the black art that she deals in, and, well, one thing lead to another.  She was run out of town.  I do believe this is the first time she's set foot in Oakhurst in several years."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Looking back on it, there probably were signs of what the Muhlen's had up their sleeves.  They were very secretive with each other, to be sure.  How in the hell were we supposed to know they were evil, though?  They've been pillars of the community.  The general store they run is beyond remonstration; they are fantastic business people and generous members of the Council."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam speaks up, "What about the vote on these boys' idea, huh?  We should have pressed them more, there.  Should have known something was foul.  Wasn't the first time on that, neither."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam spits out the door, into the dusty walkway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad shakes his head, still looking uncomfortable.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They look down at the parchment.</p><p>Rhahlad starts guffawing.</p><p>Bazad looks like he's going to be sick.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam scratches his head.  "Am...  Am I missing something.  What is that?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad says, "It's some childish prank!  Who gave that to you, seriously?!  That's the best joke I've ever seen, ha.  You boys are all right...  Ah.  I needed that."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>A pale blue comes over the wizard’s eyes as he says this.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rhahlad stops laughing immediately.  "Whoa, whoa, I meant no offense, gentlemen, honestly I didn't.  I've no idea what you'd been through, don't blame me if i thought you were putting us on with this."  He taps the paper.</p><p>Looking back and forth between the four others, he says, "You all seriously don't know what this is?  The 'black spot'?  You've never heard the old sailor's tales of the 'black spot'?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad and Vam look on in confusion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well...  that's fair.  Story's simple really, there're tales about pirates receiving this same mark, parchment with a ink spot on it, when they're marked for death.  I thought it was a mere child's story..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam shakes his head, studies the parchment again.  </p><p>"Can you point out the runes, here?  I don't see anything like that."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue’s fingers glow white as he twirls his triumvirate with increasing vigor.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The big man is now sitting on a padded bench, away from the group, close to the window at the front of the house.  He's chewing his nails and his knees are bouncing rapidly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter turns imploringly toward the large uncomfortable man.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad starts whining, pitching higher and higher.  He holds his hands on his ears on both sides of his head.  He rocks back and forth, slowly at first...  then he picks up pace.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes a nearby glass of water and levitates the contents over toward Bazad. He shapes it slowly into each rune in the circle in front of the man's face trying to force him out of his shocked reticence.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bazad continues to rock, hands over ears.  He is staring directly at the runic waterscape.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter produces a flame and disperses the water into a cloud of steam.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter casts a sideward glance at Maouelue as he winks in recognition of their classic hot cop cold cop routine.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Blood starts coming out of Bazad's eyes and ears.  Soon his eyesockets rain blood down his face.  He's screaming and still rocking back and forth.  Suddenly he bolts upright and runs for the front door, bumping into Vam and the door frame on his way out.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sends out restraining vines to prevent the man's flight.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vines come out and somehow the man stumbles through them, running like a man posessed through the streets of Oakhurst.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Strange bits of sand fall off of the dunegrass summoned by Dieter's entangling vines. As Maouelue sees the spell fizzle as Bazad gets away, and in a fit of inspiration pulls up several grains and sends them out ins a z-shaped wave toward the fleeing man!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you make your way toward the prone man...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ground shakes beneath you.  Lines of dirt and sand puff and blow into the air.  The lines circle around the group, making their way indirectly towards the man lying in the street.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter calls out his charge, two snake-like creatures <i>pop</i> from the ground around Bazad!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter takes Vam's hand and gestures toward the rope, then begins to stand up and head that way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As he begins up the ladder, he thinks of the snake and sees something gleaming in his bag. The mirror...Frenchy...He'd have to keep that in mind going forward. This was another near-fatal encounter.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue checks over the body of the snake.  It's pretty hideous.  He's a constrictor snake, about 12 feet long.  Good meat for the taking, the hide is very valuable if tanned and treated correctly.  It wasn't poisonous, and even though it could speak and had smallish appendages that could have been called arms, it did not use weapons.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue picks up his orbs and wipes them off on his robe. He tries to being hauling the snake back toward the opening and calls to Vam for assistance.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two heroes, a bit shaken by their previous run in, have a bit of a restless time getting to sleep.  The majority of the night is peaceful.  There comes a time, right when the moon is just past the midpoint of its apex, when both men have the same dream...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p><i>The darkness opens onto an entrance.  Runes are etched, but these are not the ones you're searching for.  There are many hazards here, many ways to die.  You enter and pass rooms, pass through hallways untouched by human eyes for generations.  You come upon a large hall, filled with statues holding up the ceiling.  These enormous statues depict lizardfolk in battle.  Victorious over their foes.  A strange feeling comes over you as you turn to see more lizardfolk around you, but these are not statues.  These are snake-people...  Snakes with humanoid features.  Arms on some, legs on others.  All with scales or some semblance of leathery hide.  They take you and tie you to the dias at the end of the big hall.  They pierce your side, let the blood run down the dias into a pool.  Whispery footsteps can be heard, a path is made by the crowd to let</i> him <i>in.  You catch a blurred glimpse of the smiling face as you succumb to your injuries.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two magic users waken at first light, their eyes feeling somewhat heavier than usual. They each rise, stretch, and take care of their morning usuals. They each then take their newly crafted heirlooms outside into the morning light and dew for a spot of meditation and exercise. As they pose and twirl about in the sunbeams, the silver of their weapons twinkles and bends the light into waving spectra cascading over the ranch. Dieter imagines a cyclone from his past and spins around in sweeping arcs, while Maouelue plays at sending ice crystals around his orbs and watches the angled refractions dance. He casually lobs one over at the spinning Dieter, who spots it mid turn and strikes it with the eagle end of his bladestaff. The orb soars out into the field amongst the animals. The two catch each other’s eyes and smile. They needed this moment after the haranguing pressures of the previous days. The stop their exercises and climb over the corral fencing to go and retrieve the ball, taking note of the animals along the way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are few in the field, and only sparse farm hands out.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both spy smoke coming from near the house.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two men cut short their heats and quickly pivot to inspect the source of the smoke.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam and Heston have started a cookfire outside.  They've set out massive strips of white-grey meat, set to throw them on the fire as it builds.</p><p>"Mornin' friends!  How about some fresh snake meat to break your fast, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam chuckles and says, "Now, gimme second to sear the damned thing!  Unless you take yours rarified!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston chuckles too, concentrating on honing his knife but listening to the happenings of the farm in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The meat is cooked to perfection, and stories are told around the breakfast camp fire.  (Anything you want to ask Vam or Heston?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Heston sits back in his seat, taking a chew off his plug of tobacco, offers it around.  Vam declines, the takes a deep breath and pushes his plate away.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well, good sirs, I don't rightly know where to start.  Don't know if I'm going to enlighten you folks, either.  But I can tell you what happened after you slipped off to dreamland last night."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Bunch of us, we stayed up taking care of this here snake.  Bellatrix came through and told us Douglas was ready for burial, so we took care of that in the patch the town's reserved for such things.  Bellatrix ended up taking off after that, but she mentioned that we might want someone to watch over the graveyard that night, just in case.  I put one of my hands on it, he didn't see anything amiss all night.  Not a hide nor hair from Bazad.  Rhahlad did come back, but only for a few seconds.  Heston here scared him right off, just showed him what you gents faced down in the streets last night."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So...  I guess the best way to begin about Douglas and Culver is to say, I really don't <i>know</i> all that much.  Culver was a staple of the town, Douglas just seemed to be a passer-by.  They got to drinking together, guess that was their bond.  There was a miner friend of theirs, too, used to keep the end three stools at the Pig warm, if you know what I'm gettin' at.  Didn't interact with Douglas, but Culver and I go way back.  Get most all of my supplies from him.  Shame to hear he's gone missing."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"There was some scuttlebutt about Culver and Douglas dealing with the big man from the Pig, calls hisself Molur.  People say they were looking for something for him, maybe laundering it through Culver's store.  But that's all hearsay, I've never had a bad deal from Culver.  He's a good 'un."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"As far as them having a link to the Muhlen's, that's a no go.  S'far as I know," he sucks his teeth a bit, trying to wean out a bit of loose snake meat, "They don't have any connection at all.  There're all sorts and sizes of stories about the Muhlen's.  They're the royalty of Oakhurst.  Matter of fact, they used to have a mansion house not too far from here.  All decrepit now, not any place anyone could live in.  Their maw and paw used to live up there, along with gallons of children!  So many running all over the damned place!  The father, he had his life tied up into that mine, Krytos Hill.  When the belly went up on it, so did his fortune, and he moved right outta here, taking the whole family with him.  All except Veena and Hozieh.  They had already set up shop here and didn't want to head out."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Years passed, they became a staple of the town.  Some would even say the cornerstone.  We get so many just passing through, to have an established community started to make us think we could make something outta this place."  He takes a long, deep breath.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Shoulda figured it was too good to be true.  Those missing children.  Only happened for a short time, and stopped when Bellatrix went away.  They coulda been planning that for a while.  I bet Bellatrix might even have more to say on the subject, but she's scarred from the experience.  Surprised to even see her in town.  Horrible what we did to her, accused her of.  I'm rambling, but the bottom line is this - we had no idea they were witches or magicians or whatever they are.  We had no idea they were rotting this town from the inside out.  And wherever they are now, well they can just get going straight to hell, because if they ever come back to Oakhurst again...  We're going to have ourselves a mighty fine bonfire that night, I can tell you that."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam looks up and shakes his head.  "You gentlemen be careful if you go searchin' for trouble.  These women... they're insidious.  If they could be right next to us for so long and us not know anything?  They're capable of anything."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam ponders for a moment, trying to think back to anything he can remember that can help you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>His eyes widen and he opens his mouth in astonishment.</p><p>"I can't believe I didn't see it before."  He looks at the both of you.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Bazad.  Bazad was acting real strange, right?  Like he was hiding something.  He was on the Council too, and I just keep recalling that most of the votes, he went along with nearly everything Hozieh said.  Even if it didn't make sense, he was always...  I haven't thought about those kids in the yard for such a long time, but...  I think...  Guys, I think Bazad was their brother."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam shrugs, then nods.  Heston pipes up, gruff voice sounding like gravel being ground, "I can track just 'bout anythin'.  There's no trail on the one that got away.  The tunnels are being repaired by some folks from the town, but I'd say you could follow them, if you can find a way down into one.  Looks like they head south."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam adds, "That's the direction of the old Muhlen place.  You can catch the river south of here and follow it a few miles southeast.  Their place is about two hundred yards from the river, 'bout ten, fifteen miles down as the river flows."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue looks up at Dieter slightly reproachfully, but obliges.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You bet!"  He whistles over to the farm hands, but Heston pats him on the shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Vam's good with you pickin' what you need.  Oh, and I wanted to ask you guys somethin'..."  He trails off, looking a little sheepish.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"No, it's just...  I could use that snake skin for so many different things.  I was hoping I could use some of it.  Not all, mind ye.  Just wanted to try my hand at a few things.  Some boots, a vest, maybe some leather armor or something padded-like?   I unnerstand if you guys wanted to sell it or something..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter smiles wrily.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks at you expectantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sizes up the Clydesdale and Maouelue runs his fingers over the ashen beauty of the Criollo.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks giddy, which is an odd look for a cowboy.</p><p>"Ah, thanks so much!  I'll get going on that right away.  Pointy hat, jerkin, and bracers.  Got it!"  He tips his hat and run-shuffles away.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The heroes smile after him fondly then lead their chosen steeds out of the paddock, heading back over to Vam to give their thanks.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Vam turns from cleaning the breakfast, putting out the cookfire.   He says, "...  When I was a kid, my pa used to tell me a scary tale of the Baba Yaga.  Ever hear of it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two mages shake their heads and listen intently.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well...  She's the witch of all witches.  Had scads of children, some famous wizards in their own right.  If you can bring back those two, alive, or something close to it, I want to ask them a question.  If you can't bring them back, ask them this question for me - Is it true that the Yaga still lives?  I'd be forever in your debt if you find the answer to that question, gentlemen."  He nods, solemnly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, and be careful of that Criollo.  Her name's Ashpeak.  And she likes to bite."  He smiles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue repeats, "Ashpeak...steady girl..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She calmly looks back at the wizards.  And whinnies.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter and Maouelue secure their posessions and mount the two horses, heading South toward the manor.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The adventurous adventurers head south from the Stuniz ranch, steering their new mounts with great ease and ability.  (Animal handing, just for fun.  Advantage for both.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The horses listen to the two adventurers...  for the most part.  A few miles into the trip, you come to a river.  It's about 60 feet across, and the water level looks fairly deep.  It's a dark blue, moving well so the bottom is decently obscured.  That being said, you have already seem some fish darting about, occasionally one jumps out of the water.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Sitting on the bank of the river, about a couple hundred feet away, is a figure.  It looks like they might be fishing.  They're sitting on a small shoal where the edge of the bank meets the water smoothly.  For most of the trip, the river bank has been about two feet above the water level.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The riders being their horses to a gentle canter and approach the figure, waving casually in their direction.</i></p><p>“Ho there!”, shouts Dieter</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both see a halfling man, hairy feet dipped in the water, lying back on the shoal, eyes closed.  As you hail him, he opens his eyes, props himself up on an elbow, and says (in a <i>thick</i> cockney brogue), "Ahoy there lads, ahoy there and how're ye doing this fine day, eh?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Those are kind words and kind faces, lads!  Well met, well met indeed.  I was just sunning meself by the bank here, taking a load off as they say.  Been traveling far and anon, singing my songs, telling my tales, of that you can be sure.  The domain...  Oh, aye, the old mansion atop the hill, aye, looks like there could be some good stories about that place, aye, indeed.  Sadly, Briffo Lightfoot has no such knowledge of that stormy looking place..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He gets up and moves to his pack. "I do have some items that are needing a good home, though?"  He looks at you two, expectantly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"...  Uh..."  His almost juvenile smile falters massively.  His skin takes on a green pallor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Um...  Sh...  Sure, lads.  Let us away!  Did you want to see the wares first, or would you like to see a test of the stores, so to speak?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He looks more heartened at this prospect, and opens his bag.</p><p>"Briffo Lightfoot carries many a potion, these are but some of what I have to offer," and he pulls out five bottles.  One is red and swirling, a second is a larger bottle of the same variety liquid.  The next is cloudy green, and there looks to be a jellyfish-like creature swimming in it.  The penultimate is a dark purple brew with green bubbles drifting throughout.  Lastly, there is a strange, small vial.  This one is almost pearlescent, rainbow veins of light swirl through it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Also, I have these," he puts out a cloth with three rings on them.  One is golden, banded with flecks of emerald.  There is a platinum one with a crest of a shield as a figurehead.  There is another gold one, very scratched and pock-marked.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They look over the potions and ask after their effects. Maouelue inspects the set of rings closely inquiring about...pricing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, and don't forget these here!"  He takes a roll off of his bag and unravels a few more items, giggling as he does so.  There are a couple small stones he's wrapped tightly together, both with a single matching rune on them.  A long stick of yew wood.  Lastly, there is an oddly glowing rod of a strange material.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Both men look at each other, then the runes on the stones, casting their mind to the rune coins and thinking whether these match any of them.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, pricing, of course!  I could see you are class fellows, I'll give you my friends discount on all of these items.  Now, the bottles are as follows - potions of healing, lesser and greater there.  A potion of waterbreating.  A potion of...  something with necrosis...  And that last... Well, that's a special one.  Not...  not quite sure what that one does.  Looks fancy, though, aye?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He begins digging out the unidentified elven boots and cloak as well as the shortswords of poisoning and the bandolier of poison vials, then lays them out for any potential identification.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, bartering!  I would <i>love</i> to see...  And <i>what</i> do we have <i>here</i>?!?!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halfling sets to checking out the items you have.  Dieter and Maouelue pick up the stones, unwrap them from their binding and investigate their nature.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rune is not one from the set you've been looking for, but the wizard does recognize it.  These are sending stones.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few minutes in, Briffo gets uncomfortable.  "Say fellows, where...  um...  where did you get these items.  Now, mind you, I'm not opposed to some pilfered objects.  Been known to dabble in that trade myself.  Long time ago.  But these...  Lets just say, these are assassin's tools.  The shortswords are enchanted with poison.  This belt - full of poison vials!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The boots, enchanted with a stealth spell!  The cloak is elven for sure, I can only assume it has something similar on it.  Too powerful for my detection, though."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Where might someone concoct such filth? With what reagents?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue studies the rings with arcane intent.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"First ring there is poison resistance, second one, like the one I have on here, is a ring of protection.  Last one...  Again, I'm at a loss.  Looks pretty beat up.  Don't really remember where I came across it.  Haven't the heart to get rid of it, and no one seems to want to buy it."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter picks up the scratched gold ring, looking at it more closely.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter can't quite tell what it is, looks in very bad shape.  Maouelue points to the rod, and the halfling smiles widely.  "Let me show you!"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He picks it up, says, "Stand back a bit."  Then he points the wand in the air and <i>whoosh</i> an string of fire darts straight up into the sky.  It climbs, climbs, climbs...  When it's almost out of sight, and looks like it might have fizzled out, the wizard and druid let out the breath they were holding.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then...  <i>BOOM</i> the sky is lit up by a dazzling fireworks display!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A myriad of colors pop and fizz and explode, to the delighted clapping of Briffo.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"The rod of Sky Explosions!  Might need some work on the title.  But the results speak for themselves!  Played a show once where someone set these off while I was playing.  Very good time, I can tell you."  He smiles, reminiscing.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halfling is a <i>whirl</i> of emotions.  He was very enthusiastic to play, starting to take out his shawm, but slowly puts it away, nodding that it might be better to conclude business.  His face is extremely malleable, and he wears his emotions right out front!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Positively, good men, I couldn't agree more.  What... ah... What exactly are we going to that house for?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Do you have any experience in...the art of altercation Briffo?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Oh, I've been in a scrap once or thrice, but, if I'm hearing you correctly...  Nothing of that like, no..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gestures to the Light Crossbow slung across his Clydesdale and the shortswords laid out amongst the tradegoods.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The halfling looks from you two to the weapons to the horses, then back to you.  He steels himself and says, "I've been on the sidelines for far too long.  Why not, eh?!  Time to <i>make</i> some stories, not just tell of them!  I'm with ye, lads!  Er...  whoever ye are!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group spends some time divvying up equipment. Dieter hands over the crossbow and poison shortswords. He dons the elven boots and hands the robe over to Maouelue to do the same. He picks up the bandolier and considers it, then looks at Briffo.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>While Dieter asks this, Maouelue picks up the RoSE and turns the three rings over in his other hand.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I might be persuaded...  If the fiend was foul enough!"</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The three stare at the ring, waiting with bated breath. Maouelue can not quite put his finger on the significance, but Dieter’s gaze is intensifying.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“</p><p>I...</p><p>II...</p><p>III...</p><p>“</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter glances askance at Maouelue, who now seems to be slipping into some sort of trance, whether voluntary or not is indiscernible.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter places the ring back in Briffo’s hand and folds the halfling’s fingers around it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Matter of fact, why not put that ring to the test. Let’s wipe this flour off you and have you scout our exit. Should you see any more ghouls, stay our progress and we shall deliberate. Lead on Briffo.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter’s attempt at a smooth snapping trick singes his fingertips. Chastened by shame, he produces his flame in the conventional manner.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(Crazy night, just getting back in from yard work, etc!)</p><p>As the group stares at the ring, flames dance along it's mirrored surface.  The flames change to ghastly faces, to glyphs, to writing, to faces again...  The three shake their heads, as if trying to rid themselves of the visions.  The wizard, for just a moment, seizes on something from the long distant past.  A tale of old forgotten lore regarding a lost ring of invisibility and...  was it fire?  Eons ago, there was a story about a lost ring...  But as soon as it comes, the memory goes.  </p><p></p><p>Briffo takes the ring back, almost conspiratorially.   He shakes off some of the dust, puts the ring back on, then leads the group northward through the NE door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Towering bookcases line the walls and stretch across this room, but there are only a few books left on them.  A lounging area is furnished for comfort, though the leather looks aged.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are six main bookshelves, all marked with sigils.  Two couches and a few side tables are arranged for relaxed study.  There are several candelabra here, a couple still have hale candles in them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They inspect the sigil labels and compare notes, then begin to look amongst the books.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Some of the sigils are familiar, a couple Maouelue doesn't know.  (D30 for number of books.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a contemporary interesting book entitled 'Physiologies of Magical Creatures' - Information on the biology of Beholders, Dragons, Unicorns, and more. Full of diagrams. This book is a little more eye-catching than most other mundane books.</p><p></p><p>This book is in mint condition. It is written in Common Speech. It has a lengthy foreword or dedication to someone.</p><p></p><p>This book is worth 50 gps and has 145 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a old skill book entitled Unearthed Theories on Knowledge. This book is meant to increase a wizards intelligence.

It is obviously not written in the author's mother tongue.</p><p>This book is worth 65 gps and has 214 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a recently written skill book entitled Unambiguous Conceptions on Intimidation. This book is meant to teach intimidation techniques. (This could be used as a permanent or temporary stat increase if read and studied.)</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Common Speech. It has a haughty and authoratative tone.</p><p>This book is worth 40 gps and has 505 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You find a contemporary biography entitled Exposed Triumphs of the Guild.</p><p>This book is torn/stained pretty badly. Some of the pages are missing. It is written in Magical Writing (Requires Magical Deciphering). It looks to be a part of a series of volumes.</p><p>This book is worth 10 gps and has 543 pages.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a bandolier hanging on the bookshelf by a door to the W.  There is a hallway on the E wall, on it's south end.  There is another door on it's north end.  This one looks stained with something...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter walks over to inspect the bandolier.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He compares it to the poison one he carries.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a very nicely made leather bandolier, this one carries parchment.  Scroll cases and buckles adorn the carrier.  Oddly, it looks almost new.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He pulls it down and puts it on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a good fit!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They move east through the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group goes through the hallway.  More wear and tear can be seen through here.  Tapestries are moth eaten or completely ripped down.  The hallway widens to a small entry room.  A door to the N and a door to the E.  The door to the N looks stained with something.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue nods to the group and they head over to the stained door to inspect.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's mildew.  It doesn't seem damp on this side of the door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue pushes on the door and tries to open it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's hard to push initially.  All three of the group give it a go, and with a scraping, the door eases inward.  A short hallway opens into what looks like a green room.  Literally, the entire room is green with mildew and lichen, decay and rot and filth.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a large bowl in the center of the room, also covered in green mold.  (This whole floor works as difficult terrain, which means your speed per round is halved.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you ease in further to the room you see six symmetrical doors.  One on the W and E walls, two on the N and S walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue extends a ghostly hand out into the middle of the room to try  and pick up the bowl to retrieve it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bowl is larger than the hand, and is covered in a slippery green slime...  (Strength check with advantage, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mage hand lifts the bowl and brings it to the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The hand sets it down in the previous room just outside the door to the right. Maouelue directs the hand to wipe away the slime. Dieter tries to determine what the bowl is made of.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hand moves over the bowl, wiping slime and muck away.  It starts scooping out the inside as well, you see ashes coming out along with the slime.  The slime comes off, but there is still a greenish residue left after the muck is wiped completely off.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter guides his flame over gently singeing a small patch of the residue, trying to break through and see the material.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Small patches of bronze can be seen under patches of the green oxidization.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter continues to burn away what he can while the hand wipes away the char and polishes the bowl. Maouelue looks for any kind of marking.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>No special markings adorn the bowl.  The polishing reveals a bronze brazier.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter places his flame in the brazier and Maouelue directs the hand to pick it up and float ahead as they walk. They turn back out of the gross room and over to the East door, once again trying to open it.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Loaded and saved data for Briffo Lightfoot!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(For ease of convenience -)</p><p>The party try both E doors.  The E door from the entry way leads to the main foyer with the staircase to the strange door.  The E door from the 'green' room leads to the art gallery.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The party heads out to the front door and tries to exit the building. Briffo needs a hot minute to chill.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party is set to leave. As they approach the large double doors, they hear a hissing from just outside them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The two magic users flank the inside of the door.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Briffo nods, puts on the ring, and his invisible self starts to open the door slowly.   (Stealth check from everybody!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hissing stops abruptly.  The door, pushed by the invisible halfling, continues to open.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue whispers for Briffo to sneak behind the snake then prepares a frosty ball. Dieter prepares a sneak attack.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue whispers to Briffo.  And in that instant, the wizard sees a giant snake's head rear up from beyond the doorway.  It opens it's mouth, bares it's fangs silently.  With a hiss, it strikes downward at Briffo...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And misses the halfling.  Must have been the luck of the little people.  Either way...</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The snake, bloodied and in a frenzy, snaps it's tail to throw the halfling across the room.  Whether it be the healing he just received or the intensity of his will to live, Briffo hangs on to the tail last moment, jumping clear of anyone else in the room.  Maouelue, however, wasn't as fortunate.  The tail comes straight at the wizard, knocking him prone (and dealing...)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Thank you, good sirs.  Thought I was a goner there for a moment.  Can't believe he could see me," says Briffo, taking off his ring.

<div class="character-0"><p><i>They proceed to the north  doors and peek through both.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The one on the NW opens into damp, disgusting scraps of what used to be towels and linens.  The NE door opens onto various bottles and vials on shelves.</p></div>

Although they both want things to be different, the vacant stare of their newly found and newly gone friend is both heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.

There are many places where the fire even swept into the basement level, clearing out whatever was down there.

<div class="character-1"><p>The runes are in Giant.  Maouelue is having a hard time placing the dialect or the area, but giant runes are naturally magical.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The runes on the coins read 'Runemark'.  The runes on the door are a hodge-podge, it was designed to be that way.  The specific runes in the rooms and on the parchment don't really have a correlation to anything.  You're getting the feeling that the 'runemark' password was a trap.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They touch the runes I II III IV in order</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door...  opens majestically.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As it pushes inward, you see a cozily lit study, of sorts.  Bookshelves line the walls, the books covered in heavy leather and looking very old.  There is a massive bear-skin rug on the floor, a considerable trophy of skill and strength.  There are numerous chests in this room as well.  The entire room is lit by what looks to be ever-lasting candles.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter bristles at the bear display.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue admires the candles, then pulls out the wand of secrets and releases one of its charges, searching for traps or hidden doors.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter inspects the bookshelves.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wand of secrets pings, points to a corner where a beautiful set of plate armor stands upright.  There is a base where the armor stand could be moved toward the door of the room.  The plate is a burnished steel, but it looks to have oxidized a bit, giving it an interesting black-green sheen to it.  The metal is dull and does not reflect any of the light shining on it. </p><p></p><p>The books smell musty but not in a damp sort of way.  They must have been here for centuries, you figure.  (History check for more!)  Maouelue takes down a book or two, inspects them.  They are in a language that is almost impossible to read... as the word never stop moving on the page.  Line after line, picture after picture, the books are a maze of movement.  Diagrams drip between pages, margins are attacked and seized.  There are many books like this.  Although, as Maouelue searches, he does find a few that are able to be read... by a wizard.  (d6 roll, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p><i>'The Tao of Earth' - Starts with philosophical musings about the importance of creation and stability over destruction and change.

<div class="character-1"><p>There are a couple interesting items that catch your eyes as well...</p><p>As the wizard searches books, his eye catches on a jar full of wildly colored mushrooms.  They seem to give off a dull red aura as well.  You've never even heard of such a thing!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just before Dieter checks the armor, he spies a knotty staff, more a long branch than an actual staff, that has some green leaves sprouting from the top.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue tries looking through the bins, sifting through the coins.  The connection to what's off isn't hitting the wizard, but he knows something is off.  Something strange about the feel of the coins.  The weight...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two adventurers try their hands at the ornate chest.  There are no thieves' tools, however the men find a few bits and bobs that could work.  Alas, they do not.  The lock is still in place, but there are no traps.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>They look around for a key</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tosses one of the rune coins they carry into the gold ones.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue takes the branch from the corner and attempts to lower it into the coins.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue gets a very deep sense of earth, soil, trees, a jungle.  The staff touches the coins.  Nothing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He packs the staff away and tries to dump one of the coin cheats over.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Umm...dieter, can you help me with this?”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter looks at Maouelue, then shrugs and pulls out his mirror.  Looking into its depths he sees a mustachioed man dragging a cigarette wink back at him.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The bottoms of the trunks are normal, typical wear and tear.  They seem like they've had water damage at some time or other, but nothing to hurt the solidity of them.  The coins do make a leaden thump instead of a ring, which is strange for gold.  You might expect that with silver, or even copper.   Gold pieces, though, usually have a bit more metallic clang to them.  These do not.  As for the staff...</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gives it a cursory pull to see if it will open yet.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It opens wide, and there are some interesting things in there...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A bevy of weapons and items greet your gaze.  A longsword sheathed in a gorgeously made scabbard.  A set of bracers with Giant runes emblazoned all over them.  A plate helm with a rime of frost on it.   A mace that glints mischievously.  A silver ring with rubies inset in a cross lies on the floor of the chest, as does a beat up looking piece of lead... with 'Runemark' inscribed on it in a circle.  Lastly, a shield with the visage of a dragon being ridden by a wizard is attached to the underside of the chest's top.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter picks up the shield and tests its balance.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group takes a short while to sit and consider the items they have found here. The henchmen take a look at the helm and mace, Dieter looks at the bracers and shield, and Maouelue looks at the ring and staff.</i></p></div>

The tree bears only two pieces of fruit per growth.  This fruit, when consumed, heals 1 disease and does 8d4+8 healing.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>A pure feeling of life seems to seep into Dieter's being as he takes the staff from Maouelue.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The shield is called the Shield of Disruption.  Adds +1 to your AC and it has 4 charges to impose a CON save (DC10+Intelligence modifier) on a creature using any spell.  You can spend 1 charge against the spell, or spend more for higher level spells.  (If you wanted to counter a spell at 5th level or above, the DC would go down by 3 for every level higher.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace twinkles in the candlelight.  This is the Mace of Reduction.  The attack and damage rolls have +1, crits on 19 and 20, and on a natural 20 the target is under the effect of the <i>Reduce</i> spell.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group ruffles through the burgeoning bags of holding to produce the Barbarian’s Wind tome. Dieter holds it in his hand and speaks the rune using his most ostentatious form of Giant.  (He loves to be very presentational in front of the henchmen...)</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the druid holds the book aloft and speaks the Giant rune, the book glows a glittery blue hue.  The words on the page magically rearrange themselves into different words, pictures, diagrams.  As they come together and form a completely new tome, a sharp pain courses through Dieter's head.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Fighting back the pain, Dieter attempts to pore over the tome and withdraw its secrets.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the words coalesce, Dieter has a harder and harder time concentrating on the book.  At the height of his ability, he's still not able to comprehend the language or read the book at all.  His headache starts to get worse...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Stenchy picks it up and hands it over to Dieter, who hastily puts it on, not fully knowing what it will do.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It's a bit awkward to hold the book while putting the helm on, but Stenchy lends a hand to help him sort it out.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the helm goes on, a feeling of sharp cold comes over Dieter.  It helps quell the pain of his head, but only momentarily.  (Is he still trying to read it?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The cold abates and Dieter starts feeling comfortably warm, noticing for perhaps the first time how cold his surroundings really were before.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter sets the book down momentarily and produces a flame, he sends a bit of it into each of the emptied rune chests to provide some additional light and heat in the room. He gestures to Maouelue to take a look at the book.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouleue picks up the tome and tries to read some of it as well. He wonders whether he'll have the same searing experience.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue is able to read it perfectly.  It is the musings of an arcanist who was obsessed an ancient race of people called the Netherese.  The land of Netheril was located where the Anauroch desert is today, and a mageocracy of peoples inhabited the land.  Thousands of years ago, the archmages of Netheril controlled magics unheard of, and with their prideful demise, most of the artifacts and knowledge died with them.  That did not stop this particular arcanist from searching, and clearly finding, books and items from the bygone era.  This spellbook is both an account of what the arcanist was able to glean from the books in this library, as well as his dabbling into some of the forgotten magics therein.  The books and items in this room are priceless, worth more than a mansion in Waterdeep for some buyers.  Collectively, you could be looking at millions of platinum to the right person.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group packs up their things and Dieter coalesces the fire and moves it over toward the plate armor.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The word falls from Dieter's lips, the runes on the coins glow but the coins are unaffected other than that.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tries a few more words in Giant.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>At dragon, the obsidian base shakes, and starts moving forward.  (Dex save for Stenchy!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter, still concentrating on the runes and coins, is caught off guard when the base moves.  (One more Dex save to catch yourself before you fall down a hole!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter falls backwards down the hole that is uncovered by the moving base.  He flails down, falling about 20 feet before clutching onto a rung of a ladder.  It stops his fall, but deals -</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Nine points of damage, nearly wrenching his shoulder out of socket.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The rest of you, use the blasted ladder..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter calls his flames down after him and spreads them about.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hole is four by four, so it's about as big as a person.  Not too too much room to move around, but Dieter can light up the hole.  The ladder descends <i>far</i> into the earth.  The light shines about twenty feet down, just shows darkness beneath.  The druid throws the flame down.  It travels down, down, down...  Normally it would peter out 30 feet away, this one goes for a bit longer.   And it fades before hitting anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy drops one down and Dieter catches it, whispering "Runemark" to it before dropping it as well.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It lights up and falls...  falls... falls...  the light fades into the darkness.  No sound of the coin hitting anything.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter's form begins to shrink, then disappear into the darkness...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter, realizing too late he's only a fledgling druid, changes his form of choice at the last moment and becomes....</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue calls a spirit bat to his side and instructs it to follow Dieter down into the hole and be his eyes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The spider moves 20 feet per 6 seconds.  SpiDieter crawls vertically down the shaft, moving swiftly.  Three hundred feet down, a full minute and a half later, the spider feels the wall turn away ninety degrees to create the ceiling of a massive cavern.  Stalactites dot the roof of the cavern, making it difficult for the spider to see farther than five feet in front.  From this vantage point, the spiDieter cannot see the floor of the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The bat sees Dieter continuing down the ladder, does a quick 100ft lap of the cavern ceiling, then begins heading back up to Maouelue to report.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bat, who has excellent echolocation, scopes out the cavern and maps it mentally for Maouelue...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ladder lets out into the SE corner of the cavern.  The bat could <i>not</i> get a good estimate on how <i>deep</i> the particular areas of water are, however.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue considers the news and is at least glad to hear that there is a indeed a bottom to the pit...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He sighs in resignation and produces a mage hand to assist the fellows in their descent. He sends Stenchy down first as he has the heaviest armor and focuses the hand on him.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The group makes their way down the ladder.  It's not as rickety as you would think, the handholds are secure.  There is a bit of a scare when Frenchy slips on a rung.  Other than that, everyone gets down.  The water at the edge of the cavern, at the bottom of the ladder, is only a foot deep.  The henchmen are wading, waiting for the wizard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The Henchy brothers each light a torch as they look for drier footing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The water extends before the brothers' torches.  Maouelue can just see the edge of a small island in the middle of the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue drops down the final rung and looks around. He looks around for Dieter but doesn't see him. He takes a few tentative steps toward the center island, pulling out his Quarterstaff to test the depth as he goes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue takes four steps, then the staff registers the floor falls away abruptly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He beckons to the Henchys to follow him and walks around the perimeter counter clockwise to a small just he sees on the East wall. He once again tests the waters as he steps out and gauges the distance to the center. It looks to him like about 20ft at that point. He begins to pull up a large cube of water from the area, hovering it in the air and spinning the 125 cubic feet of water in a mesmerizing ball that flickers reflections of the flames all over the cavern. He slowly begins to extend the water into a long bridge, similar to the one used above ground, this time considering the terrain, he makes it slightly narrower with higher sides to act as railings. He then leads the group across, giving Dieter time to do...whatever it is he needed to do so badly...</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The little island is made of shale and rough stone.  There is signs of someone or something being here recently.  Signs of a fire, scorch mark are on the ground in a couple places.  Bones litter the area.</p></div>

Although it is getting late, they have one more push in them before turning in for a longer rest. Maouelue creates another ice bridge and the crew heads back to the NE tunnel.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy raises a finger to his lips, then kisses the legendary ring Dieter just let him borrow then immediately disappears. He heads further down the tunnel to scout it out, unseen.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>As Frenchy heads off, Dieter notices Stenchy still looking a bit the worse for wear and hands him a red bottle to quaff.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party gathers their things from the respite, Frenchy heads off further down the tunnel.  (Perception for everyone except Frenchy.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The henchman goes invisible and searches the path.  The green light has faded, as has all of the torchlight from the interior of the cave.  It is pitch black down the tunnel.  About forty feet in, Frenchy bangs his toes on the wall of the cave as the direction moves from NE to due E.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The group moves together along the NE tunnel.  Frenchy sees much better now, noticing that after forty or so feet, the tunnel takes a turn due E.  The light shines forty feet in advance of the party, dimming at the edge of that distance.  The tunnel continues straight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party starts noticing that the tunnel looks carved out of the clay heavy soil.  It is ten feet high, a little less than ten feet wide.  The walls look damp but not wet.  A heavy smell of earth hangs everywhere.  Along with the tang of iron, but that could be from your bloodstained clothes...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The silence is the worst part.  Sounds echo, every footfall, even though they're quiet, sound like a heavily laden <i>thump</i> as you all walk.  Stenchy sounds like a bucket of silverware jouncing around.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue winces at each echoing step, but there's not much for it at this point. He makes a palms down gesture to Stenchy trying to get him to lighten his footsteps. Stenchy makes a show of understanding and doing so, but it does almost nothing to change the clatter.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter tells Maouelue and Stenchy to hold for a moment and takes the torch from Stenchy, moving forward along the passage with Frenchy to scout a bit more stealthily.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the two proceed stealthily up the tunnel, they come to a bisection in the path.  One tunnel goes NE, the other SE.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is keen to keep track of the crew while they wait, maintaining their stealth. He re-summons his spirit bat to keep track of the scouts.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>On second thought, there's no time for that nonsense. Maouelue slowly leads the fighter forward with his elf vision making sure to stay well behind any sign of the light from their companions.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter makes a mark in the ground with his staff pointing down the SE corridor and moves forward with Frenchy. They hear some plated footfalls distantly behind them and get a sense of what's going on.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The pair travel down the path, cautiously looking around, taking in everything.  </p><p>(Perception check from both, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Frenchy moves his foot slowly down the path, he feels the floor... change.  It is raised in this part.  Not significantly, but enough for him to feel it under his boot.  He puts a hand out to stop Dieter from passing him.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy stoops down to inspect the change in the floor and beckons Dieter to do the same.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is a distinct line of something on the floor.  (Frenchy or Dieter can get his fingers underneath it, if they want.)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter digs underneath the object carefully, brushing away the debris.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's a padded piece of wood, the covering made to look and feel like the surrounding floor.  It lifts easily... and the stench of rotting, decaying meat hit you both full and hard. (CON save.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>You both feel an urge to vomit as the wood plank is moved away.  It stretches the width of the floor and extends to fifteen feet forward down the tunnel.  The wood feels flimsy under your fingers.  You both can also see that the tunnel tapers at the edge of the torch light.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Steadying themselves and holding their breath, they look for what might be the source of the stench under the board.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The board is moved back, slowly, carefully.  A trench full of body parts, in various states of decay, lie ten feet deep.  Sharp points of some sort stick up here and there within the pit.  As you peer further into the miasma or filth...  something moves.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two watch as whatever is in the grossness moves from their left to right, getting slightly farther away from them in the process.  Sick gurgling sounds, squelching and liquid <i>flops</i> can be heard as the thing moves around.  It doesn't seem to sense your presence, for the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>What used to be limbs get sucked below the mire as you both watch on.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The torch sticks into the abdomen of what might have been an orc, it's green skin turning mottled black, blue, and purple.  It descends almost to the fire, but stays steadfastly pointed up.  (Stealth checks for both again, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The movement from underneath the pile stops suddenly.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter cannot make out the size and shape or movement of this creature, but Frenchy believes he does.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Frenchy spots something slinking towards the pair...  Then loses it.  He thought it looked like a slug of some sort, but didn't get a great look at it when it surfaced?  Did it surface?  The smell is somehow getting stronger.  (CON save, please, for both!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Although it <i>seems</i> stronger, it's not affecting either of you at all.  The nausea is abated, at least for the moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Suddenly, an arm still grasping a dagger gets <i>sucked</i> with great force under the flotsam.  You both peer into a multi-chambered eye for a moment.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It blinks.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Then dives away, further down in the pit.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Frenchy nods in agreement and they head back to the junction. They inform Maouelue and Stenchy about what they just saw and indicate that they should head the other way for now.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>The group trudges on together up the NE way. Once again, Dieter and Frenchy take the scout role, but now Dieter produces a flame to light their way.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>It is a very large flame this time.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group takes the NE path, moving quietly...  except for Stenchy.  The wizard, who is constantly checking behind himself for fear of being snuck up on, spies something <i>slithering</i> and skittering down the path behind them.   (Survival check from whomever is leading the group - Frenchy, right?)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The path continues on.  As the group continues on,  they see a three-foot diameter hole in the ceiling of the tunnel, directly above them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter raises his flame to the hole to try and light it up a bit.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter is...  yep, he's fairly sure this hole is naturally occurring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Nonplussed, the group moves on. Maouelue mutters something about snakes.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The party moves onward.  (Good movie by the way, if you haven't checked it out!)  </p><p>The path continues on...  ten feet, twenty more...  Fifty more...  The skittering keeps pace with Maouelue, staying just at the edge of his vision.  He sees it crawling on the ground.  Then loses it for a time.  The party can hear the sounds of little claws hitting the stones in the floor, clicking together... unnerving them.  Until, suddenly...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The tunnel opens into a strange cavern.  The walls arch overhead quickly, almost at a 90 degree angle.  Sounds echo frightfully here.  There are noises of dripping and the slight splashing of water.  The torch illuminates the area, but only just.  The room seems to be getting bigger and bigger the farther they go.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing is no longer behind you.  And hasn't been for some time, you realize.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue beckons the group to put out their lights and to stay by the door while he scouts out the room with his darkvision. He proceeds along the left wall.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The wizard looks around as the other three huddle and shine lights around the area.  They are in a large open space.  The three without darkvision are not able to see the walls, but they can hear noises bouncing all around the cavern.  </p><p></p><p>Maouelue searches the area, looks up the wall and sees...  a grub-like creature clinging to the wall about twenty feet up.  It's about the length of a grown human's leg, and about a foot in diameter.  It is looking at Maouelue.  Strands of spittle hang from its maw.  As the liquid hits the floor of the cave, it hisses.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue tilts his head and hisses back. His hands start to crackle then turn bluish white. He raises them and points them directly at the maw!</i></p></div>

This creature is at least three times as large as the thing they just massacred.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>As the thing crawls down the wall, it pauses at the body of it smaller member.  It lets out a screech and a cry that rattle the walls, then stares at the wizard.  (The roar will be one action, they each have two attacks they can make.)</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue is the first to recover his wits and gestures for calm. The party, slightly crestfallen, obliges.

<div class="character-0"><p><i>Maouelue rests by the fire watching the flames. He relaxes his mind into its usual meditative sequence, going over the events of the day, then casting them toward the stars in his mind's eye. Here in the dark cavern, his memory of starlight is lifeblood. Life...he considers this a moment...his run ins with death... These musings form a blip in his usual steady trance. The scene of Briffo's burial blends with the stars. His song comes in and bends its drifting lines, tracing constellations. Now slowly a low hiss grows and distorts the glorious notes, a cruel laugh, darkness begins to set in. Then a flash of platinum blue sears the scene...there is only one constellation, burning radiantly wavering obscuring all else. An outline only visible in the relief of pure light begins to resolve...The vision of divine justice, of good, the king of dragons....Bahamut's form sears itself into the mind's eye. Maouelue is no longer controlling this meditation, this is something else...A silent voice in his head speaks. It says to him simply, "Life." Then the form turns and begins to alight back to the stars, the form now more visible in the new relief of darkness, the void of space feeling ever deeper than ere it has. As Bahamut set wing to space, the last fleeting glimpse before he took flight was dimmed only by a spectral Briffo, nestled in the crook of a wing, looking out over the vast expanse. He lifts a platinum lute and strikes a final chord, fleetingly winking back into Maouelue's eye. Then....it's all gone. The darkness of the abyss becomes the shadows of the cavern receding to the flickering flames of the fire. Maouelue comes to changed. He knows now in his heart he must use his power to bolster the forces of good and channel his power into life. He stands, a new radiance seems to emit from him, awe inspiring, yet distancing. This new strength seems to come at the cost of a certain kind of knowability, but not loyalty or honesty.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>This hunt for the Muhlen sisters is no longer a curiosity. It is a divine decree. Let the roots of evil be laid low for their treachery though the purification of the very soil to which it has taken root.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As he rises, he looks at the frenchmen, their new brethren. He holds a hand to each of their shoulders and says a prayer. He traces the mark of Bahamut in his minds eye as they disappear back into the ether...back into the mirror. A sad, yet pure knowing sets over him as he begins to don the now-empty plate mail. He affixes the Giantess Bracers and Frostbitten Helm. He sets his scabbard to his waist and picks up Frenchy's dagger. Digging around in his pack for a moment, he pulls out a stray piece of silver ore that must have settled to the bottom during their journey. Holding it over the fire with the dagger, he warms the metal and it drinks in the firelight. Bringing it back out, he sets it on the Shield of Disruption and begins shaping it into a draconic form. A symbol for his new devotion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he's melding the silver, the feeling of a human hand rests on his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue turns, expecting to see the stranger from the fight before.  Instead, he sees a blond man, ethereal, radiating powerfully bright aura around him.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Your faith will be your reward.  Know that I will be here, watching over you.  When you most need me, look to the East, look for your patron."</p><p>He touches your shoulder, sending radiant energy through the wizard's body.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he disappears, and Maouelue looks back to the shield, you sense the metal is different now.  On closer inspection...  the metal dragon is platinum.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>An ebullition of all proportions sears into the cavity in Maouelue's chest, swelling him from his very core outward. A divine pride and devotion seem to reinforce the very sinews of his being. He picks up the shield and slings it over his left arm. His fingers grip the hilt of the sword and he unsheathes it, holding it point upward directly between his eyes. He lets the firelight bend off the sharpened edges of his sword into the back of his mind. Then he stands his silent vigil over the camp.</p></div>
