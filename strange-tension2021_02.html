<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“I go to do this thing. None that would turn aside need follow me. You have all taken on more have your fair share thus far. I go to free these lands once and for all, so that we may have the realm at our back when we go to the citadel. None will be able to deny me should I do this thing.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage moves through picking up the trinkets from his last venture here. He gazes at the two swords, then turns to the guards. “If it would please the Queen, I shall take Midsummer and Midwinter to fulfill this deed.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The guards turn and say, "Nay, we cannot allow you to take up those, they have to be given by the Queen herself.  If you would like, we can send an envoy to ask the Queen for you?"</p><p></p><p>Daran shakes his head, and gets up to lean in to whisper in Maouelue's ear.  "This is a suicide mission.  I am not sure what was said, what was done, there are insane rumors going around.  It doesn't matter, though.  All of us could go with you - the entire gods-damned army could attack, and it would still be the same.  This is madness, Maouelue.  The Queen could even deny you aid after you come back successful...  and that is a big if.  Are you sure this is the best course of action?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"How can man or elf be sure of anything in this w- <i>these</i> worlds Daran? What <i>isn't</i> madness?</p><p></p><p>Here, for the first time in ages have I felt rest; it was but false. The <i>best course</i>, you say? No friend, it is not. But, it will keep us in the Queen's good graces and out of the realm's wroth for now. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is well. I have seen him through Lanrion. He is well attended, and I have no fear we shall meet again. Something here is a part of this and whilst we are here, it is our duty to attend to it.  </p><p></p><p>I do not ask any of you to follow me blindly into death. But I do ask you hinder me not."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran looks at Maouelue.  He lower's his head in thought.  Bellatrix comes over to give Maouelue her unspoken support.  </p><p>"I will not hinder you.  I will be behind you.  I brought you here, what happens to you all is partly my doing."  He lifts his head, saying, "Faen nha."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao takes up the guard’s offer to inquire after the swords, then goes back into his stoic posture.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Bellatrix pats the wizards back.  Daran sits back in his chair.  Benna wanders through the armory quietly.  Time passes.  Eventually, Daran stands and starts going through his gear and adding armor and weaponry.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Sorry for Maouleue’a epic mood swings lately!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, I think it makes a lot of sense.  He's in a strange place, where he thought one thing was going to happen. I threw a huge curve ball at you/him, and things happened as they did.  I hope you're not too pissed about coming out of left field with a new mission!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I’m gonna zip through this part a bit though i think.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao secures the trinkets he had previously spied in the armory and sets about looking for a good eladrin longbow and quiver of arrows.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(We can fast forward through the armaments.  Just put in what you want in your DND Beyond, and make sure to !update.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<p>Lumao offers around a few trinkets to the group, having reoutfitted himself. His Amulet of Health he offers to Bellatrix, the Mace of Reduction he passes to Daran.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A splint mail he proffers to any who would take it</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>A ring of fire resistance he hands to Benna</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The time passes slowly, especially in the silence.  Soon, boots are heard outside the hall.  Jelentrianna and two more plate-garbed summer eladrin sway in.  She marches over to a main table in the room, sets out a few scroll cases, then turns to face the group.  "Please continue to arm yourselves.  When you all are ready, we'll go over the plans for the raid on the opposition's main keep."</p><p>(Daran's got some good armor, he picked up a couple things, too.  Bellatrix and Benna aren't proficient with that armor.  Or any, for that matter!  Witches!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Word! I'll keep the armor, they can take the trinkets/mace...or not!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran takes the mace, and clips it on his belt.  Maouelue sees two gleaming scimitars replace his others.  He also has a newer longbow with golden-fletched arrows.  He was eyeing a cloak as well.  Bellatrix and Benna both take the items, Bellatrix gives a small smile in return.</p>

<p>(I dig some shopping episodes, too!  As a player, I really haven't had much opportunity to get gear and stuff.   One day... 😉)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(the churn is real)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Thanks for giving me dope items all the time)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Aye.  The Queen tells me you are to make a direct incursion on the Queen of Darkness's keep itself.  The goal is to relieve her of the black crystal and bring it, and her, back to Astrazalian.  This," she takes a deep breath, "is a difficult task.  Some may even say it is impossible.  Militarily, I would say it so with all of our army at the front door.  That being said, a small number would be best to infiltrate and take down the enemy from within.  Not to mention, regardless of whether you succeed or not, your names are already written into legend.  No one has even dared attempt what you four are about to.  Stories go, Queen Titania herself approached the front gates once.  She was able to spirit away after the ground was scorched where she had stood.  So...  know that you have the entire seelie people behind you.  What you do..."  She bows her head for a moment.  She then raises her eyes to Maouelue, who can see the emotion in them.  "We are very appreciative.  I'm good at being a solider.  But it would be good to just be an eladrin again.  Thank you, lord wizard."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You're more than welcome, sir!  You're playing inquisitively.  Besides lore and other fun stuff, I figure items are pretty cool!  You make good use of them, too.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Jelentrianna, may this be the moment that I stop letting my past rule my future, and the moment I make true my place among your people, in whatever way may be."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She smiles and nods.  "This...  would definitely cement that, I should say!"  She laughs, and her honor guard chuckle as well.   The tension felt only moments before seems to drift away, as steam on a cool breeze.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao allows himself a small chuckle with the group, but keeps his eyes on the captain.</p>

<p>"So, the best we can tell, the enemy keep is...  interred.  Like Mag Tureah, which is the fomorian stronghold, the Queen's keep is well underground in the Feydark.  Since we've never had people go into or come out of the place, we're planning blind here.  The only solid piece of information we have is that there are portals into the keep from a few specific areas around the Feywild.  First, there is said to be a portal at the center of the Maze of Fathaghn.  The dryad Fathaghn is said to have gone into the ground, that she hasn't been seen for some time.  More than likely, no one's been stupid enough to go looking for her.  The second place is the tallest spire in the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  You would have to face the Pale Prince along with extreme cold to best this test.  Lastly, Shinaelestra, or the Fading City, was once to be the Queen of Air and Darkness's birthright.  As a former Spring Eladrin, she was to rule there and bring a new era of peace and prosperity.  It is now a desolate, abandoned ruin.  With it being so close to both the Wild North and Vor Thomil, who knows what has run of the place now.  I can say, with a fair bit of certainty, that the keep can be found through the portals at any of these locations."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"We'd like to provide ground support, but the best I can give you right now, with the other raid happening, is a squadron of five long-range bowmen.  Depending on where you go, they could give you ground cover in the case of something large right away.   Where would your group like to go?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"We go to the Fortress of Frozen Tears."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks around with an icy stare that almost begs someone to challenge this assertion.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>They all look strangely at the stare from Maouelue.  The Captain breaks the awkward silence.  "Ah...  very well, lord wizard.  You should look through our cold-weather gear, then.  Right this way."  She leads the group to a small alcove with cabinetry with eladrin made cold clothing.  As you all start parsing through, Daran leans in closer to Maouelue.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Bellatrix and I should be fine, but...  what if I sent Benna back home, eh?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Do as you see fit brother."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He nods, hesitantly.  Then goes over to whisper with Benna.</p>

<p>Benna laughs at him and goes back to clothes shopping.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>When the team is set, their packs readied, Captain Jelentrianna ushers Maouelue back to the scrolls.  She unfurls one, giving him the coordinates for the Fortress.  The next she unfurls, it has a general layout of the tower.  Lastly, the third has a writ of passage from the Queen, so transportation should not be an issue.  After all is packaged back up, the eladrin and her honor guard salute Maouelue's team, bowing at the waist.  "Go with courage and honor, lord wizard.  We look forward to seeing you all back when the job is finished."  With that, she turns on her heels and marches out.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(work and stuff happened)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries, brother!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"I look forward to this meeting as well. We will see you on the other side of the battle."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>With that, the troupe picks up and begins to head out to their destiny, for better or worse.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The guards throughout the palace are at attention, saluting the team as the they exit the crystalline Castle of Starlight.  As the constant autumnal sun shines on the courtyard, a garrison of troops are waiting in salute there as well.  Four horses are waiting to take the group to the Eastern Docks.  Once there, they board a small ship that will take them down a tributary and into the Vale of Long Night.  From there, as the ship deposits the team in the freezing cold, the group looks over the barren wasteland of snow and ice.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Distance, like time in the Feywild, is amorphous.  Malleable.  From the map, looks like the destination is over a mountain range.  Maouelue sees a range to the north and one to the south.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The mage surveys the frozen lands, the iciness fields matching that of his heart. There is comfort in this, frost, the one thing he could always count on. He surveys the lands looking for a low point in the ranges ahead of their destination in readiness to push off.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(There's going to be some mechanics here for the trudge and travel.  I've got dinner for the kids, though, so I'll be afk but we can get this ramped up asap!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Cool cool!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Travel through snow, ice, blizzards, avalanches, and over mountainous terrain is all really rough.  Going with a smaller group is good, but it's still treacherous.  Plus, there are a ton of animals the group has never seen before.  You all have a bunch of items that are useful, but the biggest thing through here is going to be the survival trait.  Bellatrix and Benna are no good here, but Daran is an expert.  You can choose whether to aid him - to have him roll advantage - or the two of you take singular rolls.  Sometimes it'll be a group survival or stealth or perception check.  Other times, it'll be the leader/s.  First, give me a d20 roll.  1=d100+25; 2-5=d100+20; 6-10=d75+15; 11-15=d50+10; 16-19=d25+5; 20=d20)</p>

<p>Daran is worried, preoccupied by making sure the group members are okay.  Bellatrix sees them first, and tugs at Maouelue's arm.  There are huge, black creatures wandering over the snowy plain, near the mountain pass.  She tells the wizard that they are enormous, it's not just a perspective.  They are gaunt, maybe around 30 feet tall.  Wisps of black smoke are whipping off of the creatures.</p>

<p>The climb starts getting rockier, steeper.  Daran leads as best he can, making sure the creatures are at a distance and that they're putting the right feet forward.  However, it is taking longer than expected.  Everyone, now, is suffering a point of exhaustion.  Couple that with the fact that the group has not slept in quite a while, this might be difficult going.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<p>Benna sits shivering in the snow-packed trail.  The rest spy a cave a little further on.  Daran, sizing up the group's situation, says to Maouelue, "Might be best to take a breather.  There's a cave up ahead there.  You and I can check it out, maybe make camp there for a longer rest?"</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao looks over at the sisters, who are looking rough and bitterly cold. </p><p></p><p>“To the cave!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“But for the sake of the gods, keep a lookout for anything that moves!”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran covers Maouelue's flank, the women huddle against the mount wall, trying to escape the bitter wind.  Maouelue does not see anything at this point, the cave looks to be deep, more than 20ft deep at least.  There are no animals visible. </p><p></p><p>As the pair continue to make their way to the mouth of the cave, nothing else presents itself, but the inside is more visible now.   Darkness shadows the back of the hole in the mountain.  The ceilings are covered in sharp icicles, which start ten feet overhead.  The snow goes in a few feet, but the eddies of wind keep the rest of the cave snow free.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>With a good look, and with Maouelue's dark vision, he can see pretty far into the cave.  It goes on a distance, the space opening up well past the limit of his vision.  Bones litter the floor.  Small bones, none look to be bigger than a human hand bone.  At least of what he can see.  (What would you like to do?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Do we happen to have a map for this greater area on R20?)</p>

<p>(Whilst I consider my choices 😉 Fairly busy day/week of work here, but I'm trying to keep up! I want to do this more than that <i>other stuff</i> lol)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No, but I could get one up!  I hear you, but no worries sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Lumao asks the group to stand back by the entrance for a moment. He raises his hands toward the icicles hanging from the ceiling. He speaks a word of warmth...</p><p></p><p>"Let the fires of our hearts heat the hearth in this humble home."</p><p></p><p>As he says this, a blast of flames flows outward toward the ceiling, melting the ice into falling drops of water. Then, as the water falls and pools, he speaks a word of shaping and cooling, sending two large planes of water to either side of the group. He holds the makeshift walls of water in place, then concentrates on freezing them in place, leaving just enough of a gap at the top of each for airflow.</p><p></p><p>With this complete, he magically sops up the remainder of the water from the ground and patches up the edges, securing them in place. He then invites the group to circle round and huddle in.</p>

(Just an fyi, I'm working with these rules for a 'focused attack' like this.  Basically, the base attack has to be +6 or better, and you would have to give up both attacks to get a benefit to your critical hit range.  So, basically, I'll crit 16-20.  If I crit, and if I put him under 0 points, I'll get to 'call my shot'.  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/3rd-party-feats/rogue-genius-games/combat-feats/focused-attack-combat/)

<p>(For elves, at least!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok need to do a general time of day/weather status update. We may take to the cave fully and am wondering about maybe piling up some snow boulders in front of the entrance to obfuscate it. Also, directionally, if we were to head straight through the back of the cave, is that the direction of the fortress?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(It's the Feywild, so it's always that middle-to-end of the day, sunset, etc.  Never changes.  There is a little light coming in from the mouth of the cave, but it doesn't reach as far as the back of the cave.  It's considered in darkness for mechanics.  There is a bunch of snow outside.  If you all take a few hours to gather it, you could pile up enough to semi-close the gap.  We could do group or aided survival checks for both the direction of the cave and the success of finding a way through, if it even goes through to the other side, etc.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(cool cool. gonna be in and out here now for awhile.)</p>

<p>(Coo.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I think we want to camp out here for a while and get our bearings in the relative safety. Perhaps we cool up some yeti meat to get proper fed before moving on. Mao will switch to the bat and they will all do a short rest/eat. They’ll spend some time stacking up the “door/barricade” and Daran will scout the outside of the cave a bit to see what else is around and what direction he can tell from outside. Mao will be using the bat to inspect in the outcropping a bit and checking for hidden passages, knocking on the walls to hear echoes etc.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group sets to work on the yetis and their flying companions.  After a time, and after setting up a nice big fire, they're able to set a few pelts together, curing in the heat.  Plus, several steaks are on a spit, fat dripping and sizzling on the cookfire.</p><p></p><p>Daran sets out to check the walls, then the outside, then scouts up ahead for other animals and the general lay of the land.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>He gets a pretty good sense on the direction.  If they were to continue in the direction of the gash, they would be going toward the Fortress.  Generally, and that's if the cavern moves straight.  Once down there, it would be hard to tell the direction.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The hawk-turned-bat squeeks then hops/flies down the small shaft.  Almost 80 ft further in, the crack opens up into a fairly large cavern.  The bat can only see midway through, mostly inky blackness and stalactites greet him.  However, he is able to glimpse, just as he gets to the edge of the telepathic connection, a floor several dozen feet below, with scattered pools of water around.  He detected no movement or life in the pass or the cavern.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"This would be the time to have a Druid around...", Maouelue says, reminiscing about the <i>many</i> times Dieter would transform randomly into a spider or aught else and bugger off into a cavern. He allows himself a small chuckle that, surprisingly, offers a glimpse of an inner heat that more than matches that of the fire. The investigator notes this curiously and files it away as he considers how best to approach the situation without a shapeshifter in company.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran wrestles the steaks from the fire, carving them up for everyone to try.  (Con saves!)</p>

<p>Armor and tight spaces aren't made for each other.  Thirty feet in, there is an odd outcropping, and with Maouelue's bulk, he just isn't able to squeeze past it.  His bat can see a bit more of the area - and it shows more of the same.  Bigger cavern, stalactites and stalagmites.  Smaller pools here and there formed from water dripping down from above.  Nothing moving or shaking.  The pass is at least structurally sound, there doesn't seem to be any rock debris falling, or scree anywhere.</p>

<p>(Ha I was gonna ask you the same. Can you clarify “There is enough clearance for people to move down the wall and land at the bottom”?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Just meaning there are no obstacles for people moving down the wall.  There are no outcroppings or burrs, no spikes sticking out, anything like that.  Just a sheer drop to t he floor, 35ft down.  Survival check to see if there are footholds or if you'll need to tie a rope.)</p>

<p>Nasty creatures, some only a foot long, others up to three feet.  Scrawny, nearly skin and bone, they all look ravenous, but are extremely dazed by the gem's light and do no come closer to the group than twenty feet outside of the dim light range, 60ft from the gem.</p>

<p>When the group looks around the cavern, they hear water dripping, can actually hear water moving somewhere in the distance.  The light doesn't shine into the edges, but as the four carefully traverse the ground, they can map out an irregular circular, nearly spherical, cave.  Almost directly opposite from the cracked pass, there is another crevasse, this one is big enough to fit two people side-by-side.  It is also hewn from the rock by water; a small stream meanders through the middle of this passage, downward, farther into the solid rock.  Just in front of this cavern, Maouelue sees something glinting in the gem-light.  A couple things, actually.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The remains of a makeshift campsite is present.  There is a metallic banner or pennant, ripped to ribbons, reflecting the light of the gem.  There is also a backpack leaning against a rock nearby.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue checks around for clues as to how recently this campsite was occupied.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(at first i was afraid i was petrified...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The campsite is quite old.  There is a name sewn into the top flap of the pack.  It is Rick.  There is nothing in there except a single fork.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>With a silent word, he sends Fammy the Bat flying deeper into the crevasse in front of them while taking note of the direction of the water’s flow.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The water is flowing down the route. but it only takes up a small potion of the passage floor.  Fammy is able to see the twists and turns, cut-backs and occasional drops up to the length of the telepathic bond.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue snatches Rick’s fork and begins to tread into the primal cavern.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Turning back a moment he zips up current and falls to his knees. He picks up Rick’s stash, then dangles it from one arm as he heads back into the gap in the walls of the cave.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Keep an eye out for mudrats.”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“And watch your footwear in here. It’s getting wet.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Everyone's head is on a swivel as the progress into the passage.  Daran is in the rear, checking for flankers.  And mudrats.  (Perception checks, please!)</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The metal mage finds that, the further he goes into the tunnel, the hotter it is getting.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Soon, there is a branch that backtracks and adds another stream going downward.  There are sections that have a few feet drops, there are areas that meander, seemingly cutting back.  The whole time, though, the group has been walking with the stream, always downhill.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Finally, the passage opens up wider to a 20x20 tunnel.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A hundred feet further down the path, the crew hears sound of rushing water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Some caves these!”</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Fammy flies ahead to check it out.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The end of the tunnel looks out over an irregularly shaped cavern, this time with a much larger drop.  Several openings throughout the area have water pouring into a massive pool on the bottom of the cave.  Fammy senses a few things in the water, but can't make out what they are.  Plus, there is steam rising up from the water below.  Which is different, because the water you've been travelling with has been cold.  Stalactites and stalagmites abound in the system, and just before the telepathy gives out, Fammy can see the cave actually dog-legs into a completely new section further on.  It could go on for quite a bit further in that direction, and the rushing water seems to get louder in that direction, too.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Gonna hit pause there tonight, sir.  Fun stuff!  Hope you like the easter eggs!  Might have an ask for you for the Monday sesh, but I'll email you, just in case.  Have a good one, brother!)</p>

<p>Maouleue looks at the group, offering his hand and focusing on Bella.</p><p></p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She looks at Maouelue.  "What, do you have a magic carpet?"</p><p>(Roll20 is up!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>He takes her hand and shouts to the others, “Jump!!!”, then leaping off and pulling Bella with him!</p>

<p>Benna cackles all the way down, Bellatrix is laughing, completely trusting and at ease with Maouelue's leadership.  Daran... is along for the ride.  A small <i>splash</i> happens as the four enter the water.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue begins to manipulate the water, pushing and pulling it up and around, dissing out the depth and assessing the footing underneath. He begins to make a large icy path over to the closest “island” rock in the center, aiming to connect as many as he can to traverse the area.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(or maybe better yet, we make an ice boat)</p>

<p>(Can't have an ice boat without ice oars!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Fammy senses something coming to the surface, or trying to, but can't see anything specific.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Fammy also sees four different sections that branch off from the main section.  The dog-leg to the right has some small rapids.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I want to cast find familiar again to change the form of Fammy. Might have to ritual it and burn some stuff? Can I get a ruling?)</p>

<p>“Keep an eye out while I take care of something here.” Maouelue takes to his ritual preparation changing Fammy into a large toad that plops down into the water as soon as this is complete.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the ice boat floats to the next nearest opening, N, the group sees that stirring of water get bigger and bigger, almost becoming a whirlpool right in front of them.  Just as the churning waves turn the route in front of the pack into very choppy rapids, a being rears out from the depths!</p>

<p>Rushing water sprays up as the first rapid is met.  All of the sudden, the speed picks up as if the boat is pushed by a giant hand.  The drop is precipitous, and rocks jut out at all angles.  The light-orb hovers just in front of Maouelue, giving him a spine-chilling view of the tunnel they're about to traverse.  It is ever descending.

<p>The metal mage’s rapid ride has risen his inner ions. He charges, glowing a more golden shade of white and blue than his usual translucent pallor.

<p>The two remaining eels yip and yap and swim away from impending death, deeper into the water.  Even though the water is moving at a quick pace, the farther and farther along the new tunnel the group moves, the quieter and quieter it gets.  It's also getting quite hot.  Stifling, even.  Daran runs a hand through the water, and shrugs.  "Water's not making this place heat up.  Wonder where it's coming from?"</p><p></p><p>Benna is shifting through her vests and comes out with three small spines.  "Here," she says to the others.

<p>Rushing water continues to bring the four companions through the insides of the mountain.  They look all around, and it hits them suddenly and at the same time - there is no sound.  It continues eerily like this for a few minutes until, very faintly, the elves start to hear a small sound.  At this point it is just white noise.  The boat continues on.  (Perception check, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(This is awesome...  😃)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The sound is still hazy, but it sounds like rushing water.  Only this is much larger, a lot of water...  And, simultaneously, Maouelue feels the pace quicken, and begin to move downhill.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Up ahead, at the edge of his view, there is a dropoff - all he can see is the top of the tunnel angle down.  Just off to the left, right before the drop, is a small alcove.  If he's deft enough, he could nose the boat in and stop the momentum.  Or, they could go right for the fall.  What does Maouelue want to do?</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Bottoms up!”, He charges the boat right for the falls.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(I imagine this next part as a cut scene; a mix of insane roller-coaster meets water-park ride, all in the semi-dark!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran's face tightens and the sisters hold hands as Maouelue steers the ice boat into the course where he hears rushing water.  The tunnel does in fact fall away, into a 45 degree drop, and the water, already quick, picks up a fever pace.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Centuries of water making it's way though these tunnels has carved out an interesting tunnel.  Although straight in certain areas, where it does turn, it is often violent and jarring to the boat riders.  The first few are gentle enough, if surprising in the dark.  The next few, however, make it hard for Maouelue to keep the boat straight.  It knocks into the edges and threatens to tip!  (Dex save!)</p>

<p>The boat lists right, then left.  A massive drop and turn to the right, spiraling down, catches the sisters off guard.  Daran secures Benna, Maouelue and Bellatrix hunker down for the swirling fall.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The tunnel spirals for another hundred feet down, then levels off again, but the pace is still intense.  Their ball of light is trying to keep up with them, to illuminate the group's way.  But it might not be needed much longer.   At the end of this very long tunnel is now an opening.  The outline of which looks lit with red flame.  There are no off-shoots, no branches.  A few rock spires stick out treacherously.  The sound of the rushing water is all-encompassing now.  The group can see the twenty foot wide exit to whatever waits below only a hundred feet in front of them...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Rushing water careens the boat towards the opening...  (Anything you want to do before you go over the edge?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(just white knuckling it all the way down and in.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Whoo!!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>As the boat crests the edge, Maouelue gets a view of a massive cavern, strewn with rock crevasses, lava flows, and a huge waterway interconnecting everything.  A variety of beasts can be heard growling throughout, and, just as he's about to plummet over the lip, he sees an <i>enormous</i> being in the center, carrying a greatclub over a shoulder.  Then, they plummet...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The ice boat descends into the cavern, a multitude of other waterfalls mix and add to the chaos.  Judging the distance down at near 200 feet, Maouelue and his crew brace for impact into the fluid below.  Fluid, not water.  He sees, as it comes up quickly, that it's a brownish, greenish soup.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>It's difficult to breathe now as the air in this portion of the mountain is steeped in lava ash and soot.  The boat melts on the way down.  The four are plunged into the depths of the fluid and find that they cannot see right in front of them.  It's a struggle to get back to the surface as the liquid is very thick, viscous.  (Dex saves, please!)</p>

<p>Maouelue breaks the water, followed closely by Bellatrix and Benna.  Immediately, they're all caught in a current that pulls them farther down.  Daran is able to land clear of the current, and he breaks the surface... without the others.  He tries to check on the others, but he can't see more than a couple inches in front of him.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks around at the frozen bloody bits of hellhound sinew scattering the area. He chuckles slightly and looks around at his companions. "Well, that was nine hells of a run! Glad to be warm and safe at last! Perhaps we should take a rest and gather ourselves here."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The crew looks for a secure place to rest, and they try to attune to which direction the heat seems to originate from.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group is able to remove themselves from the disgusting stew.  Once they move the dead hound bodies, they are able to find a sufficient corner to rest in, decently secure in their safety.  (Short/long rest?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks with concern at the sisters. Bella having lost her magic and Benna...well, Benna was anyone’s guess, but though she seemed to enjoy the rapids ride, she certainly could do with some down time. Maouelue looks at Daran. “Let us set up camp again here for the...whatever time it is. Daran, could you take the first watch while I recover my mana?”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran says, "Aye," and starts setting up a perimeter.  He then sets to investigating the hounds for choice bits.  Benna helps.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A few hours later, at the end of the wizard's meditation, he opens his eyes to find a small cookfire set with a choice stew simmering in a pot.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Daran, you king! This looks delicious! Thank you friend. I will take your watch whenever you would like."</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue looks over and check on the sisters' comfort before digging in to the stew.</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>As the mage eats, he looks around considering their options. While he had not intended their entrance into the cave to be permanent decision, there was no doubting the heat here was a welcome relief to the blizzard that raged upon them outside. Now to find a way out...or further in...</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Con save, please!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Benna giggles and says, "You like-a tha stew, eh!"</p>

<h3>Avrae – Avrae</h3>


<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A fire starts in your belly.  Benna says, "To be honest, it's more of a gruel than a stew.  But it get's the job done!"  <i>Cackle, cackle</i></p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Mmm! Mmhmmm....”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Take one point of GERD damage.  The Hell Hounds are not agreeing with you.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><i>A song of ass and fire...</i>, broods Maouelue.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Speaking of jobs, I seem to have gotten us into quite the pickle here. Let us consider our options.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Assessing the lake again, aside from the holes in the wall letting in the water streams, there is an alcove due E in the water, one N of the camp, and another small walkway S of the group.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>“Let’s take a look at this Southern route first.”</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>Daran takes his reverie while the group eats and rests.  Bellatrix gets her full compliment of sleep, but wakes up still feeling groggy.  Maybe due to the surroundings?  The camp is broken down quickly and the foursome make to scout the southern pass.  Maouelue can feel, as they all head that direction, that the air does seem to get warmer this direction.  (Marching order?)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue conjures his familiar again as they pack their things.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p><span style='color: black; background: black;'>"Fly on ahead. Scout out the southern passage."</span></p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The bird flies 50 feet south, hitting a fork in the craggy tunnel.  It is familiar to the waterways above, complete with rocky outcroppings throughout.  The floor, however, is fairly well worn and the ceilings are 25 feet high in places.  At the intersection, there is a tunnel going NW, one going SW and yet another moving SE.  All water has completely evaporated here as it is stiflingly hot.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The crew follows and takes the NW route. The bird scouts ahead as they move.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Sorry, dude.  I'll get it picked up more tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Dude, it is nooooo peeeeeezy 🙂 I am in the middle of-wait-no-already-sold my condo and am looking for a new house before April 21. 😛 Work is bannnannnnas too. We can take it at a medium pace. 😛 )</p>

<p>Maouelue sees his conjured familiar in the corner of the cave, knocked out but otherwise fine.  There are three tunnels branching out W, one in the middle is glowing with a faint purple and yellow light.</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Gonna pause there brother. Good stuff! Ttys!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Good night, sir!)</p>

<h3>Russell – Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Maouelue takes a moment to wake up his familiar then they all proceed into the middle passage together.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 – GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The group steps over the carcasses of the snake and newts, some still astride their mounts.  The ice from the metallicomets melts in puddles around them.  There is an eerie purple and yellow glow coming from the tunnel.  As the group moves closer, they can see it is coming from a bulbous mushroom standing just over three feet tall, and almost five feet wide from the cap.  There are a few yellow fungi in the S side of the room, emitting a fainter glow.  Every now and again, the yellow mushrooms tuck down close to the ground then <i>puff</i> up, releasing spores into the air.</p>
