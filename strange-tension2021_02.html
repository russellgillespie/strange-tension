<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-0"><p>“I go to do this thing. None that would turn aside need follow me. You have all taken on more have your fair share thus far. I go to free these lands once and for all, so that we may have the realm at our back when we go to the citadel. None will be able to deny me should I do this thing.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage moves through picking up the trinkets from his last venture here. He gazes at the two swords, then turns to the guards. “If it would please the Queen, I shall take Midsummer and Midwinter to fulfill this deed.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guards turn and say, "Nay, we cannot allow you to take up those, they have to be given by the Queen herself.  If you would like, we can send an envoy to ask the Queen for you?"</p><p></p><p>Daran shakes his head, and gets up to lean in to whisper in Maouelue's ear.  "This is a suicide mission.  I am not sure what was said, what was done, there are insane rumors going around.  It doesn't matter, though.  All of us could go with you - the entire gods-damned army could attack, and it would still be the same.  This is madness, Maouelue.  The Queen could even deny you aid after you come back successful...  and that is a big if.  Are you sure this is the best course of action?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"How can man or elf be sure of anything in this w- <i>these</i> worlds Daran? What <i>isn't</i> madness?</p><p></p><p>Here, for the first time in ages have I felt rest; it was but false. The <i>best course</i>, you say? No friend, it is not. But, it will keep us in the Queen's good graces and out of the realm's wroth for now. </p><p></p><p>Dieter is well. I have seen him through Lanrion. He is well attended, and I have no fear we shall meet again. Something here is a part of this and whilst we are here, it is our duty to attend to it.  </p><p></p><p>I do not ask any of you to follow me blindly into death. But I do ask you hinder me not."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran looks at Maouelue.  He lower's his head in thought.  Bellatrix comes over to give Maouelue her unspoken support.  </p><p>"I will not hinder you.  I will be behind you.  I brought you here, what happens to you all is partly my doing."  He lifts his head, saying, "Faen nha."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao takes up the guard’s offer to inquire after the swords, then goes back into his stoic posture.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix pats the wizards back.  Daran sits back in his chair.  Benna wanders through the armory quietly.  Time passes.  Eventually, Daran stands and starts going through his gear and adding armor and weaponry.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao secures the trinkets he had previously spied in the armory and sets about looking for a good eladrin longbow and quiver of arrows.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao offers around a few trinkets to the group, having reoutfitted himself. His Amulet of Health he offers to Bellatrix, the Mace of Reduction he passes to Daran.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A splint mail he proffers to any who would take it</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>A ring of fire resistance he hands to Benna</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The time passes slowly, especially in the silence.  Soon, boots are heard outside the hall.  Jelentrianna and two more plate-garbed summer eladrin sway in.  She marches over to a main table in the room, sets out a few scroll cases, then turns to face the group.  "Please continue to arm yourselves.  When you all are ready, we'll go over the plans for the raid on the opposition's main keep."</p><p>(Daran's got some good armor, he picked up a couple things, too.  Bellatrix and Benna aren't proficient with that armor.  Or any, for that matter!  Witches!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran takes the mace, and clips it on his belt.  Maouelue sees two gleaming scimitars replace his others.  He also has a newer longbow with golden-fletched arrows.  He was eyeing a cloak as well.  Bellatrix and Benna both take the items, Bellatrix gives a small smile in return.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>Updated and saved data for Daran Edermath!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We are ready. Let us delay no longer."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Aye.  The Queen tells me you are to make a direct incursion on the Queen of Darkness's keep itself.  The goal is to relieve her of the black crystal and bring it, and her, back to Astrazalian.  This," she takes a deep breath, "is a difficult task.  Some may even say it is impossible.  Militarily, I would say it so with all of our army at the front door.  That being said, a small number would be best to infiltrate and take down the enemy from within.  Not to mention, regardless of whether you succeed or not, your names are already written into legend.  No one has even dared attempt what you four are about to.  Stories go, Queen Titania herself approached the front gates once.  She was able to spirit away after the ground was scorched where she had stood.  So...  know that you have the entire seelie people behind you.  What you do..."  She bows her head for a moment.  She then raises her eyes to Maouelue, who can see the emotion in them.  "We are very appreciative.  I'm good at being a solider.  But it would be good to just be an eladrin again.  Thank you, lord wizard."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Jelentrianna, may this be the moment that I stop letting my past rule my future, and the moment I make true my place among your people, in whatever way may be."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She smiles and nods.  "This...  would definitely cement that, I should say!"  She laughs, and her honor guard chuckle as well.   The tension felt only moments before seems to drift away, as steam on a cool breeze.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao allows himself a small chuckle with the group, but keeps his eyes on the captain.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Before they leave the armory, Lumao takes a pot shot with his new bow, testing its nock and feathers.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"So, the best we can tell, the enemy keep is...  interred.  Like Mag Tureah, which is the fomorian stronghold, the Queen's keep is well underground in the Feydark.  Since we've never had people go into or come out of the place, we're planning blind here.  The only solid piece of information we have is that there are portals into the keep from a few specific areas around the Feywild.  First, there is said to be a portal at the center of the Maze of Fathaghn.  The dryad Fathaghn is said to have gone into the ground, that she hasn't been seen for some time.  More than likely, no one's been stupid enough to go looking for her.  The second place is the tallest spire in the Fortress of Frozen Tears.  You would have to face the Pale Prince along with extreme cold to best this test.  Lastly, Shinaelestra, or the Fading City, was once to be the Queen of Air and Darkness's birthright.  As a former Spring Eladrin, she was to rule there and bring a new era of peace and prosperity.  It is now a desolate, abandoned ruin.  With it being so close to both the Wild North and Vor Thomil, who knows what has run of the place now.  I can say, with a fair bit of certainty, that the keep can be found through the portals at any of these locations."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"We'd like to provide ground support, but the best I can give you right now, with the other raid happening, is a squadron of five long-range bowmen.  Depending on where you go, they could give you ground cover in the case of something large right away.   Where would your group like to go?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We go to the Fortress of Frozen Tears."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao looks around with an icy stare that almost begs someone to challenge this assertion.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They all look strangely at the stare from Maouelue.  The Captain breaks the awkward silence.  "Ah...  very well, lord wizard.  You should look through our cold-weather gear, then.  Right this way."  She leads the group to a small alcove with cabinetry with eladrin made cold clothing.  As you all start parsing through, Daran leans in closer to Maouelue.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Bellatrix and I should be fine, but...  what if I sent Benna back home, eh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Do as you see fit brother."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He nods, hesitantly.  Then goes over to whisper with Benna.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna laughs at him and goes back to clothes shopping.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>When the team is set, their packs readied, Captain Jelentrianna ushers Maouelue back to the scrolls.  She unfurls one, giving him the coordinates for the Fortress.  The next she unfurls, it has a general layout of the tower.  Lastly, the third has a writ of passage from the Queen, so transportation should not be an issue.  After all is packaged back up, the eladrin and her honor guard salute Maouelue's team, bowing at the waist.  "Go with courage and honor, lord wizard.  We look forward to seeing you all back when the job is finished."  With that, she turns on her heels and marches out.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"I look forward to this meeting as well. We will see you on the other side of the battle."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>With that, the troupe picks up and begins to head out to their destiny, for better or worse.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The guards throughout the palace are at attention, saluting the team as the they exit the crystalline Castle of Starlight.  As the constant autumnal sun shines on the courtyard, a garrison of troops are waiting in salute there as well.  Four horses are waiting to take the group to the Eastern Docks.  Once there, they board a small ship that will take them down a tributary and into the Vale of Long Night.  From there, as the ship deposits the team in the freezing cold, the group looks over the barren wasteland of snow and ice.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Distance, like time in the Feywild, is amorphous.  Malleable.  From the map, looks like the destination is over a mountain range.  Maouelue sees a range to the north and one to the south.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The mage surveys the frozen lands, the iciness fields matching that of his heart. There is comfort in this, frost, the one thing he could always count on. He surveys the lands looking for a low point in the ranges ahead of their destination in readiness to push off.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The troupe starts as Maouelue picks a route towards the southern mountain range.  Tall peaks look daunting as they trudge through low snow drifts.   The group bundles up more and more as they walk on.  (Survival checks and Constitution saves from everyone.  Feel free to roll for the sisters, they're straight d20s.)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The clouds from the north break in a monumental snow storm.  Suddenly, the group is surrounded by insane winds and they're having a hard time even seeing each other.  Daran yells back to the crew, "We should hunker down, stay put until the storm blows over."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Well said Master Daran. Let us look for cover.”</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Feet away is a copse of coniferous trees, providing safety and warmth from the pushing storm.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The four huddle together under the thick boughs of a couple tightly knit together evergreen trees.  The wind whips, but the four travelers are safe and nestled quite snugly in their hideaway.  A couple hours later, the winds abate a touch.  A couple more hours after that , both the wind and the snow back off and it is safe to travel again.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Daran is worried, preoccupied by making sure the group members are okay.  Bellatrix sees them first, and tugs at Maouelue's arm.  There are huge, black creatures wandering over the snowy plain, near the mountain pass.  She tells the wizard that they are enormous, it's not just a perspective.  They are gaunt, maybe around 30 feet tall.  Wisps of black smoke are whipping off of the creatures.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Benna sits shivering in the snow-packed trail.  The rest spy a cave a little further on.  Daran, sizing up the group's situation, says to Maouelue, "Might be best to take a breather.  There's a cave up ahead there.  You and I can check it out, maybe make camp there for a longer rest?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao looks over at the sisters, who are looking rough and bitterly cold. </p><p></p><p>“To the cave!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“But for the sake of the gods, keep a lookout for anything that moves!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Let me take the lead on this one!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran covers Maouelue's flank, the women huddle against the mount wall, trying to escape the bitter wind.  Maouelue does not see anything at this point, the cave looks to be deep, more than 20ft deep at least.  There are no animals visible. </p><p></p><p>As the pair continue to make their way to the mouth of the cave, nothing else presents itself, but the inside is more visible now.   Darkness shadows the back of the hole in the mountain.  The ceilings are covered in sharp icicles, which start ten feet overhead.  The snow goes in a few feet, but the eddies of wind keep the rest of the cave snow free.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>With a good look, and with Maouelue's dark vision, he can see pretty far into the cave.  It goes on a distance, the space opening up well past the limit of his vision.  Bones litter the floor.  Small bones, none look to be bigger than a human hand bone.  At least of what he can see.  (What would you like to do?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao asks the group to stand back by the entrance for a moment. He raises his hands toward the icicles hanging from the ceiling. He speaks a word of warmth...</p><p></p><p>"Let the fires of our hearts heat the hearth in this humble home."</p><p></p><p>As he says this, a blast of flames flows outward toward the ceiling, melting the ice into falling drops of water. Then, as the water falls and pools, he speaks a word of shaping and cooling, sending two large planes of water to either side of the group. He holds the makeshift walls of water in place, then concentrates on freezing them in place, leaving just enough of a gap at the top of each for airflow.</p><p></p><p>With this complete, he magically sops up the remainder of the water from the ground and patches up the edges, securing them in place. He then invites the group to circle round and huddle in.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Lumao sits, stroking his trusty hawk, as he slips into his reverie, oddly distant. Daran sees that the sisters are situated for a rest before taking up the watch.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A couple hours into the watch, Daran hears a scratching on the other side of the ice-wall.  The side that faces further into the mountain.  He can see movement on the other side as well.  Something big and hulking is moving back and forth along the ice wall...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He decides not to wake anyone just yet and try to surmise what the beast is.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A second white blur comes along and scratches the ice as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>And then, a third...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran hides, trying not to move a muscle for fear the beasts might see him though the wall.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's only about an hour left in Maouelue's reverie.  If they can just hold out...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The scratches turn to pounding.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are low roars and some commotion.  Maouelue hears these murmurings and random poundings as he finishes his reverie.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He sees Daran, motionless, kneeling with hands on scimitars, ready to jump into action.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Silently coming back into the immediate consciousness, the mage directs the hawk silently to fly up and try to peer through the air hole at the top of the back ice wall, trying to get a better view on the beasts beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are four creatures there.  Maouelue sees through the hawks eyes...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue tries to get Daran's attention and whispers ever so softly, "I will take the watch from here brother. Please take your rest while I monitor these yeti."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I will try.  If you need me, I'll be ready to fight."  He slowly crosses over to lean against the cave wall, sitting cross-legged, hands still on scimitars.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"<i>Quiet!</i>"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>One leaves, the others are starting to lose interest as well.  (One more?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The two are still hanging around, but not pounding or scratching...  (Un mas?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The leader starts clawing and scratching, taking some small gouges out of the ice.  The second does nothing.  (Last one!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The hawk-turned-bat squeeks then hops/flies down the small shaft.  Almost 80 ft further in, the crack opens up into a fairly large cavern.  The bat can only see midway through, mostly inky blackness and stalactites greet him.  However, he is able to glimpse, just as he gets to the edge of the telepathic connection, a floor several dozen feet below, with scattered pools of water around.  He detected no movement or life in the pass or the cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"This would be the time to have a Druid around...", Maouelue says, reminiscing about the <i>many</i> times Dieter would transform randomly into a spider or aught else and bugger off into a cavern.

The investigator notes this curiously and files it away as he considers how best to approach the situation without a shapeshifter in company.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Armor and tight spaces aren't made for each other.  Thirty feet in, there is an odd outcropping, and with Maouelue's bulk, he just isn't able to squeeze past it.  His bat can see a bit more of the area - and it shows more of the same.  Bigger cavern, stalactites and stalagmites.  Smaller pools here and there formed from water dripping down from above.  Nothing moving or shaking.  The pass is at least structurally sound, there doesn't seem to be any rock debris falling, or scree anywhere.</p></div>

Almost directly opposite from the cracked pass, there is another crevasse, this one is big enough to fit two people side-by-side.  It is also hewn from the rock by water; a small stream meanders through the middle of this passage, downward, farther into the solid rock.  Just in front of this cavern, Maouelue sees something glinting in the gem-light.  A couple things, actually.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The remains of a makeshift campsite is present.  There is a metallic banner or pennant, ripped to ribbons, reflecting the light of the gem.  There is also a backpack leaning against a rock nearby.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue snatches Rick’s fork and begins to tread into the primal cavern.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Turning back a moment he zips up current and falls to his knees. He picks up Rick’s stash, then dangles it from one arm as he heads back into the gap in the walls of the cave.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep an eye out for mudrats.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“And watch your footwear in here. It’s getting wet.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Everyone's head is on a swivel as the progress into the passage.  Daran is in the rear, checking for flankers.  And mudrats.  (Perception checks, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The metal mage finds that, the further he goes into the tunnel, the hotter it is getting.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Soon, there is a branch that backtracks and adds another stream going downward.  There are sections that have a few feet drops, there are areas that meander, seemingly cutting back.  The whole time, though, the group has been walking with the stream, always downhill.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Finally, the passage opens up wider to a 20x20 tunnel.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A hundred feet further down the path, the crew hears sound of rushing water.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Some caves these!”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Fammy flies ahead to check it out.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The end of the tunnel looks out over an irregularly shaped cavern, this time with a much larger drop.  Several openings throughout the area have water pouring into a massive pool on the bottom of the cave.  Fammy senses a few things in the water, but can't make out what they are.  Plus, there is steam rising up from the water below.  Which is different, because the water you've been travelling with has been cold.  Stalactites and stalagmites abound in the system, and just before the telepathy gives out, Fammy can see the cave actually dog-legs into a completely new section further on.  It could go on for quite a bit further in that direction, and the rushing water seems to get louder in that direction, too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouleue looks at the group, offering his hand and focusing on Bella.</p><p></p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She looks at Maouelue.  "What, do you have a magic carpet?"</p><p>(Roll20 is up!)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes her hand and shouts to the others, “Jump!!!”, then leaping off and pulling Bella with him!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Benna cackles all the way down, Bellatrix is laughing, completely trusting and at ease with Maouelue's leadership.  Daran... is along for the ride.  A small <i>splash</i> happens as the four enter the water.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue begins to manipulate the water, pushing and pulling it up and around, dissing out the depth and assessing the footing underneath. He begins to make a large icy path over to the closest “island” rock in the center, aiming to connect as many as he can to traverse the area.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Each member of the quartet try and reach the bottom, but cannot and have to tread water.  Daran takes a chance and tries to swim down, but he stops fairly quickly as the heat gets uncomfortable almost right away.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are small fish in the water, here and there.  Nothing dangerous, though.  There are also a couple spaces to the east and north where the water is being churned up.  It doesn't look the fish are the reason being the tumult.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They paddle around West as it is the most leftward of all directions. “Let us see what we can of this tumult.”</p><p></p><p><i>Fammy, seek!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The fey bat flies directly overhead the churning spots in the water, trying to make out shapes below, floating across in multiple passes at varying heights.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fammy senses something coming to the surface, or trying to, but can't see anything specific.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Fammy also sees four different sections that branch off from the main section.  The dog-leg to the right has some small rapids.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Keep an eye out while I take care of something here.” Maouelue takes to his ritual preparation changing Fammy into a large toad that plops down into the water as soon as this is complete.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran sets up with a bow and nocks it, just in case.  The sisters gather their things in the boat and keep a watch as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the bats turns toad, it hops in the water and goes to check on the disturbances.  All it notices are waves in the water, sometimes moving against the eddies and currents, sometimes with.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Sorry everyone, I guess it was nothing, but at least we know that now.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s move before this boat gives out. Follow the heat.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They paddle around looking at each passage out and feeling for temperature.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the ice boat floats to the next nearest opening, N, the group sees that stirring of water get bigger and bigger, almost becoming a whirlpool right in front of them.  Just as the churning waves turn the route in front of the pack into very choppy rapids, a being rears out from the depths!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Towering almost to the top of the cavern, dozens of feet in the air, an elemental made of water towers above the party.  (Initiative?  Or did someone want to parlay?!)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The sisters are in awe.  Daran, ever stoic, raised just one eyebrow.  But the creature only has eyes (?) for the wizard.  (Persuasion check, please, with advantage!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The thing cocks its head (?) to the side and peers at the quartet in the boat.  It says, "Whssh, whhsssshhh, cssshh?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue whispers to the water around him and begins to conjure a likeness from it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>An icy blue-white representation of Bahamut now floats in the water in front of the boat. The budding frost mage preens in the gaze of the water elemental.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As you get closer to the rapids, the ice boat gets caught in a current and is being swept towards the rushing water!  (Strength checks again, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix puts her back into it this time, but as Maouelue is digging in, he's suddenly and hypnotically struck by her beauty.  The boat starts to spin, but gets no closer to the rapids.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Benna's eyes go wide and Bellatrix yells, "Brace yourselves!"  The ice boat starts down the raging rapids into the heart of the mountain!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ice boat is rotating fast.  As it's sucked towards the rapids and a decently steep first drop, the boat is either going to go down sideways, or right itself to going forward or backwards.  (The line-up is Maouelue, Bellatrix, Benna, and Daran, from front to back?)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the boat twists around, dips, dives, it rights itself and heads over the first set of rapids, thankfully with Maouelue in front, steering!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rushing water sprays up as the first rapid is met.  All of the sudden, the speed picks up as if the boat is pushed by a giant hand.  The drop is precipitous, and rocks jut out at all angles.  The light-orb hovers just in front of Maouelue, giving him a spine-chilling view of the tunnel they're about to traverse.  It is ever descending.  Untold numbers of rock spikes poke out from the walls and the water itself, almost as if the tunnel has teeth.  Benna starts giggling.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The boat plunges twenty feet down in an instant, and the group goes down a waterfall!</p></div>

They look all around, and it hits them suddenly and at the same time - there is no sound.  It continues eerily like this for a few minutes until, very faintly, the elves start to hear a small sound.  At this point it is just white noise.  The boat continues on.  (Perception check, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The sound is still hazy, but it sounds like rushing water.  Only this is much larger, a lot of water...  And, simultaneously, Maouelue feels the pace quicken, and begin to move downhill.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Up ahead, at the edge of his view, there is a dropoff - all he can see is the top of the tunnel angle down.  Just off to the left, right before the drop, is a small alcove.  If he's deft enough, he could nose the boat in and stop the momentum.  Or, they could go right for the fall.

<div class="character-1"><p>Centuries of water making it's way though these tunnels has carved out an interesting tunnel.  Although straight in certain areas, where it does turn, it is often violent and jarring to the boat riders.  The first few are gentle enough, if surprising in the dark.

Their ball of light is trying to keep up with them, to illuminate the group's way.  But it might not be needed much longer.   At the end of this very long tunnel is now an opening.  The outline of which looks lit with red flame.  There are no off-shoots, no branches.  A few rock spires stick out treacherously.  The sound of the rushing water is all-encompassing now.  The group can see the twenty foot wide exit to whatever waits below only a hundred feet in front of them...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Rushing water careens the boat towards the opening...  (Anything you want to do before you go over the edge?)</p></div>

Then, they plummet...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ice boat descends into the cavern, a multitude of other waterfalls mix and add to the chaos.  Judging the distance down at near 200 feet, Maouelue and his crew brace for impact into the fluid below.  Fluid, not water.  He sees, as it comes up quickly, that it's a brownish, greenish soup.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's difficult to breathe now as the air in this portion of the mountain is steeped in lava ash and soot.  The boat melts on the way down.  The four are plunged into the depths of the fluid and find that they cannot see right in front of them.  It's a struggle to get back to the surface as the liquid is very thick, viscous.  (Dex saves, please!)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue breaks the water, followed closely by Bellatrix and Benna.  Immediately, they're all caught in a current that pulls them farther down.  Daran is able to land clear of the current, and he breaks the surface... without the others.  He tries to check on the others, but he can't see more than a couple inches in front of him.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks around at the frozen bloody bits of hellhound sinew scattering the area. He chuckles slightly and looks around at his companions.

<div class="character-0"><p>The crew looks for a secure place to rest, and they try to attune to which direction the heat seems to originate from.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The group is able to remove themselves from the disgusting stew.  Once they move the dead hound bodies, they are able to find a sufficient corner to rest in, decently secure in their safety.  (Short/long rest?)</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue looks with concern at the sisters. Bella having lost her magic and Benna...well, Benna was anyone’s guess, but though she seemed to enjoy the rapids ride, she certainly could do with some down time. Maouelue looks at Daran. “Let us set up camp again here for the...whatever time it is. Daran, could you take the first watch while I recover my mana?”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran says, "Aye," and starts setting up a perimeter.  He then sets to investigating the hounds for choice bits.  Benna helps.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few hours later, at the end of the wizard's meditation, he opens his eyes to find a small cookfire set with a choice stew simmering in a pot.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Daran, you king! This looks delicious! Thank you friend. I will take your watch whenever you would like."</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>As the mage eats, he looks around considering their options. While he had not intended their entrance into the cave to be permanent decision, there was no doubting the heat here was a welcome relief to the blizzard that raged upon them outside.

<div class="character-1"><p>Benna giggles and says, "You like-a tha stew, eh!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A fire starts in your belly.  Benna says, "To be honest, it's more of a gruel than a stew.  But it get's the job done!"  <i>Cackle, cackle</i></p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Assessing the lake again, aside from the holes in the wall letting in the water streams, there is an alcove due E in the water, one N of the camp, and another small walkway S of the group.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Let’s take a look at this Southern route first.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Daran takes his reverie while the group eats and rests.  Bellatrix gets her full compliment of sleep, but wakes up still feeling groggy.  Maybe due to the surroundings?  The camp is broken down quickly and the foursome make to scout the southern pass.  Maouelue can feel, as they all head that direction, that the air does seem to get warmer this direction.

The floor, however, is fairly well worn and the ceilings are 25 feet high in places.  At the intersection, there is a tunnel going NW, one going SW and yet another moving SE.

There are a few yellow fungi in the S side of the room, emitting a fainter glow.  Every now and again, the yellow mushrooms tuck down close to the ground then <i>puff</i> up, releasing spores into the air.</p></div>
