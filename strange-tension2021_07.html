<h1>strange-tension</h1><div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The creatures look upon the image in awe, mouths agape, some drooling.  They stop what they're doing to watch the rock bards magically emerging from their hole in the wall.  A few sacks hit the floor, spilling their contents.  This breaks the creatures from their awestruck attention on the party, some start scrabbling to return the items back to the bags.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Prepare ye the way of the horde."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>Dieter gets into the mood of the thing.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few start to goggle at the group whilst the rest try to pack up their bags.  One does and quickly throws himself off of the edge of the pit, into the darkness below!</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Stay yourselves! Throw yourselves not into the Abyss! You may still redeem yourselves! Come look upon the horde and prosper!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A few more jump down the hole, but the rest patiently await your commands.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the last one drops down the hole, a few moments pass.  Then a rumbling from the bottom of the pit greets the party.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Oh dear, didn’t we deal with it properly?” Dieter posits aside to Jaecob.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Don't know, dont really care to find out, honestly.  Anything we need from this place?  If not...  I think I'm ready to find my asshole of a father."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>It had been quite a journey to find the treacherous patriarch. It would be a shame to deny Jaecob his destiny. </p><p></p><p>“Stand back and ye shall not be harmed!” </p><p></p><p>Dieter beckons Flayco and Shelli to move out before him as a grotesque honor guard, shooing away the remaining gawkers. </p><p></p><p>“Those with knowledge of these halls…step forth and be rewarded.”</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>They have no clue what you're saying, they're just reacting to the tone so far.  They look back and forth between themselves.  One of the ones that fled climbs back up, grabs a would be groupie, and pulls/throws it down the pit before it jumps in too.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Ugh, never mind.” Dieter walks out of the cloud and moves to the small door to the NNW, muttering about cretins and fools.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Perhaps his menagerie was quite large enough already.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door grates against the floor but the it opens fully.  Hallways stretch beyond the doorway, hooking around slightly to the right, where it opens into an alcove with two doors leading E.  One is ajar and Dieter can see the long open room with the banners beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes this corridor to be a hallway between the rooms they've already explored. He considers what they had been running from and continues down the hall, listening for traces of the band of thieves they had escaped.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The rest of the kobolds parachute (sans parachute) down the pit, the rumbling subsides as the foursome leave for better environs.  The hallways are dank and devoid of life.   It doesn't seem like anyone has been through here in decades, maybe even generations.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The doorway leads to the hall of banners, where Lord Muhlen introduced himself in all his ghostly form.   The only door that hasn't been tried is the E door.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>They go to there.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter inspects the door and tries to open it.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The door opens smoothly.  A small 20x20 room welcomes them.  A door stands in the NE wall.  Greasy ash and creosote is burned into the floor in front of another carcass of a tent, as in the other room with the purple gems.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter brings everyone inside and begins inspecting the room, moving quickly through to the other door.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bags Dieter finds are complete tatters, nothing usable for carrying.  There is, however, a strange area within the tent that catches Jaecob's attention.  He waves you over and shows you a depression in the wall, what would have been the back of the tent.  "Whatcha make of this.  Maybe another dragon egg den?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, let’s find out. We need more pieces to this puzzle.”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes a closer look.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter peers at the stone wall.  There does seem to be a seam in the wall.  One good push, maybe?...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He prods at it with the wave-blade end of his staff.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It feels like pushing into stone.  A couple prods into it, some small pebbles come loose and fall to the floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter picks up the stones and closes his eyes, whispering word of the waves waking the water walls.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He hurls three stones all together at the breach.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter throes a trio of stones at the depression, and all in one instant, there's an opening there.  A set of stairs greets the adventurers, but there is no light in the corridor beyond.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well well well...the mystery deepens."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Here, this will light the way." he says, descending the stairs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stairs open into a library of sorts.  The last one you were in was...  scary and had a carcass in it.  This one in <i>much</i> homier, with a couple nicely upholstered chairs, a few bookshelves, and a very large chest against the far wall.  There are doors on the N, E, and S walls, all wooden and fairly simple.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter moves about the room, looking for any traps and magical traces.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There are several magic things in the room, small explosions greet the druid as he casts the spell.  The chest is one, abjuration and evocation magic are attached.  A few books pop out at Dieter ranging from illusion to necromancy, and underneath the rug, a small ping of divination magic.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter raises a finger. “Move carefully in here… matter of fact, don’t move at all…”</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He kneels to sense at the magics beneath the rug first, sensing a trap.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>He lifts the rug, and...  sees a ring.  Silver, with small engravings of moons and stars on the sides, curving all around it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Hmm, what a curious object!” He runs his fingers over the runes.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The ring is cold to the touch, colder than the room or stones around it.  The inscription is less runic than astrological and aesthetic.  It has a heft to it as well.  (Arcana or identify spell for more info.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It feels like this ring will give you the possibility of casting a school of divinity spell.  Which one, you can't quite tell.  But there's some serious potential in this ring.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Jaecob, remind me prepare some identification magic next time we reset up. I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot of this kind of thing going forward."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Now picking up and stowing the ring, the dogged druid moves now toward the chest, now even warier with the pings of evocation around it. He steadies his hand and checks for any trapped mechanisms on it.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There is no physical lock, but it looks like there is an arcane lock on it.  A knock spell, dispell magic spell, or high arcana check will be able to break through it.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Hmm," shrugs Dieter. "I am not prepared. I'll just have to see what I can make of this."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Dieter probes, searching.  There is an aura of abjuration magic, protection magic.  It reminds him of Maouelue for a moment.  He recalls the mage's capability with magics, how adept he always was with all things magical.  As he probes, he wonders where his friend was at that moment.  A <i>click</i> brings him back from his reverie.  The large, ornate clasp on the front of the long chest flips open, the aura fades.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well fancy that..." <i>Was it just coincidence? Just as he was thinking of the arcane elf....</i> "Humphf...surely just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>He leans in now with thirsty intent on the contents.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>There's also 4,000 gold in rare gems.  Dieter sees four beautifully cut gems, various colors.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter turns now to the books. If he's being honest he was a bit tired of reading at that very moment, but he could not resist the pull of magic emanating from the various tomes. Securing the chest's contents, he now moves among the volumes, pulling the glowing books from their shelving, reading.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As Dieter picks through the volumes, most have a good solid layer of dust on them. he finds two that seems very well-worn but still quite well put together. At a quick glance, there's a broad book that tells of various evocation spells, and how to put them together properly (Reading the book will gain you one level 2 spell from the Evocation school).  The next book is black, with no markings on it.  The inside is blank.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"What a strange tome this is..." Dieter remarks, turning it's pages over in his hands and showing it to his entourage. "What do you lot make of it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob shrugs and falls into a chair, yawning widely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well, I'm sure we can prod it for answers along the way." He says, stowing it in his pack and beginning to read the first book with eagerness.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter now scans the rest of the room and begins moving to the doors in clockwise order starting at the West, turning their knobs and looking beyond into each space.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He moves then to the N door.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Just beyond, a storeroom with various sundry items.  Dried beans and fruit.  Some cured meats.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Before Dieter went into the N room, however, he did have to unlock the door.  It was locked from his side.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Come get your fill lads."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Jaecob bounds from the chair.  "Aye, lad!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He takes some time clearing out old rations and filling up his stores. Jaecob follows suit and several fists full of meat and fruit are sent to the snapping maws of Flayco and Shelli.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Flayco gobbles with relish.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>But he wishes it were brains.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Sweet, sweet brains.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Full now in belly and in bag, the move to the East room.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"We'll get you some brains soon Flay...." <i>Pathetic little whelp.</i></p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>This is nearly a mimic of the long hallway with banners that you all had just come from.  (If you want to enter this room, we'll have to pause.  I want to give you a good description and it leads to a few other rooms.)</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A 100 ft long hallway greets the foursome, mimicking the hall of banners you had just come from.  Although, there are no banners here.  Just tall, fluted columns with scratches at the bottom of them, as if from an animal...  or a pack of them.  The rest of the stonework also have these claw marks, they go up about five feet all around, but no higher.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter takes a closer looks at the scratching, being no stranger to clawing a wall or two himself. What kind of creatures might have done this?</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A myriad of doorways abound...  one on the N wall, 2 open hallways and 2 doors to the E, one door to W.  To the south, a shrine.  A bust of a massive illithid covers the entire S wall, bookended by two flaming torches.  A few lighted sconces send eerie shadows all around.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's strange, Dieter thinks they look like large wolf marks, maybe a dire wolf.  But there are a lot.  As he peers deeper, he sees dried blood between the cracks of the flagstones.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Come Flayco, let us gaze upon this shrine together.” He leads the young abomination over to admire the shrine.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>It's an abomination, but a nice likeness to Flayco.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco gawks.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>“Come, let’s keep moving.” Dieter says, leading them to the southeast passageway.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The hall turns sharply to the left twenty feet down, the light fades down this corridor.  Turning left, the party sees two doors on the right, one on the left, a hallway on the left near the end of the hallway, and an open doorway at the end, 75 feet away.  A flickering light can be seen beyond the doorway.</p></div>
