<h1>Strange Tension</h1><h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>!update</p>

<h3>Avrae ‚Äì Avrae</h3>
<p>Updated and saved data for Maouelue!</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Hey, great game last nigh. I can get back in on this today. It looks like my R20 map is all dark. Can you reveal when you have a mo?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Thanks, man!  I was kinda feeling a weird vibe, but I hope everyone was digging it.  Roll20 should be good, let me know if you're still getting the black-out.  There's a lot of the map that's not revealed, so it could be that.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Yeah, still getting the blackout. IDK about the vibe. Maybe? Perhaps it's just that we've been side questing and had to ramp back into this one. There was a lot of housekeeping to do, and it was high time we let that family get on with their lives.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(That was probably a big part of it!  I felt I was pushing a bit, too.  We'll see what happens next week, no worries.  Let me check something on Roll20...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(The section is revealed in the upper left portion of the screen.  It's about a quarter of the full map.  I tried reconnecting and refreshing.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Hmm, I'm still all dark. Sorry...)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(No worries.  Let me check a few more things.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Some of it I think is us reckoning with the mayhem we tend to leave in our wake. There's something about coming back and having it be a little uncanny that I think will be good for our characters' development.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Agreed.  The down time at the Wayside is always interesting, too!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I like that as Buxy and Lyz come back to the scene of the "breakup" that it's stirring up those old feelings.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(It would also be incredible sometime, say if we ever do the next film shoot, to do a live game. There's something about the audio delay that can get in the way of those moments where there's a lot of quippy interplay.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Totally agree - the audio lag is something I don't take into account often enough.  I try to leave space, but I know we're all hesitant to talk over each other.  Great point.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I thinks it's one of those things that can cause the quieter folks to miss their "chance" sometimes. I try to stay aware of it, but it can get pretty chaotic, especially since there is sort of a brewing uneasy feeling about the in-game group right now. I definitely feel that group and individual motivations are at odds in a finely poised way at the moment.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Makes sense.  I guess as long as I'm not completely fucking over the story line, everything will work itself out!)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(To clarify that last, as long as you guys are enjoying the story, things will work themselves out.)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(K, I think I fixed it?)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Refreshing the app now.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Hmm, it's still wonky. I'm not sure what's up. Do you want to test a different map just to see?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(How about now?)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I can see the FoFT now)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(Hmmm...  That's so strange.)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Is it maybe a dynamic lighting issue or something?)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Ok, i saw that change in real time but still dark)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(I can see that!)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>

<p>(OPness...)</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>(Also, how do you want to handle the level up in the middle of questing? Gain new spell slots? Reset them? HP?)</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>(You can roll for hp, but you'll have to rest to re-up.   Spells you can go ahead and use.  Since it's not milestone levelling, it's fine to use new stuff right away.)</p>

<p>As the trio make their way through the area, they keep hearing echoing voices, urgent and wary.  The fighting has called people - the question is, who?  The group makes its way out of the small passageway connecting the contoured stone block rooms to an open cave system surrounding the structure.  Just to the right of them, as they ease out into this new area, a wooden pen can be seen.  Within, a monstrous creature with an orange-amber carapace, a long tail with a viscous looking barb on the end of it, six spindly legs, and two massive clawed arms jutting from it's front.  It is using the claws to hack at the wooden beams of the pen, looking for a way out.  Farther into the cavern, more yeth hounds can be heard, yipping.  </p><p></p><p>Around the corner, movement...

<p>Looking at the foul arrow in her arm, Bellatrix winces, but holds firm. </p><p>"Oh, playing with missiles are we?.." She winks at Mao as the red of her armor begins to pulsate. The blood around her wound congeals weaving with dark black rivulets of magical force running to her fingertips and blasting outward in three short sharp shocks toward the perpetrator of her pain.</p>

<p>Maouelue clambers away safely.  Bellatrix dodges just in time to miss an errant claw swiping through the air.  As they both fall to the ground, more arrows come from the black space, followed by summer and spring eladrin, bows trained and firing on the beast hovering over the heroes.  In a few moments, the cavalry arrives in full, killing the animal and a familiar face greets the fallen Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>"Thought we'd lost you, Dragon Mage,"says a battered Jelentrianna, captain of the guard of the Summer Court.  "There's quite a few folk going to be happy to see you alive and well."  She offers a hand to Maouelue and Bellatrix.  </p><p></p><p>"Only the two of you left?  What of the older woman and the ranger?"</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Well met Jelentrianna! A sight for sore...and cold eyes indeed! The lady Benna is recovering her strength around the corner, praise the Platinum. Our good friend Daran however... he is clouded from my sight. It seems he has faded, if not gone entirely.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"A fair tale we have to regale you with though to be sure! What of the assault, what of the dark Queen?"</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Well met and well found indeed!  The war goes well, it seems we've just breached the main hold.  I was hoping you could tell us more of the Queen of Air and Darkness - we have not been able to find her.  Our magics are clouded as to her whereabouts as well, so we had hoped to find her here.  If you're asking, I can only assume she's eluded you too.  No matter, we will scour this keep and then burn it to the ground!"  The contingent she's with yells heartily and fans out, scouting other corridors bending around.  A large group pass by into the heart of the stone rooms, searching and continuing the fight.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"Have you completed your tasks, Dragon Mage?  Or do you wish to go back to the Court?  Once there, we can debrief you more on the war efforts."</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"The Pale Prince has fallen. We were teleported here by means of an enormous chardalyn crystal as foretold. It would seem our intelligence has been our boon. I would have those with an eye for the arcane follow me to the chamber straightway."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"It will be done."  She gives a small bow, turns to the group of seelie eladrin streaming in.  Finding someone, she calls to them, brings them over and says, "Illafaera will assist you with your arcane needs.  She is has been instrumental in taking the keep back.  If you need any more aid, please don't hesitate to have a runner come find me.  It is good to see you both."  She gives a small smile, then jogs south, shouting more commands.</p><p></p><p>Standing demurely in front of the pair is a tall, willowy summer eladrin, bright gold skin shimmering in the pale light of the underground castle.  Her long blonde hair hangs loose, all the way down to her waist, but it is as thin and wispy as spider silk.  Her large golden eyes look upon Maouelue with a mix of wonder, awe, and resignation - the Dragon Mage is having a tough time reading her emotion.  She waits, swaying slightly, her white-gray robes wafting in an light breeze.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"Your radiance..." Maouelue says as he bows perhaps a little too grandiosely for Bellatrix's liking. She interjects with a poorly disguised cough of annoyance.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>"If you would, we have found one of the great chardalyn crystals that the Queen's champions have been using. I would have you investigate its arcana. Perhaps it could be of use to our cause..."</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>She bows her head, letting her lead you to the crystal.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A short walk, just past the creepy dog, the group meets around the chardalyn, which a few other eladrin have found as well.  All stare in awe at the massive crystal jutting from the center of the floor.  (Investigation, perception, and arcana checks, please!  Arcana with advantage, because of Illafaera.)</p>

<p>"It seems there are...  spells locked into this crystal," the blonde eladrin says, turning her over-large golden eyes upon Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the wizard takes his time to investigate the crystal, he notices a few very curious things.  First, it nearly mimics the one in the Pale Prince's throne room...  almost exactly.  Almost as if they were the same piece.  The floor does look torn away at the base of the object, and it does look as if the crystal was growing from beneath the keep itself.  There has been several protection charms cast on the chadralyn, mainly to bolster it's flimsy character.  A piece this large, though, could be very hale.  With the charms, it might be indestructible.  </p><p></p><p>There are several spells stored inside - teleportation, transmutation, communication, even a few divination spells.  There is one, however, which is strange.  As Maouelue peers deeper and deeper into the shard, he notices a light inside of it, beating as if it were a heart.</p>

A small, soft voice flits in and out of Maouelue's consciousness, saying, "Touch the crystal.  It will give you powers beyond your wildest dreams..."   Maouelue notices several others turning to one another, apparently hearing the voice as well.</p>

<p>Again, the overwhelming feeling on harming his fellow soldiers comes over him, but Maouelue is made of tougher stuff.  He shakes it off, and a small voice inside his head says, "Tut tut, you shouldn't be trying to <i>destroy</i> it...  You should be trying to <i>merge</i> with it.  Imagine the <i>power</i>!  Imagine how you would wield this artifact.  The entire Feywild would be at your mercy..."</p>

<p>Maouelue grimaces, feeling the urge toward the promise of power, but finds the calm impassive righteousness embodied by his patron, lord of dragons. </p><p></p><p><i>This is not for glory. This is not for impunity. This is for unity!</i></p>

<p>A few keep their feet, but half fall to the floor, knocked back by the unseen force.  Bellatrix falls, Maouelue does as well, both reaching for each other as the blast pushes them backwards onto the cold stone floor.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>A cruel laugh starts from the middle of the now shaking chardalyn crystal.  It quickly dies away as the ground rumbles, the shard shakes more violently.  Then, it starts contracting, pulling it's many flutes and spires downward and inward, becoming a smaller version of itself rapidly.</p>

<p>Cracked stone from the ceiling falls inward as the crystal retracts from the top of the room.  It quickly descend and recedes into the floor, where it disappears in a matter of seconds, leaving a gaping wound in the castle.  Everyone looks at each other.  The screaming is still happening.  People look from one to the other.  Maouelue and Bellatrix peer from eladrin to eladrin, trying to find the source of the cries.  The scream intensifies...  then they see her.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>All are backing away from Illafaera, who is holding her head with both hands, kneeling on the ground, and screaming so hard spittle and mucus are leaking from her head in heavy drops.  Maouelue realizes quickly that the woman could not possibly have any more breath in her body, yet the screaming continues.</p>

<p>(You're good!)</p><p>Maouelue, is his boundless feeling for his fellow being, reaches out and touches the elf wizard.  His mind splits, arcing down the center, then bifurcates into more, many more, until thousands of voices are in his head, screaming, crying, retching, whispering ill omens and even worse promises of murder, torture, death.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The small ball of negative light rises until it is above the group, with everyone watching.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The voices in Maouelue's mind quiet to a dull thudding ache.  The sreaming of Illafarea stops, she takes in a wheezing, wracking breath.  The voice of a woman - sweet and lilting, like cool water on a hot day - comes into the minds of all collected there.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>"You have not won.  You will never will.  To those who thought they destroyed my Pale Prince, you will have hell to pay.  We will make sure of that.  For those of you who took my keep and killed my pets and friends, you will die as they have.  Do you not know?  I am eternal.  You cannot kill me.  You cannot hope to best me.  Some will say I have run, fled in fear of my life.  I tell you now, that is not the truth.  As all know, the best way to preen a large group of people is to get them all to one place.  Then, you only need a way to kill a large number of people at one time.  Good thing I've known how to do that since I was a small girl.  Go to your rests with the knowledge that I am not killing the one I want.  Goodbye."</p>

<p>The vault is quiet, with the fire having gone out some time ago as Dieter's spell dropped.  The Druid awakes refreshed and alert.  Nothing is moving, only the breathing can be heard.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Coming to and frowning at the newfound crick in his neck, Dieter Deleter blinks open and awake. A powerful feeling of refreshment flows over him.  Sometimes when you finally allow yourself lay down after a long hard push, your body starts making the decisions for you. So it was now with the Druid, who wincing slightly as he attempts to arise, begins to reckon with all that has happened so far‚Ä¶</p><p>‚Ä¶and all that lies ahead.</p>

<p>The darkness had encompassed them after hours of reading and study.  The two humans went through a treasure trove of books and manuscripts, most all pertaining to the anatomy and physiology of  and their ilk.  There were three, however, in their perusal of the library/laboratory that stood out as unique.  </p><p></p><p>The first, a broad leather bound behemoth, was entitled "Elder Evils' Encyclopedia", with golden scoll-work on the front.  Some of it's pages were ripped and it looked to be, toward the end, complete nonsense.  As if someone went mad while writing it.  </p><p></p><p>The second, a neat volume titled "Those That Came Before; An Overview of Extinct Magical Traditions and What We Can Learn from Them" was mainly a collection of notes from a peculiar wizard, all tied together.  The thoughts were chaotic and tough to follow.  </p><p></p><p>Last, there was a story of fables.  One fable, in fact.  "The Lives and Lies of Aefir Nightseeker".  Jaecob had just begun to read this when he succumbed to sleep.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Curious and refreshed, Dieter reaches over to pick up the fables from Jaecob, taking care not to disturb his slumber. In his many harrowing years, the druid had learned well the power of waking oneself rather than being woken. He peruses the pages with interest. Aefir Nightseeker...that name has a familiar ring to it, he muses...</p>

<p>A good amount of lore can be found in the book.  Some of which was already known to Dieter, having grown up on the Sword Coast.  There is the tale of Nightseeker going through the trials and finding the Eye of Darkness; the story of him battling the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil;  tales of him and his brother traversing the planes, adventuring and making names for themselves.  Some of the book, the front page and several at the back, are written in a very strange script which gives Dieter some trouble (does Dieter speak sylvan?  If not, intelligence check to interpret).   </p><p></p><p>One story sticks out as being important, it is dogeared several times over almost to the point of losing the top corner of the page.  It begins as Aefir finds the Eye of Darkness.  He is visited soon after by two beings - one a massive, red skinned behemoth with curling horns on his head and goat legs.  Standing over 20 feet tall, he looked down upon the eladrin with severity.  The second, however, was another red skinned man, horns curling back from his head as well, but standing just as tall as Aefir, he did not intimidate the elf.  The behemoth, seeing he was not making a good impression on Aefir, ushered the smaller man to go forward.  The smaller man was dressed impeccably in simple peasant clothing, but had on a beautiful black riding cloak.  He doffed a wide brimmed hat with a large, garish feather in the brim, and bowed low to Aefir.  The red man's dark black hair whipping in a breeze, had a tracing of facial hair around his jawline and around his mouth, but everything was neat and trimmed - one would even say... perfect.  The man comes up from his bow smiling, white teeth glinting.  </p><p></p><p>The man goes on to explain that they were inquiring about the new item Aefir had just taken.  They didn't want it, they just wanted to know of the young elf's plans.</p>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The eladrin suggested that he would destroy it, or even return it to the gods.  The smaller man asked Aefir how much he knew about the item, to which the eladrin replied that he could not see into it's depths.  Yet, he knew it to be a powerful artifact.  The smaller red man smiled, informing the elf that he, and the bigger man, could let him know many hidden secrets of the item, if only he would allow them to view it.  At this time, Aeneir, the sage brother of Aefir, stepped in and warned the young warrior against divulging the item to unknown persons.  Aefir suggested that they would get farther with discovering what the artifact could do with help.  They might never find the true powers of the item without help.  Aeneir, as he was wont to do, bowed out of the conversation and allowed Aefir to do what he would, the choice was his to make.  </p><p></p><p>Mentally struggling, the young elf took a deep breath and nodded his head at the small red man.  A large smile came across the red man as the small item was placed on the ground between them.  Aefir bade them to instruct a to the ways of the artifact.  The small red man approached, eyes wide.  </p><p></p><p>As he reached out and touched the object, there was a bright flash and a deafening boom.  The eladrin raised his shield, covering himself and his brother.  The behemoth cried out in surprise.  When the dust settled, the artifact still stood on the ground, the behemoth was looking on the scene in awe.  The brothers were safe, however Aefir quickly dropped his shield as it was burning his arm.  The large, red skinned man turned and disappeared, leaving his laughter echoing after him.  The warrior eladrin took out his sword and prodded the shield, finally turning it over.  On the front was the face of the small red skinned man, surrounded by scenes of the utmost hell.  As the brothers watched more, the face was twisted and finally morphed into the rest of the background, leaving the shield a scary, horned mess of it's former self.</p>

<p>From what Dieter can tell, gleaning some words he might have heard Maouelue use, the front page is a description of the book, which heavily suggests these are just children's stories, nothing is to be taken literally.  The back pages, however, are some higher concept, philosophical writing about the nature of these folk stories and their possible truth.  Most are notes written by someone who has been trying to find the source of these fables.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>

<h3>SuoRess_1019 ‚Äì GM (Joe)</h3>
<p>The room is just as the group had found it - surgical table with rotting mind flayer on it, books and supplies everywhere.  There are a couple chests and cabinets around the room, all closed.  The doors to the vault have remained solid through their slumber.  The downside of that, though...  they're completely sound-proof.  Good for hiding.  Bad for knowing what's been happening on the other side of the wall...</p>

(Constitution saves for everyone, please!)</p><p></p><p>Inside are broken glass jars.  They used to house what look to be bits of flesh or maybe organs of some kind, but all have given way to decay.  Green slime and even a few mold patches cover the inside of the chest.</p><p></p><p>Jaecob goes to open a few more chests and drawers, finding more of the same, and some mundane items - quills, parchment, leather for binding, a wax sealer with a block of black sealing wax.  One of the drawers has a small coffer box containing 58 gold and 18 silver.</p>

<p>The others begin to stir as Dieter, lost in his thoughts, has begun to unwittingly read aloud.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>The waking grunts from the menagerie break his concentration and after a moment of confusion, he smiles warmly at the lot of them.</p>

"Jaecob, could you open the door a crack, slowly now...."

The man consents and moves over toward the stone doors and begins to push. Meanwhile, Dieter spits on his hands and begins rubbing slowly, now quicker and quicker as the moisture seems to expand and forms a thick cloud of fog surrounding them.

Jaecob: "Well that oughta cause a right scare to anyone on the other side, or least ways it should hide us a bit!" he jests as he puts his back into the proceedings of shoving aside the stone doors.

<p>The stone rolls smoothly away from the group, letting the fog escape into the pit room.  Sqeaks and squeals can be heard beyond the moving doors, along with a few <i>oohs</i> and <i>aahs</i>.  A low chittering is heard underneath the low din, and as the fog billows then starts to clear, miniature dragon-men are standing, staring at the newcomers from the portal in the wall.  (Nature check for what they are.  Does anyone speak undercommon by chance?)</p>

<p>They are, in fact, kobolds, but they're not exactly like the textbook variety.  These are paler, and they're not speaking draconic or common.</p>

<h3>Russell ‚Äì Harrison Phyre/Dieter Deleter</h3>
<p>Dieter produces a small flame and sets it at the back of the chamber so as to produce a backlight for the fog, making their entrance appear almost divine. Jaecob heaves again at the doors and Dieter steps out holding this bladestaff aloft with two hands in the air.</p>
