<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As the trio make their way through the area, they keep hearing echoing voices, urgent and wary.  The fighting has called people - the question is, who?  The group makes its way out of the small passageway connecting the contoured stone block rooms to an open cave system surrounding the structure.  Just to the right of them, as they ease out into this new area, a wooden pen can be seen.  Within, a monstrous creature with an orange-amber carapace, a long tail with a viscous looking barb on the end of it, six spindly legs, and two massive clawed arms jutting from it's front.  It is using the claws to hack at the wooden beams of the pen, looking for a way out.  Farther into the cavern, more yeth hounds can be heard, yipping.  </p><p></p><p>Around the corner, movement...  Then...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An arrow comes out of the area just beyond the pen, arcing at Maouelue!</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>A glistening reddish black shield forms around the witch’s skin, giving it an eerie sheen like that of fresh blood.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>She urges Benna to hide herself behind a statue or corner to avoid incoming arrows and Tucker herself behind her...battle-mage-archer-dragon-knight in shining armor.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>It is not your turn.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Two more arrows come out of the black space beyond the pen, arcing over the snapping behemoth inside.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An arrow just catches Bellatrix where the mage armor doesn't quite cover, doing some significant damage.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue moves forward and brings his hands together, a rime of frost forming on his hands. He shouts out, "How cool is cool?!?" The rime then seems to dissolve from his hands, creeping around the bow arm of the attacking archer.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Looking at the foul arrow in her arm, Bellatrix winces, but holds firm. </p><p>"Oh, playing with missiles are we?.." She winks at Mao as the red of her armor begins to pulsate. The blood around her wound congeals weaving with dark black rivulets of magical force running to her fingertips and blasting outward in three short sharp shocks toward the perpetrator of her pain.</p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue's fingertips glow again, but this time with a twinge of iridescent purple. His fingernails seem to grow out of the very tips of his gauntlets before four sleek bolts fly out and dart right at what seems to be a gate on the northwest side of the paddock, right next to the Unseelie! They ping one after another into the clasp...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The clasp and part of the gate and paddock <i>explode</i> inward, shards of metal and splinters of wood careen all around.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A shard catches one of the unseelie eladrin under his armor, and he yells out in pain.  The monster in the cage doesn't seem to notice his freedom has been granted... yet.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After the barrage of bolts, a small, bluish orb seems to trail like a comet in the wake, beaming toward the second archer.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue turns back to move around the corner and shouts back toward the paddock, "You're free! Freeeeee!!!!"</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The first runs farther down the tunnel, the second follow, but flings an arrow behind them.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The bow breaks in half, the unseelie hisses and runs.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>As he made his way up the tunnel, he fumbles and falls.  His friend tries to pick him up as he runs along, trying to pull him out of the tunnel.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Bellatrix is very much still focused on the large beast in her midst.  Maouelue, seeing the eladrin fall, hears from down the tunnel they were running,  the sound of more running feet - coming towards them.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue picks his head up, searching for the fallen eladrin, listening for the coming footsteps.  Suddenly, an arrow comes from the darkness beyond the fallen bodies, farther up the tunnel!</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The arrow arcs over Maouelue, over Bellatrix...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>...And lands in the middle of the creature's body, causing it to rise up and trash around wildly.</p><p>(Dex saves, please!)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Maouelue clambers away safely.  Bellatrix dodges just in time to miss an errant claw swiping through the air.  As they both fall to the ground, more arrows come from the black space, followed by summer and spring eladrin, bows trained and firing on the beast hovering over the heroes.  In a few moments, the cavalry arrives in full, killing the animal and a familiar face greets the fallen Maouelue.</p><p></p><p>"Thought we'd lost you, Dragon Mage,"says a battered Jelentrianna, captain of the guard of the Summer Court.  "There's quite a few folk going to be happy to see you alive and well."  She offers a hand to Maouelue and Bellatrix.  </p><p></p><p>"Only the two of you left?  What of the older woman and the ranger?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Well met Jelentrianna! A sight for sore...and cold eyes indeed! The lady Benna is recovering her strength around the corner, praise the Platinum. Our good friend Daran however... he is clouded from my sight. It seems he has faded, if not gone entirely.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"A fair tale we have to regale you with though to be sure! What of the assault, what of the dark Queen?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Well met and well found indeed!  The war goes well, it seems we've just breached the main hold.  I was hoping you could tell us more of the Queen of Air and Darkness - we have not been able to find her.  Our magics are clouded as to her whereabouts as well, so we had hoped to find her here.  If you're asking, I can only assume she's eluded you too.  No matter, we will scour this keep and then burn it to the ground!"  The contingent she's with yells heartily and fans out, scouting other corridors bending around.  A large group pass by into the heart of the stone rooms, searching and continuing the fight.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Have you completed your tasks, Dragon Mage?  Or do you wish to go back to the Court?  Once there, we can debrief you more on the war efforts."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"The Pale Prince has fallen. We were teleported here by means of an enormous chardalyn crystal as foretold. It would seem our intelligence has been our boon. I would have those with an eye for the arcane follow me to the chamber straightway."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It will be done."  She gives a small bow, turns to the group of seelie eladrin streaming in.  Finding someone, she calls to them, brings them over and says, "Illafaera will assist you with your arcane needs.  She is has been instrumental in taking the keep back.  If you need any more aid, please don't hesitate to have a runner come find me.  It is good to see you both."  She gives a small smile, then jogs south, shouting more commands.</p><p></p><p>Standing demurely in front of the pair is a tall, willowy summer eladrin, bright gold skin shimmering in the pale light of the underground castle.  Her long blonde hair hangs loose, all the way down to her waist, but it is as thin and wispy as spider silk.  Her large golden eyes look upon Maouelue with a mix of wonder, awe, and resignation - the Dragon Mage is having a tough time reading her emotion.  She waits, swaying slightly, her white-gray robes wafting in an light breeze.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Your radiance..." Maouelue says as he bows perhaps a little too grandiosely for Bellatrix's liking. She interjects with a poorly disguised cough of annoyance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"If you would, we have found one of the great chardalyn crystals that the Queen's champions have been using. I would have you investigate its arcana. Perhaps it could be of use to our cause..."</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She bows her head, letting her lead you to the crystal.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A short walk, just past the creepy dog, the group meets around the chardalyn, which a few other eladrin have found as well.  All stare in awe at the massive crystal jutting from the center of the floor.  (Investigation, perception, and arcana checks, please!  Arcana with advantage, because of Illafaera.)</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"It seems there are...  spells locked into this crystal," the blonde eladrin says, turning her over-large golden eyes upon Maouelue.  </p><p></p><p>As the wizard takes his time to investigate the crystal, he notices a few very curious things.  First, it nearly mimics the one in the Pale Prince's throne room...  almost exactly.  Almost as if they were the same piece.  The floor does look torn away at the base of the object, and it does look as if the crystal was growing from beneath the keep itself.  There has been several protection charms cast on the chadralyn, mainly to bolster it's flimsy character.  A piece this large, though, could be very hale.  With the charms, it might be indestructible.  </p><p></p><p>There are several spells stored inside - teleportation, transmutation, communication, even a few divination spells.  There is one, however, which is strange.  As Maouelue peers deeper and deeper into the shard, he notices a light inside of it, beating as if it were a heart.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Two of the soldier eladrin, who seem to be taken in a trance-like state, reach out to touch the shard.  A small, soft voice flits in and out of Maouelue's consciousness, saying, "Touch the crystal.  It will give you powers beyond your wildest dreams..."   Maouelue notices several others turning to one another, apparently hearing the voice as well.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"STAY YOUR HANDS!!! HEED NOT THIS SUCCUBUS' TREACHERY!!!"</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The soliders break out of their trance and stare at Maouelue, then each other, blankly.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Surely it could only be her...though there was this hag..." He takes a moment to recount his combat with the crone.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"Fascinating.  And she just...  disappeared?  Where could she have gone?  And what are we to do with this...   chardalyn, did you call it?"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Is there aught we can do to break the barriers? Have any of you any Dispel Magicks?"</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"I can, and at a fair level, but I'm not sure that would eliminate this...  problem.  I fear it is a more physical approach that we need."  She stares up at the crystal, it's topmost points piercing the ceiling.  Illafarea steps back, ushers others to do the same with a movement of her hand, and then points her hands toward the chardalyn crystal.  Her fingers start to shimmer, a spell is directed towards the shard.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room reverberates with the casting, causing a few to step back from the central figure in the room.  A blue-silver beam emanates from Illafaera, is thrown out at the shard... but nothing happens.   The crystal is not affected.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The Metal Mage mulls this over for what seems like a week, rifling through his bag, looking for anything that might be of assistance.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>As he is digging, his arms keep catching on things. He takes  a moment to remove and stow his archery armguards, rubbing his pale white wrists that seem to chafe in the air as they take their first breath in some time.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue thinks back to the scene at Vam's house, all gathered around the dark room, lit only by the hearth and their collective spirit. There they all stood, Vam, Heston, Bellatrix, Daran...</p><p></p><p>...around the equipment so ritually lain by the metallic martyr. </p><p></p><p><i>Maouelue scoffs a little a the memory of his grand proclamations, a trait he had yet to buck and would continue to grapple with for some time.</i></p><p></p><p>The strength of the giants was in there, the object of Lord Alezander's obsession. Was there strength in their union? Was it just Maouelue's inquisitors's spirt, his desire to be a part of the grand stories, his <i>need</i> to be special...?</p><p></p><p>It comes to him that if there was ever a moment to find out, to.... <i>try,</i> it was now. His hand groping over the myriad items and knicknacks concealed in the impossibly small and resolute Bag of Holding™️ his hands land upon a long forgotten set piece. <i>The Giantess Bracers.</i> How had he forgotten such a boon? He looks again at his pale wrists and scoffs again, this time with an almost teary pang of sadness and shame...</p><p></p><p><i>The thought of everything that happened since he last worn this item sets his mind racing. What trail of sadness, what scorched earth, what hubris lay in his wake? He remembers the reluctance in Daran's voice, the deep sadness overlooked by Maouelue's own impetuousness and selfish need to find his supposed place in the Feywild. The unheeded warnings of Lanrion, insinuating the folly of lust for loot and longing for elevation. The incident with the Queen...</i></p><p></p><p>It is almost too much for him to bear, his spirit fairly begins to break and his eyes close, shielding an icy floe of tears. </p><p></p><p>After a moment, something warm seems to softly touch the back of his neck, a warm radiance spreading now over the very fibers of his being. He reaches up with his uncovered hand to find the fragile, yet hardened fingers of his devoted companion, Bellatrix. His eyes open again and he sees the onlooking throng, awaiting his declaration...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>He inspires, a long, low, and deep breath.</i></p><p></p><p>Raising his right hand to meet Bellatrix's, he feels the warmth now enter another part of himself. The area of action.</p><p></p><p>As if from another world, he hears her voice, "Do not doubt yourself Lumao, not now, not here at the time of this great need of your people. You <i>were... are</i> chosen. Your time is here, now, and henceforth. Do not let the ghost of the past, fresh as they may be, dominate your spirit. Feel the warmth of my blood in yours. Know your place as a part of <i>both realms!</i></p><p></p><p>How did she know he needed to hear this at precisely this moment? I guess it's true what they say about becoming <i>One</i> with those you love...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thank you, love"</p><p></p><p>As he speaks, a blue white glow giving way to reddish gold pulsates from his hand onto hers and back again to himself, the pale white of his wrists regaining their flush and vigor. He knows now what he has to do.</p><p>[Guidance on self]</p><p></p><p>He takes now the items of Giant's lore, equipping himself once more in the full-metal regalia. Putting away his Eladrin relics, he now opts for strength, looking over his Bracers and Mace once again with a newfound appreciation. He takes time to let their magicks meld with the fortitude of his warming spirit.</p><p>[Attune]</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After some time, with a few restless coughs and murmurs from the gathered Eladrin, Maouelue stands at the full, his emblazoned shield radiant in the half-light.</p><p></p><p>"If a more physical approach is indeed needed, Illafarea, then let it be so!"</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He smashes the Giantess Bracers together, the surprised crowd taking several <i>giant steps</i> back!</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin back up, astonished.  A small smile comes to Illafaera's lips.   A strange sense of tension hangs in the air.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>May my luck be better than my track record with this...</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The mace glances off the crystal, narrowly missing an archer eladrin on the follow through.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>An urge take Maouelue...  but only momentarily.   He felt, for some odd reason, as if he should turn his mace on his fellow eladrin...  Thankfully, the feeling leaves as quickly as it comes.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He shakes it off, tries again...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"><p>That's not a valid save.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Again, the overwhelming feeling on harming his fellow soldiers comes over him, but Maouelue is made of tougher stuff.  He shakes it off, and a small voice inside his head says, "Tut tut, you shouldn't be trying to <i>destroy</i> it...  You should be trying to <i>merge</i> with it.  Imagine the <i>power</i>!  Imagine how you would wield this artifact.  The entire Feywild would be at your mercy..."</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Maouelue grimaces, feeling the urge toward the promise of power, but finds the calm impassive righteousness embodied by his patron, lord of dragons. </p><p></p><p><i>This is not for glory. This is not for impunity. This is for unity!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I will find the strength!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p><i>I will finish this fight!</i></p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Over and over the Metal Mage, majestically mirroring the chardalyn and himself back into infinitely smaller and smaller refractions, bashes the crystal, as if he is working out destroying more than just the object at hand. He sees himself looking back at himself looking back at himself looking back at himself...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>A few keep their feet, but half fall to the floor, knocked back by the unseen force.  Bellatrix falls, Maouelue does as well, both reaching for each other as the blast pushes them backwards onto the cold stone floor.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A cruel laugh starts from the middle of the now shaking chardalyn crystal.  It quickly dies away as the ground rumbles, the shard shakes more violently.  Then, it starts contracting, pulling it's many flutes and spires downward and inward, becoming a smaller version of itself rapidly.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>Cracked stone from the ceiling falls inward as the crystal retracts from the top of the room.  It quickly descend and recedes into the floor, where it disappears in a matter of seconds, leaving a gaping wound in the castle.  Everyone looks at each other.  The screaming is still happening.  People look from one to the other.  Maouelue and Bellatrix peer from eladrin to eladrin, trying to find the source of the cries.  The scream intensifies...  then they see her.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>All are backing away from Illafaera, who is holding her head with both hands, kneeling on the ground, and screaming so hard spittle and mucus are leaking from her head in heavy drops.  Maouelue realizes quickly that the woman could not possibly have any more breath in her body, yet the screaming continues.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He reaches out, trying to stabilize the tortured Illafaera...</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>She suddenly throws her head back as a small purple-black ball rises from the hole in front of the golden eladrin.  Like a black hole surrounded by wisps of purple lightning, the ball hovers...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>(You're good!)</p><p>Maouelue, is his boundless feeling for his fellow being, reaches out and touches the elf wizard.  His mind splits, arcing down the center, then bifurcates into more, many more, until thousands of voices are in his head, screaming, crying, retching, whispering ill omens and even worse promises of murder, torture, death.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The small ball of negative light rises until it is above the group, with everyone watching.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The voices in Maouelue's mind quiet to a dull thudding ache.  The sreaming of Illafarea stops, she takes in a wheezing, wracking breath.  The voice of a woman - sweet and lilting, like cool water on a hot day - comes into the minds of all collected there.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>"You have not won.  You will never will.  To those who thought they destroyed my Pale Prince, you will have hell to pay.  We will make sure of that.  For those of you who took my keep and killed my pets and friends, you will die as they have.  Do you not know?  I am eternal.  You cannot kill me.  You cannot hope to best me.  Some will say I have run, fled in fear of my life.  I tell you now, that is not the truth.  As all know, the best way to preen a large group of people is to get them all to one place.  Then, you only need a way to kill a large number of people at one time.  Good thing I've known how to do that since I was a small girl.  Go to your rests with the knowledge that I am not killing the one I want.  Goodbye."</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>Darkness surrounds the man as he awakes from a deep, <i>deep</i> slumber.  The small sounds of breathing, several things breath, can be heard in the cramped, damp room.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The vault is quiet, with the fire having gone out some time ago as Dieter's spell dropped.  The Druid awakes refreshed and alert.  Nothing is moving, only the breathing can be heard.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Coming to and frowning at the newfound crick in his neck, Dieter Deleter blinks open and awake. A powerful feeling of refreshment flows over him.  Sometimes when you finally allow yourself lay down after a long hard push, your body starts making the decisions for you. So it was now with the Druid, who wincing slightly as he attempts to arise, begins to reckon with all that has happened so far…</p><p>…and all that lies ahead.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>He looks over at the others, his weird new brood of ragtag braun, schlurp, and hop, now in the winter hours of their repose. Lord knows what devilish things await them on this never-ending day-night in the Sunless Citadel. </p><p></p><p>The shapeshifter’s hand idly runs over a frail page of parchment and he draws a breath. He takes a moment now  to recall his readings, as he is reminded of their matters, or at least those he had perused before succumbing to capitulation.</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>The darkness had encompassed them after hours of reading and study.  The two humans went through a treasure trove of books and manuscripts, most all pertaining to the anatomy and physiology of  and their ilk.  There were three, however, in their perusal of the library/laboratory that stood out as unique.  </p><p></p><p>The first, a broad leather bound behemoth, was entitled "Elder Evils' Encyclopedia", with golden scoll-work on the front.  Some of it's pages were ripped and it looked to be, toward the end, complete nonsense.  As if someone went mad while writing it.  </p><p></p><p>The second, a neat volume titled "Those That Came Before; An Overview of Extinct Magical Traditions and What We Can Learn from Them" was mainly a collection of notes from a peculiar wizard, all tied together.  The thoughts were chaotic and tough to follow.  </p><p></p><p>Last, there was a story of fables.  One fable, in fact.  "The Lives and Lies of Aefir Nightseeker".  Jaecob had just begun to read this when he succumbed to sleep.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Curious and refreshed, Dieter reaches over to pick up the fables from Jaecob, taking care not to disturb his slumber. In his many harrowing years, the druid had learned well the power of waking oneself rather than being woken. He peruses the pages with interest. Aefir Nightseeker...that name has a familiar ring to it, he muses...</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>A good amount of lore can be found in the book.  Some of which was already known to Dieter, having grown up on the Sword Coast.  There is the tale of Nightseeker going through the trials and finding the Eye of Darkness; the story of him battling the Shadow Dragon of Mhaor'isel Ghaatiil;  tales of him and his brother traversing the planes, adventuring and making names for themselves.  Some of the book, the front page and several at the back, are written in a very strange script which gives Dieter some trouble (does Dieter speak sylvan?  If not, intelligence check to interpret).   </p><p></p><p>One story sticks out as being important, it is dogeared several times over almost to the point of losing the top corner of the page.  It begins as Aefir finds the Eye of Darkness.  He is visited soon after by two beings - one a massive, red skinned behemoth with curling horns on his head and goat legs.  Standing over 20 feet tall, he looked down upon the eladrin with severity.  The second, however, was another red skinned man, horns curling back from his head as well, but standing just as tall as Aefir, he did not intimidate the elf.  The behemoth, seeing he was not making a good impression on Aefir, ushered the smaller man to go forward.  The smaller man was dressed impeccably in simple peasant clothing, but had on a beautiful black riding cloak.  He doffed a wide brimmed hat with a large, garish feather in the brim, and bowed low to Aefir.  The red man's dark black hair whipping in a breeze, had a tracing of facial hair around his jawline and around his mouth, but everything was neat and trimmed - one would even say... perfect.  The man comes up from his bow smiling, white teeth glinting.  </p><p></p><p>The man goes on to explain that they were inquiring about the new item Aefir had just taken.  They didn't want it, they just wanted to know of the young elf's plans.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The eladrin suggested that he would destroy it, or even return it to the gods.  The smaller man asked Aefir how much he knew about the item, to which the eladrin replied that he could not see into it's depths.  Yet, he knew it to be a powerful artifact.  The smaller red man smiled, informing the elf that he, and the bigger man, could let him know many hidden secrets of the item, if only he would allow them to view it.  At this time, Aeneir, the sage brother of Aefir, stepped in and warned the young warrior against divulging the item to unknown persons.  Aefir suggested that they would get farther with discovering what the artifact could do with help.  They might never find the true powers of the item without help.  Aeneir, as he was wont to do, bowed out of the conversation and allowed Aefir to do what he would, the choice was his to make.  </p><p></p><p>Mentally struggling, the young elf took a deep breath and nodded his head at the small red man.  A large smile came across the red man as the small item was placed on the ground between them.  Aefir bade them to instruct a to the ways of the artifact.  The small red man approached, eyes wide.  </p><p></p><p>As he reached out and touched the object, there was a bright flash and a deafening boom.  The eladrin raised his shield, covering himself and his brother.  The behemoth cried out in surprise.  When the dust settled, the artifact still stood on the ground, the behemoth was looking on the scene in awe.  The brothers were safe, however Aefir quickly dropped his shield as it was burning his arm.  The large, red skinned man turned and disappeared, leaving his laughter echoing after him.  The warrior eladrin took out his sword and prodded the shield, finally turning it over.  On the front was the face of the small red skinned man, surrounded by scenes of the utmost hell.  As the brothers watched more, the face was twisted and finally morphed into the rest of the background, leaving the shield a scary, horned mess of it's former self.</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>From what Dieter can tell, gleaning some words he might have heard Maouelue use, the front page is a description of the book, which heavily suggests these are just children's stories, nothing is to be taken literally.  The back pages, however, are some higher concept, philosophical writing about the nature of these folk stories and their possible truth.  Most are notes written by someone who has been trying to find the source of these fables.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter commits this all to memory, and his pockets, as he stows the book in his pack. His sinews a bit achey as he arises, the impetuous druid lets out a yawn now a yelp now a growl, startling the others into stirring from their slumbers.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Flayco burps.</p><p>Shelli schlurps.</p><p>and Jaecob...</p><p>well, let's just let sleeping dogs lie.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>After a few reorientating moments, the crew takes some time to survey the scene and decide on the next course of action.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The room is just as the group had found it - surgical table with rotting mind flayer on it, books and supplies everywhere.  There are a couple chests and cabinets around the room, all closed.  The doors to the vault have remained solid through their slumber.  The downside of that, though...  they're completely sound-proof.  Good for hiding.  Bad for knowing what's been happening on the other side of the wall...</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The group exchanges a few dark looks and Dieter mentions that it might be a good time to check over his spells while Jaecob loots the cabinets.</p></div>
<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The first chest Jaecob lifts on emits a gas of green smoke that smells of rotten flesh, backing him up (but not hurting him at all).  The smell quickly fills the room.  (Constitution saves for everyone, please!)</p><p></p><p>Inside are broken glass jars.  They used to house what look to be bits of flesh or maybe organs of some kind, but all have given way to decay.  Green slime and even a few mold patches cover the inside of the chest.</p><p></p><p>Jaecob goes to open a few more chests and drawers, finding more of the same, and some mundane items - quills, parchment, leather for binding, a wax sealer with a block of black sealing wax.  One of the drawers has a small coffer box containing 58 gold and 18 silver.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Thanks Jaecob, you can just put that right here." Dieter gestures to his pouch. "I'll just be another few minutes."</p></div>

<div class="character-2"></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The others begin to stir as Dieter, lost in his thoughts, has begun to unwittingly read aloud.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>The waking grunts from the menagerie break his concentration and after a moment of confusion, he smiles warmly at the lot of them.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>"Sorry, I lost myself for a bit there. I'm thinking about spells, you see...."</p><p></p><p><i>Blank stares greet this proclamation.</i></p></div>

<div class="character-0"><p>A gaggle of eyeballs and tentacles look on in obfuscated amusement and curiosity.</p></div>
<div class="character-1"><p>The stone rolls smoothly away from the group, letting the fog escape into the pit room.  Sqeaks and squeals can be heard beyond the moving doors, along with a few <i>oohs</i> and <i>aahs</i>.  A low chittering is heard underneath the low din, and as the fog billows then starts to clear, miniature dragon-men are standing, staring at the newcomers from the portal in the wall.  (Nature check for what they are.  Does anyone speak undercommon by chance?)</p></div>

<div class="character-1"><p>They are, in fact, kobolds, but they're not exactly like the textbook variety.  These are paler, and they're not speaking draconic or common.</p></div>
<div class="character-0"><p>Dieter produces a small flame and sets it at the back of the chamber so as to produce a backlight for the fog, making their entrance appear almost divine. Jaecob heaves again at the doors and Dieter steps out holding this bladestaff aloft with two hands in the air.</p></div>
